            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

For although both the remembrance of the father who is dead, doth retaine that reuerence with mee which it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth; and I doe alſo as becommeth mee reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence the ſonne: yet the importunatenes of certaine did inforce me to put out their names in this ſecond edition, who being incenſed againſt me with a furious hatred and feare, leaſt the maieſtie of kings doe pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe ſome fauor to my writings, do boaſt abroad that they did conceiue ſore diſpleaſure, that their name was mixed with the doctrine of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments which they them ſelues diſalow. I leaue it indifferent whether that be true or no, neither doe I paſſe: foraſmuch as I did neither hunt after anie priuate gaine, ne yet ſeeke to win fauor. But becauſe it ſeemed to me an vndecent and filthie thing, to enforce thoſe bookes vpon men which are vnwilling to entertaine them, which doe find willing readers inough, it was worth the declaring now, that I neuer did think any thing leſſe: but that I did hope for more courteſie than I found. In that trulie there can be no offence, if withdrawing my ſelfe from the contempt of thoſe who loath my dutifulneſſe, I ſuffer them to enioy thoſe delights of theirs which they deſire, and wherein they delight. Of you (moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous prince) haue I made choiſe not without good cauſe, whom I might put in the place of two: both becauſe I thinke you moſt worthie, to haue your name appeare in the ſpirituall building of Chriſtes temple: neither doe I feare but that my booke ſhall finde the ſame friendſhip at your handes, which you did vouchſafe to declare towardes mee in your moſt gentle letters. But omitting at this time the reſpect of priuate good will, I will ſtay in another thing. Moreouer I may full well applie vnto you that ſpeech which I had before with another. Neither am I deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in this place to commend thoſe moſt excellent vertues wherwith you haue purchaſed great authoritie &amp; ſingular fauor with the king of Polonia: I am rather bent vnto an exhortation, the ſumme wherof ſhall be this, that with the like readines &amp; ioifulnes wherwith you haue at the beginning receiued the pure doctrine of the Goſpell, that with the like ſtoutnes of courage wherwith you haue hitherto indeuored to maintain the true worſhip of God, you do with the ſame co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtancie proſecute this courſe vnto the end.

               </gap>e nothing more then, than the frank profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb facs="tcp:7788:5"/> and free ſtudie of godlines, yet ſo ſoone as the truth of the Goſpell of Chriſte did once ſhine and appeare vnto you, you did not feare by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing your name to prouoke their hatred againſt you. Neither doe thoſe offices and good turnes deſerue ſmall prayſe, which you did not ceaſe to beſtow vpon the cheriſhing and increaſing of the firſt beginnings of the Church: although this your diligence did purchaſe vnto you great enuie amongeſt manie noble men, which did not allowe the ſame. But becauſe you haue no leſſe harde ſtraites to paſſe through, you muſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes ſtirre vp and encourage your ſelfe to ouercome them all, vntill you haue finiſhed the laſt act: And ſo much the more carefully, becauſe manie princes, although they ſee the eſtate of the Church filthily cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, yet dare they attempt no remedie: becauſe that daunger which they feare will proceede from innouation, when euilles muſt bee driuen out of their olde and quiet poſſeſſion, doth hinder and keepe them back from doing their dutie. Other ſome thinke it to be an abſurde and foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh thing, to touch or ſet hande to diſeaſes which are vncurable. Other ſome (I cannot tell through what frowardneſſe) doe flie from and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre all manner of reformation. But to intreate of thoſe lets where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with you are enuironned on euerie ſide, it were ſuperfluous, eſpeciallie ſeeing you knowe them well enough: Yet howſoeuer Sathan doeth aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault you, and with what combats ſoeuer he doth exerciſe you, you can not without great wickedneſſe bee wearie of this holy warfare, which you haue profeſſed vnder Chriſte his banner. Furthermore, although you bee forwarde enough of your ſelfe: yet I hope it will neither bee troubleſome, neither yet vnprofitable for you to haue your proſperous courſe of your earneſt ſtudie, holpen and furthered with this help which God doeth offer vnto your handes by mee. So often as wee ſee thinges toſſed to and fro, and as it were turned topſie turuie in the world, there can no more fit and ſure proppe bee found to eſtabliſhe and ſtay our weake conſciences, than when as ſetting before our eyes the kingdome of Chriſte, as it doth nowe appeare, wee conſider what hath been the eſtate and condition of the ſame from the beginning. When we ſpeake of the kingdome of Chriſt, wee muſt reſpect two thinges: the doctrine of the Goſpell, wherby Chriſt doth gather vnto himſelfe a church, and whereby he gouerneth the ſame, beeing gathered together: Secondly, the ſocietie of the godly, who beeing coupled togeather by the ſincere faith of the goſpel, are truly accounted the people of God. Both which things howe liuely they are expreſſed by Luke in the Actes of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, it is better to knowe by the reading of the whole book, than to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue either my commendation or the commendation of anie man els. For although the ſonne of GOD hath alwayes reigned, euen from the firſt beginning of the worlde: yet after that beeing reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the fleſhe, hee publiſhed his Goſpell, hee beganne then to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect a more famous Tribunall ſeate than before, whence hee doeth now appeare moſt plainely and to be alſo moſt glorious. If we turne our eies hither, they ſhalbe fedde, not with a vaine picture (as <hi>Virgil</hi> ſaith of his <hi>Aeneas</hi>) but with the ſound knowledge of thoſe things from which we
<pb facs="tcp:7788:5"/> muſt fetch life. And to the end I may returne vnto that whereof I deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to ſpeak; this is the beſt refuge for the conſcience of men, where they may quietly reſt amidſt theſe troubleſome tempeſts, wherewith the world is ſhaken. Finally, this meditation alone ſhall bring to paſſe, that that ſhall neuer befall vs, which too too many experiments do proue to haue ben truely ſpoken by <hi>Ennius</hi> in times paſt of the more part of men, that <hi>wiſedome is driuen away ſo often as the matter is handled by violence.</hi> For if in the greateſt and moſt vehement heat of combats, the ſweete har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of inſtruments was of ſuch force amongſt the Lacedemonians, that it did aſwage that furiouſnes and fearcenes which was ingendred in that warlike people, and did temper that violence, which doth then out of meaſure rage in thoſe natures, which are otherwiſe vnpatient: how much more ſhall the kingdome of Chriſt do this, by the heauenlie pleaſant tune of the holy Ghoſt, which doth not onely tame moſt cruel beaſtes, but maketh alſo Lambes of Wolues, Lyons, and Beares; which turneth ſpeares into hookes, and ſwords into ploughſhares? Therefore ſeeing that (moſt noble Prince) I offer vnto you ſuch kinde of tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as the neceſſitie of times requireth, I hope that this duetie of mine ſhall not be vnwelcome to your highnes: ſo that indeede you ſhall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue this kind of confirmation to be very profitable &amp; fit, to looke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the beginning of the Church, as it is deſcribed of Luke, wherein ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth both wonderfull power of God vnder the reproch of the croſſe, and alſo moſt valiant patience of the ſeruants of God, vnder the huge burden of troubles, and the ſucceſſe it ſelfe vncredible to the iudgement of the worlde, bringeth forth moſt plentifull fruite of both. But that I may omit other things which you had better ſet out by reading of Luke himſelfe, I will touch one thing which is proper to earthly princes, and the chiefe gouernours of kingdomes and countries: To wit, that ſeeing that (the power of the whole world gaineſaying, and al men which were then in authoritie being armed to oppreſſe the Goſpel) a few men, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, vnarmed and contemptible, truſting onely to the aid of the truth &amp; the ſpirit, did labor ſo ſtoutly in ſpreading abroad the faith of Chriſt, did refuſe no paines nor danger, did ſtand ſtoutly againſt all aſſaults, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till at length they gat the victorie: there remaineth no excuſe for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian nobles, who are of any dignitie, ſeeing God hath furniſhed them with the ſword to defend the kingdome of his ſonne, vnleſſe they bee at leaſt as conſtant and bold to take vpon them ſuch an honorable office. Furthermore, it is not my part to declare how faithfully and vprightlie I haue behaued my ſelfe in interpreting this hiſtorie. I hope ſurely my labour ſhall be fruitfull to all men. And as for you (moſt worthie prince) I muſt againe requeſt and beſeech you, that you doe both priuately ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict your ſelfe wholy vnto Chriſt his gouernement, as you haue of late happily begun: and that you woulde alſo become not onely a faithfull helper, but alſo a moſt ſtout &amp; valiant ſtanderdbearer in furthering the kingdome of Chriſt, vnto ſo manie noble men, whom not onely the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowme of their ſtocke and linage, but alſo the excellencie of their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues doth commend. God hath vouchſafed to beſtowe vpon the realme
<pb facs="tcp:7788:6"/> of Polonia a ſingular priuiledge of honor, that the better part of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility bidding adue to wicked ſuperſtitions, which are as many corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and pollutions of the worſhip of God, ſhould deſire with one conſent a true forme of godlines, and a well framed and reformed order of the Church. It is well knowne that theſe men were not a little aided by your authoritie. But there remaine more cumbats both for you, and alſo for them, than that like ouerworne ſouldiers, you ſhould giue your ſelues to idleneſſe and reſt. Firſt, although no forraine enimy trouble you, you ſhal haue buſines inough to withſtande thoſe euils which are at home with you. You haue ſufficiently tried with how many ſleights Sathan is furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, that he may worke ſome pollicie to ouerthrow that holy concorde amongſt brethren, wherein conſiſteth the ſafetie of the Church. That befalleth you which is common euerie where, for troubleſome men to thruſt in themſelues when things are out of order: who whileſt they ſee a few, and thoſe weaklings troubled by a great multitude, and that they do with much adoe defend the trueth, which is couered with the thicke clouds of falſe accuſations, they doe more eaſilie come vpon them vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares. And by this ſubtiltie doeth that chiefe worker of all diſceite and guile, ſeeke the ruine of the Church, not onely by cutting, mangling, and pulling in pieces the vnitie of the faith, but by burdening the name of Chriſt with falſe enuie: becauſe the companies of the godly amongſt whom theſe wicked knaues mixe themſelues, ſeeme to bee certaine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacles and ſinkes of all filthineſſe. So whileſt that <hi>Stancharus,</hi> a man of a troubleſome nature, doth through that ambition wherewith hee is wholelie ſet on fire, ſpread abroad amongſt you his dotings, hereupon brake out that contention which threatneth ſome ſcattering abroade: and you were laide open vnto the ſlaunders of many, becauſe it was thought that his ſect did ſpreade it ſelfe farther. Beholde on the other ſide a certaine Phiſition called <hi>George Brandata</hi> worſe than <hi>Stancarus,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his errour is more deteſtable, and becauſe hee hath in his minde more ſecrete poiſon. For which cauſe theſe alſo are the more worthie to be reprooued, at whoſe hands the vngodlineſſe of <hi>Seruetus</hi> hath found ſuch fauour of ſuch a ſuddaine. For although I am perſwaded, that they are farre from thoſe peruerſe and ſacriligious opinions: yet they ſhould haue taken better heede and not haue ſuffered this foxe craftilie to creepe into their companie, becauſe ſuch plagues wil neuer be wanting; neither will Sathan euer ceaſe to bring abroad into the forefront ſuch champions as haue giuen ouer themſelues to ſerue him, that hee may trouble the beginninges of the Goſpel, it is for you to bee continually in a redineſſe: and to the ende you may preuent greater euils, you muſt ſet downe a right and godly manner of gouernment, which is the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full keeping of holie peace. For as it is manifeſt that puritie of doctrine is the ſoule of the Church: ſo wee may full well compare Diſcipline vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Sinowes, wherewith the bodie being bounde and knitte togither doth maintaine his ſtrength. Now on the otherſide the vngodlineſſe of other enimies ought to ſharpen your ſtuddie and earneſtneſſe, I meane the preachers of Antichriſt of Rome, who to the end they may
<pb facs="tcp:7788:6"/> diſceiue the ignorant doe continually with ſhrill voice ſounde out the name of the Church. There is no controuerſie amongſt vs about the Church, but all graunt that the authoritie thereof ought to bee reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced of all the children of God: ſaue onely that they vnder falſe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of honor do make the ſhadowiſh name of the Churche, ſubiect to their luſtes: we do ſo reuerence the Church from our heart, that we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it great wickedneſſe to prophane the ſacred name thereof. That I may omitte other godlie miniſters of pure and ſound doctrine, I my ſelfe haue againe and againe heretofore in manie places handled this queſtion: when mention is made of the Church, whoſe heade is the ſonne of God: and which he, who is the fountaine of life eternall, doth alwayes quicken by his ſpirite: how ridiculous a thing it is to bring forth a bodie without an heade, and ſecondly a deade carkaſſe. The hireling flatterers of the Pope, doe crie out that they haue the Church. But we can knowe by no meanes better, whither this be true or no, than when wee looke vnto the heade. As for that, it is manifeſt, that it is cut off by their ſacrilegious violence. For how ſhall Chriſt retaine the place of the heade, being diſpoiled of all his power, throwne downe from his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, depriued of his dignitie? Vppon this condition hath the heauenlie father made him the heade of the Church, that he may go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne all men from the greateſt to the leaſt, by the doctrine of his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel: that hee may bee the onely prieſt, to reconcile the father conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuallie, as hee hath once appeaſed his wrath by the ſacrifice of his death: that his death may continuallie purge our ſinnes: that his blood may be the only waſhing: that his obedience may be a perfect ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: that hee may be a continuall and ſole interceſſour, through whoſe meanes our prayers may be hearde: that hee may be a faithfull defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour and tutour, that hee may by his aide defende vs: that (the vices of our fleſhe beeing tamed) hee may refourme vs vnto righteouſneſſe and holineſſe: that hee alone may beginne and finiſh in vs a bleſſed life. If the Papiſtes haue left him any of theſe thinges, let them haue the Church on their ſide. But if the Pope oppreſſing mens conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences with his fearce and more than cruell tyrannie, haue diſanulled and taken awaie Chriſt his gouernement: if hee haue brought in a forme of gouernement, altogither contrarie to the doctrine of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel: if hee haue inuented a newe and ſtraunge prieſthood, that hee may thruſt in himſelfe being but a mortall man, to bee the media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour betweene GOD and the worlde: if hee haue forged daylie Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, that hee maie put them in Chriſtes place: if hee haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented a thouſande ſatisfactions for ſinnes: if hee haue brought fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned waſhings from the lake of hell, to make drie the bloode of the ſonne of God: if hee haue put in his place infinite patrons: if he haue torne in a thouſande peeces that righteouſneſſe which muſt bee ſet whollie from him: if in ſteed of the holie Ghoſt he haue erected mans freewill: it is without all queſtion that the true Chriſt is baniſhed farre from papiſtrie. For this cauſe haue I ſaide that the Papiſtes make boaſt of a deade carkaſſe in ſteed of the liuelie bodie of Chriſt,
<pb facs="tcp:7788:7"/> becauſe though they haue extinguiſhed the Doctrine of the Goſpel (which is the true ſoule of the Church, &amp; which duly doth quicken the ſame) yet they do greatly boaſt of a ſhadowiſh &amp; trifling kind of church. Wee make it full well knowne howe corrupt the puritie of doctrine is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, yea with what monſtrous errors it is polluted. They doe not onely couer all their corruptions vnder the ſhadow of the Church: but alſo complaine that we doe great iniurie to the Church, becauſe we ſay that the ſame doeth erre. But they ſhoulde firſt haue examined the doctrine, that the Church might thereby be knowne. Theſe iuſt and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt iudges wil haue the feigned title of doctrine to haue ſufficient force of preiudice to couer and ſuppreſſe the difference, and that not to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue men. For with what ſleights and leigerdemaine would they aſſaie to bleare euen daſeling eies in ſo great light? But becauſe they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt this libertie of lying a part of their tyrannie, they thinke they reigne not as they woulde, vnleſſe they reprochfully mocke miſerable ſoules. That wee may fet an example no farther, wee haue ſeene in our times, ſometime the Tridentine Fathers, ſometimes the Fathers of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonia, who although they were euen at daggers drawing among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, yet did they fome out their vaine Canons on both ſides. And ſurely if men aſſent to their principles, the triumph ſhall be prepared on both ſides. There ſit there I cannot tell how manie Biſhops, and Abbats peraduenture an hundred horned beaſtes. If the moſt fine flower of all the nation ſhould ſhine there, yet ſhould it be nothing elſe but a wicked conſpiracie againſt God. And nowe after that the Pope hath gathered togither the branne and chips of his vncleane and filthy rotten flocke, ſhall the repreſentatiue Church ſuddainly appeare there? And are they not yet aſhamed to cal that, an holy, general, and lawful Councel which doth not deſerue ſo much, as to be called a vaine and Comicall viſure of a Councel? But as for vs to whom the promiſe is made, that Antichriſt, who ſitteth in the temple of God, ſhall be deſtroyed with the breath of the Lords mouth: let not vs (I ſay) ceaſe to refute this filthie and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh impudencie, with that moſt ſacred worde, which they ſo boldlie mocke: that al men may ſee what difference there is betweene the chaſt ſpouſe of Chriſt, and the ſtinking whore of Beliall: betweene the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuarie of God, and the Brothelhouſe of Satan: betweene the ſpirituall houſe of the godly, and the ſtie of hogges: and finallie betweene the true Church, and the court of Rome. There can no more certaine or plaine demonſtration be brought concerning this matter either by <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clide,</hi> either yet by <hi>Archimedes,</hi> then if the Church, as Luke deſcribeth it, be compared with the popiſh Synagogue. Neither am I ſo ſtreit, that I would haue that confuſed lumpe, being altogither repugnant vnto the order of nature, and manner of humanitie, to be agreeable in al points to the rule of the Apoſtles, which is Angelicall and heauenlie. If they can ſhew any thing wherein they are like vnto them, they may triumph for me. But for as much as all things are contrarie, &amp; althogh the more part of men become blind willingly: (at leaſtwiſe ſeeing the whole hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens doe allow vs) we may not onely contemne their braine ſicke pride
<pb facs="tcp:7788:7"/> without any feare, but alſo freely ſpeake euill of the ſame. In the meane ſeaſon we haue no ſmall conſolation to ſupport vs: that howſoeuer the Papiſts doe ſet againſt vs with ſterne countenance, the name and title of the Church, yet we know that we fight onely againſt the profeſſed eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Chriſt. We ought aboue all thinges to deſire, that the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowmed king, who according to his wiſedome hath long agoe ſpied out the ſubtile ſleights of the Romiſh court, commanding thoſe vain Buls to auoide, wherein the Councel boaſteth a farr off, may at length more freelie applie his minde vnto the earneſt and perfect reſtoring of the Church. Yet ought no lingering to keepe you back, but euery one of you muſt with might and maine indeuour to enlarge and ſpreade abroade thoſe beginnings which are begun to ariſe ſo happilie.</p>
            <p>Farewell moſt excellent Lord, and right renowmed Prince: The Lord alwaies gouerne you with his ſpirite, amplifie by all meanes your dignitie: and bleſſe your godlie enterpriſes euen vnto the ende.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O the intent that all godly men may with more diligence reade this historie, and alſo be more deſirous thereof: it ſhall not be without profite, briefly to note what commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie they ſhall reape thereby. This is the chiefest praiſe that a prophane historie hath, namely, that it is the mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtres of life. If that narration of famous deeds which onely teacheth men what they ought to followe, or what they ought to eſchewe in their common actions, deſerue ſuch a title: of how great praiſe are the diuine hiſtories worthie, which do not onely frame the outward life of man that he may winne praiſe by vertue; but alſo (which it more) which declare vnto vs, that God from the beginning hath had a ſpeciall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard alwayes of his Church, and faithfull congregation: that he hath bene alwaies a most iust reuenger of all wrongs done vnto thoſe, that haue betaken themſelues vnto his tuition, and haue committed themſelues vnto his custodie: that he hath ſhewed himſelfe fauourable and mercifull vnto most miſerable and wretched ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: and lastly by teaching vs faith, hoiſed vs high aboue the heauens? I ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of this, that they do euerie where ſet forth the prouidence of God, that they distinguſh the true worſhip of God from the falſe, they neuer erre in the difference of vice and vertue. Although I omit nowe alſo thoſe worthie praiſes which vſe moſt commonly to bee attributed vnto the ſacred hiſtories, intending onely ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to touch thoſe, which are proper to this booke, which wee haue taken in hande. Thoſe things which Luke ſetteth before vs in this place to be learned, are not only great, but alſo of rare profite: For first in that he ſheweth that the ſpirite of God was ſent vnto the Apoſtles, he doth not only proue that Christ was faithful &amp; true in keeping his promiſe, made vnto his Apostles: but alſo he certifieth vs, that he is alwayes mindfull of his, and a perpetuall gouernour of his Church: becauſe the holy ſpirite did diſcende from heauen to this ende, whereby we learne that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of place doeth no whit hinder Christ from being preſent with thoſe that be his, at all times. Nowe heere is most liuely painted out, the beginning of Christs kingdome, and as it were the renuing of the worlde. For although the ſonne of God had gathered togither by his preaching, a certaine Church, before ſuch time as he departed out of the world yet neuertheleſſe, that was the best forme of the Church which began then, when as the Apoſtles hauing new power giuen them from aboue, began to preach, that that onely ſheapherd did both die and alſo riſe againe, that through his conduct all thoſe which were diſperſed farre and wide, vpon the face of the whole earth, might bee gathered vnto one ſheepefolde. Heere is therefore ſet downe both the beginning, and alſo the increaſing of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he Church of Christ, after his aſcenſion, whereby he was declared to be king both of heauen and earth. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore therein appeareth as well the merueilous power of Christ, as the great force and efficacie of the Goſpel it ſelfe: for in that Christ by a ſort of ſimple ſoules and of no reputation amongst men, being endued alſo with no eloquence at al, hath ſubdued the whole world ſo eaſily by the only voice of the Goſpel, whereas notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb facs="tcp:7788:8"/> Satan did reſist him with ſo manie lets: he hath ſhewed a most manifest token of his diuine power and might therein. And alſo we ſee in the ſame, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible force of the Goſpel, that it did not only come forth &amp; ſhew it ſelf, although the whole world did ſay nay, but alſo with great glorie and maiestie, make all that which did ſeeme ſtubborn, to be obedient vnto Christ. Therfore theſe few &amp; ſimple creatures, did more preuaile againſt the troubleſome tumults of the world, with the baſe &amp; ſimple ſound of their mouth, than if God ſhould openly haue thrown down lightnings from heauen. And on the other ſide, the ſpirit of God teacheth vs, that the kingdome of Christ beginneth neuer ſooner to floriſh, but by and by Sathan op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth himſelfe most furiouſly against the ſame, and vſeth all his engines either vtterly to ouerthrow, or ſore to ſhake the ſame. Neither are we onely taught, that Sathan doth reſist Christ as an enimie, but alſo that the whole world doth furiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rage togither against him, that he may not reigne ouer them. Yea, furthermore that is to be ſet downe as a thing most certaine, that wicked men whiles they doe ſo rage against the Goſpell, doe both fight vnder Sathans banner, and are pricked forward by him into ſo blind furie. Hereupon doe ariſe ſo many vprores, ſo manie plaguie conſpiracies, ſo many diuelliſh indeuours of the reprobate, to ouerthrow the Goſpel, and to hinder the free paſſage of the ſame, which Luke ſetteth downe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most in euery place. Lastly, like as the Apostles haue indeede tried, that the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Goſpel is a fire and a ſword, ſo may we learne by their experience that it will alwaies come to paſſe, not onely by the obstinate malice of Satan, but alſo by the fatall ſtubbornnes of men, that the Goſpel ſhal ſuffer many conflicts, and that thereby many tumultes ſhalbe raiſed. But on the other ſide he declareth that the Apostles with a ſtout ſtomacke, with a liuely courage, and inuincible valiantneſſe of minde, did notwithstanding execute the office which they knewe was inioyned them by God: &amp; alſo what innumerable troubles they ſuffered with great perſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, what weriſomnes they paſſed ouer, how patiently they ſusteined most cruel perſecution; and lastly how meekely they ſuffered reproch, ſorow, and calamitie of all ſortes. And we must learne patience by ſuch examples, ſeeing the ſonne of God hath pronounced that the croſſe and tribulation ſhall alwaies accompanie his Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel: we must not pamper and cheriſh our ſelues with a vaine hope, as though the ſtate and condition of the Church ſhould be quiet, proſperous, and floriſhing heere vpon earth. Let vs therefore addreſſe our ſelues to ſuffer the like things. And that is added as no ſmall comfort for vs, that as God hath merueilouſly deliuered his Church in times past, being afflicted, and oppreſſed ſo many waies: ſo he will at this day be preſent with vs alſo: For ſurely ſeeing that in this booke is declared howe that God by his mightie hand &amp; outstretched arme alone, doth continually defend his Church, being amidst continuall deathes: God himſelfe by this meanes ſetteth before our eies his continuall prouidence in procuring the ſafetie thereof. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more here are ſet downe certaine ſermons of the Apostles, which intreate in ſuch ſort of the great mercies of God, of the grace of Christ, of the hope of bleſſed immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie, of the calling vpon God, of repentance and the feare of God, and alſo of other principall pointes of Christian doctrine, that we neede not ſeeke the whole ſum of godlineſſe any where elſe. But that I may nowe omit the declaration of ſound and pure doctrine: If that be a thing most needfull to be knowne, namely: to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand how the Church of Christ first began: how the Apostles began to preach the Goſpel; what ſucceſſe they had in the ſame, what cruel combats they ſuffered, how
<pb facs="tcp:7788:9"/> manfully they paſſed through ſo many lets, and impediments, how couragiouſly they triumphed ouer all the pride of the world, vnder the reproch of the croſſe, how won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully God was preſent with them: then must wee highly esteeme of this Booke, which vnles it were extant, the knowledge of ſo great things ſhould either be quite buried, or greatly obſcured, or wrapped in diuers doubtes. For we ſee that Sathan vſed all his engins that he might, to bring to paſſe, that neuer any of the acts of the Apoſtles might come to light, but ſuch onely as were mixed with lies; to the end he might bring into ſuſpition what thing ſoeuer was ſpoken of them, and ſo by that meanes might plucke out of the mindes of the godly, all the remembrance of that age. For hee alwaies raiſed vp, either doting fooles, or craftie flowters, that they might ſpread abroade a ſort of filthie fables, vnder the names of other men; the blockiſhnes whereof did much diſcredite euen the true histories. So in thoſe bookes of Peter and Paul which are faigned to be of Linus his doing, are conteined ſuch a ſort of ſtinking trifles, that they cauſe the wicked to laugh at them, and the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to loath them. So that feigned diſputation of Peter with Symon Magus, is ſo ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous, that it doeth diſcredite the name of a Christian. The ſame opinion must we haue of all that mingle mangle which is ſet before the recognitions and councels of Clement, and recited of Gratianus in his fragments, they beguile the vnskilful vnder colour of ancient names, the wicked boast of thoſe as of oracles, no leſſe boldly than impudently, when as in deede they are filthie toies. Sathan did vſe ſuch liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to lie, that we might haue no certaine thing left vs, after Christs aſcenſion. So that vnleſſe this work of Luke were extant, it might ſeeme that Chriſt being taken vp into heauen, left no fruit of his death or reſurrection vpon earth. For all ſhould haue vaniſhed away with his bodie. We ſhould not know that Christ was ſo recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued into his celestiall glorie, that neuertheles hee beareth rule in all the world: we ſhould not know that the Goſpel was publiſhed by the Apostles, and ſo came from them vnto vs, though by the meanes of others: we ſhould not know that they were inſpired by the holy Ghost, least they ſhould teach any thing but that which was diuine, to the end our faith might be grounded onely vpon the vnfallible veritie of God. Last of all we ſhoulde not knowe that that Propheſie of Eſaias was fulfilled, wherein he foretold that the law ſhould come out of Sion, and the word of the Lord out of Ieruſalem. Seeing this booke proceeding no doubt from the ſpirite of God, taketh from vs all doubting of theſe thinges, wee must count the ſame as a great treaſure, as I haue ſaid before not without cauſe, and nowe againe confirme the ſame.</p>

And he briefly ſetteth downe this deſcription of the hiſtorie of the Goſpel, that it is a narration of thoſe thinges which Chriſt did &amp; ſaid ſo long as he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſant vpon earth. Furthermore whereas they interpret this common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, that there was firſt in Chriſt puritie of life, before ſuch time as hee began to preach, it maketh nothing vnto Luke his mind. Truth it is, that the manners of a good and godly teacher ought ſo to be framed, that he ſpeake firſt with his life, then with his tongue, otherwiſe he ſhould differ nothing from a ſtage plaier.<note place="margin">Luk. 24.19.</note> But Luke hath reſpect rather vnto that which he had ſaid about the end of his Goſpel, namely, that Chriſt was a prophet mightie in deed and word, that is, ſuch a one as did excell no leſſe in deeds than in words: Although there be but ſmall difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt theſe two places. For the mightines of works which is comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded there, doth belong vnto his miracles, but this, To do, doth reach further in my opinion, namely, that vnder the ſame are comprehended all the famous acts which were proper vnto his miniſtrie, wherein his death &amp; reſurrection are the chiefeſt. For the office of the Meſſias did not onely conſiſt in doctrine, but it was alſo behoueful that he ſhould make peace betweene God and man, that he ſhould be a redeemer of the people, a reſtorer of the kingdome, and an author of euerlaſting felicitie. Al theſe things, I ſay, as they were promiſed of the Meſſias, ſo were they loked for at his hands. Now we ſee that the ſum of the Goſpel conſiſteth of theſe two parts, namely of the doctrin of Chriſt, &amp; of his actes: for as much as he did not onely bring vnto men that embaſſage which was giuen him in charge of his father: but alſo performed al things that could be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the Meſſias. He began his kingdome, he pacified God with his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, he purged mans ſins with his owne precious blood, hee ſubdued death and the diuel, he reſtored vs vnto true libertie, he purchaſed righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes &amp; life for vs. And to the end, that whatſoeuer he either did or ſaid might be certaine, he proued himſelf by miracles to be the ſonne of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:7788:10"/> God. So that this worde to Doe, is extended vnto his miracles alſo: but it muſt not be reſtreined onely vnto the ſame. Heere muſt we note that thoſe which haue onely the bare knowledge of the hiſtory, haue not the Goſpel: vnleſſe the knowledge of the doctrine which maketh manifeſt the fruits of the Actes of Chriſt, be adioyned thereunto. For this is a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knot which no man may diſſolue. Therefore whenſoeuer mention is made of the doctrine of Chriſt, let vs learne to adioyne thereunto his workes, as ſeales whereby the truth therof is eſtabliſhed and confirmed, and the effect declared. Furthermore that we may reape commoditie by his death and reſurrection, and alſo that miracles may haue their vſe, we muſt alwayes haue reſpect vnto him that ſpeaketh. For this is the true rule of Chriſtianitie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of all things which he began.</hi> I do not greatly miſlike the interpretation which ſome giue of this place, that Luke ſaide rather <hi>of all,</hi> then <hi>all,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is poſſible in ſome meaſure, to intreat of the workes and doctrin of Chriſt. But to ſet downe the whole courſe, that the narration may be perfect, were a matter of great weight. Like as Iohn doth declare that the world could not conteine the bookes.<note place="margin">Iohn. 21.25.</note> That is alſo to be noted, that Luke ſaith, that he began his hiſtorie at the beginning of the workes of Chriſt. But ſo ſoon as he hath declared the natiuity of Chriſt, he paſſeth ouer vnto the twelfth yeare of his age:<note place="margin">Luke. 2.42.</note> and after he had briefly ſpoken of his diſputation had in the temple with the doctors, paſſing ouer XVIII. yeares without ſpeaking any thing of them, he entereth the iuſt narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the workes of Chriſt. It is therefore manifeſt that thoſe workes and ſayings onely, which make any thing vnto the ſum of our ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are noted in this place. For after that Chriſt came abroad into the world clothed with our fleſh, he liued priuatly at home vntil he was XXX. yeeres of age, at which time his Father put vpon him another manner of perſon. God woulde haue him to leade the former part of his life ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely, to this ende, that the knowledge of theſe things might be more excellent which do edifie our faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The former ſpeech.</hi> It ſeemed good to me, to tranſlate this on this wiſe, becauſe <hi>logon poieſdhai,</hi> is the ſame with the Grecians which <hi>verba facere,</hi> or, to ſpeak, is with the Latins, as Budaeus doth note. And we muſt vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the contrarietie of the ſecond part, which he taketh in hand, that we may knowe that the Euangeliſt determined with himſelfe afreſh, to write, hauing new matter whereupon to write.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Euen vntill that day.</hi> Therefore the aſcention of Chriſt is the ende of the hiſtorie of the Goſpel. For hee hath aſcended, ſaith Paul, that hee might fulfill all things.<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4.10</note> Our faith gathereth other fruite thereby: but it ſhall be ſufficient to note in this place, that our redemption was fullie complete and finiſhed then, when Chriſt did aſcend vnto his Father: and therefore that Luke did fully performe his duetie in this narration, as touching the doctrine and workes of Chriſt. And he is ſaid to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vp, that wee may know that he is truly departed out of this worlde, leaſt we ſhould conſent vnto their dotings, who think, that in his aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion there was no alteration of place made.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Commandement by the holy Ghost.</hi> Luke ſheweth in theſe wordes, that Chriſt did not ſo depart out of the world, that he did no longer care for vs: for in that he hath ordained a perpetual gouernment in his Church, he thereby declareth that hee had a care to prouide for our ſaluation:<note place="margin">Mat. 28.20.</note> yea he hath promiſed that he wilbe preſent with his, to the ende, like as in deede hee is alwayes preſent by his miniſters. Luke therefore doth ſhew vnto vs, that Chriſt did no ſooner depart hence, but ſtraight waie he prouided for the gouernment of his Church: whence we may gather, that he is carefull for our ſaluation: and this his prouidence hath Paul plainly noted in the place lately cited, when he ſaith, that he hath ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled all things, making ſome Apoſtles, ſome Euangeliſts, ſome paſtors, &amp;c. But theſe commandements which the Euangeliſt ſaith, Chriſt gaue vnto his diſciples; do I interpret of the preaching of the Goſpel: like as ambaſſadors vſe to be inſtructed with certaine precepts, before they go of their ambaſſage, leaſt they ſhould raſhly attempt any thing contrarie to his will and minde that ſendeth them. And all this is ſpoken in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of that doctrine which the Apoſtles taught. The which that it may appeare more manifeſtly, euery thing is to be marked in order as it lieth. Firſt of al he ſaith, they were elect &amp; choſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Chriſt, that we may be certaine of their calling vnto that function. Neither doth he in this place ſet Gods election againſt mans merites, but onely affirmeth that they were raiſed vp by God, &amp; that they did not raſhly take vpon them this function. That is true in deede, that they were freely choſen: but nowe haue we to inquire what is Lukes drift in this place. I ſay that he hath reſpect vnto nothing elſe, but that we may bee certaine of the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Apoſtles, that we may learne not to haue reſpect vnto men, but vnto the ſon of God, the author thereof, becauſe this muſt alwayes be a maxime in the Church, that No man vſurpe any honor. Secondly, he ſaith, that they were inſtructed of Chriſt what they ſhould do. As if he ſhould ſay, that they vttered not their owne inuentions, but they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered that ſincerelie and faithfullie, which was inioyned them by their heauenly Maiſter. And to the ende that that which Chriſt taught them might bee the more reuerenced, hee addeth this, that this was done by the direction of the holy Ghoſt. Not becauſe the ſonne of God had any neede to bee guided by any other, who is eternall wiſedome: but becauſe he was alſo man, leaſt any man ſhoulde thinke that he did deliuer thoſe things vnto his diſciples, which he deliuered by mans wit and reaſon, hee calleth vs backe expreſly vnto the diuine authoritie. Like as the Lorde himſelfe doeth ſo often affirme that he taught no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but that which hee had receiued of his Father: and therefore hee ſaith, that his doctrine was not his owne. Therefore he ſignifieth that in the preaching of the Goſpel there is nothing which iſſueth from mans braine: but that it is the diuine ordinance of the ſpirit, whereunto the whole world muſt be ſubiect.</p>

                  <p n="4">
                     <hi>4</hi> And when hee had gathered them togither, hee commanded them that they ſhould not depart from Ieruſalem: but that they ſhould waite for the promiſe of the Father: whereof, ſaith he, yee haue heard of me:</p>

               <p n="3">3 <hi>Vnto whom &amp;c.</hi> He addeth this, that he might make the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be beleeued, as a thing moſt neceſſarie to be knowne, and without the which the whole Goſpel falleth flat to the ground, neither remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth there any more faith. And that I may omit to ſpeake of other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodities that come by being ignorant of the reſurrection of Chriſt: the Goſpel loſeth his whole authoritie, vnleſſe we know and be alſo fully perſwaded that Chriſt being aliue, ſpeaketh vnto vs from the heauens. Whereunto Luke hath chiefeſt reſpect in this place. Therefore that the truth hereof might not be called in queſtion, he ſaith that it was proued by many ſignes and tokens. Thoſe which Eraſmus, following an old in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter, doeth call arguments, I haue tranſlated proofes. For Ariſtotle doth call that <hi>Tecmerion</hi> in the firſt booke of his Rhetorikes, which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie in ſignes. This is therefore that which I ſaid before, that Chriſt did make manifeſt his reſurrection vnto his Apoſtles by euident tokens which did ſerue inſteed of neceſſary proofes, leaſt they ſhould doubt of the ſame. Furthermore he doth not recken vp thoſe tokens and ſignes: ſauing onely that he ſaith, that Chriſt did appeare vnto them about the ſpace of a month and one halfe oftentimes. If he had but once appeared vnto them, it might haue bin ſomwhat ſuſpicious: but in ſhewing himſelf ſo often vnto them, he diſſolueth all doubtes which might ariſe in their minds, &amp; by this meanes alſo he putteth away the reproch of the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, which he ſaid was in the Apoſtles, leaſt it diſcredit their preching.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He intreateth of the kingdome of God.</hi> He telleth vs againe that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles themſelues were well taught, before ſuch time as they tooke vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to teach others. Therfore whatſoeuer things they vttered &amp; brought to light, either by word or by writing, touching the kingdom of god, they are thoſe ſpeeches which Chriſt himſelfe vttered. And heereby doth he briefly ſet downe the end of the doctrine of the Goſpel: namelie, that God may reigne in vs. Regeneration is the beginning of this kingdome, &amp; the end therof is bleſſed immortalitie: the midle proceedings are in a more ample going forward &amp; increaſe of regeneratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But that this thing may appeare more euidently, we muſt firſt note, that we are borne, and that we liue aliants and ſtrangers from the kingdome of God, vntil ſuch time as god doth faſhion vs again vnto a new life. Therfore we may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſet the world, the fleſh, &amp; whatſoeuer is in mans nature, againſt the kingdome of God, as contrary to it. For the natural man is wholly occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied about the things of this world, and he ſeeketh felicitie here. In the mean ſeaſon we are as it were baniſhed from god, &amp; he likewiſe from vs. But Chriſt by the preaching of the goſpel doth lift vs vp vnto the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the life to come. And to the end he may the better bring this to paſſe, he reformeth all our earthly affections, &amp; ſo hauing ſtript vs out of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:7788:11" rendition="simple:additions"/> the vices of our fleſh, he ſeparateth vs from the world. And like as eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall death is prepared for all thoſe which liue after the fleſh; ſo in as much as the inward man is renewed in vs, that we may go forward in the ſpirituall life, we drawe neerer vnto the perfection of the kingdome of God: which is the ſocietie of the glorie of God. Therefore God will reigne in and amongſt vs now, that he may at length make vs partakers of his kingdom. Hereby we gather that Chriſt did principally intreat of the corruption of mankind; of the tyrannie of ſin, whoſe bondſlaues we are; of the curſſe &amp; guiltines of eternall death, whereunto we al are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, &amp; alſo of the meanes to obteine ſaluation, of the remiſſion of ſins; of the denying of the fleſh, of ſpirituall righteouſnes, of hope of eternal life, and of ſuch like things. And if we will be rightlie inſtructed in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianitie, we muſt applie our ſtudies to theſe things.</p>
               <p n="4">4 <hi>Gathering them togither he commanded, &amp;c.</hi> They had before done the dutie of Apoſtles; but that laſted but a while: and ſecondlie ſo farre forth that they might with their preaching awake the Iewes to heare their maſter. And ſo that commandement to teach, which Chriſt had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen them whiles he liued with them vpon earth, was as it were a certain entrance into their Apoſtleſhip which was to come, for which they were not yet ripe. Therfore their ordinarie function was not laid vpon them, vntill ſuch time as Chriſt was riſen againe: but they ſtirred vp their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as (I haue ſaid) like criers, that they might giue care to Chriſt. And then at length after the reſurrection they were made Apoſtles, to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh abroad throughout the whole world, that doctrine which was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And whereas after they were made Apoſtles, Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth them as yet to abſtaine from their office, that is done not with out iuſt cauſe; yea many cauſes may be alledged why it ſhold be ſo. That filthy forſaking of their maſter was yet freſh: many notes and tokens of vnbeliefe were yet freſh. Whereas they had bin ſo throughly taught and had ſo ſodainly forgotten al, they ſhewed a manifeſt token of their great dulnes of wit. Neither were they free from ſluggiſhnes, which could not otherwiſe fitly be purged, than by deferring the promiſed grace, that he might the more ſharpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their deſire. But this cauſe is chiefly to be noted, that the Lord did appoint a certaine time for the ſending of the Spirit, that the miracle might be the more apparant. Again he ſuffered them to reſt a while, that he might the better ſet forth the greatnes of that buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes which he was about to commit vnto them. And thereby is the truth of the goſpel confirmed, becauſe the Apoſtles were forbidden to addres themſelues to preach the ſame, vntill they ſhoulde be well prepared in ſucceſſion of time.</p>
               <p>And they were commanded to ſtay togither, becauſe they ſhould all haue one ſpirite giuen them. If they had bin diſperſed, the vnitie ſhould not haue bin ſo wel knowne. Though they were ſcattered abroad after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in diuers places, yet becauſe they brought that which they had fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one &amp; the ſame fountain, it was al one, as if they alwaies had had alone mouth. Furthermore it was expedient that they ſhould begin to preach the Goſpel at Ieruſalem, that the Propheſie might be fulfilled, There
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:7788:12" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſhall a law go out of Syon,<note place="margin">Eſai. 2.3.</note> &amp; the word of the Lord out of Ieruſalem. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the participle <hi>ſunalizomenos</hi> may bee diuerſly tranſlated: yet E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſmus his tranſlation did pleaſe me beſt, becauſe the ſignification of gathering togither, wil agree better with the text.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They ſhould wait for the.</hi> It was meete that theſe ſhould be accuſtomed to obey firſt, who ſhould ſhortly after lay Chriſts yoke vpon the necke of the world. And ſurely they haue taught vs by their example, that we muſt worke and reſt at the Lordes pleaſure alone. For if during our life we goe on warfare vnder his banner, and conduct: ſurely hee ought to haue no leſſe authoritie ouer vs, than anie earthlie captaine hath in his armie. Therfore as warlike diſcipline requireth this, that no man wagge, vnleſſe hee be commaunded by the captaine: ſo it is not lawfull for vs either to go out, or to attempt any thing vntill the Lord giue the watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>word: and ſo ſoone as hee bloweth the retreat, we muſt ſtaie. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer wee are taught that wee are made partakers of the giftes of God through hope. But we muſt marke the nature of hope as it is deſcribed in this place. For that is not hope, which euery man feigneth to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe vnaduiſedly, but that which is grounded in the promiſe of God. Therefore Chriſt doeth not ſuffer his Apoſtles to looke for whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer they will, but hee addeth expreſlie, The promiſe of the Father. Furthermore, hee maketh himſelfe a witneſſe thereof: becauſe wee ought to bee ſo ſure and certaine, that although all the engines of hell gaineſtande vs, yet this may remaine ſurelie fixed in our mindes, that we haue beleeued God,<note place="margin">2. Tim. 1.12</note> I knowe ſaieth Paule whom I haue beleeued. And heere hee putteth them in minde of thoſe thinges which are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in Iohn the 14. and 15. and 16. I will pray the father, and hee ſhall giue you another comforter, that hee may continue with you: I ſaie the Spirite of trueth,<note place="margin">Iohn. 14.16.14.25. Iohn. 15.26. Iohn. 16.7. Iohn. 7.38.</note> &amp;c. Againe, I haue ſpoken theſe thinges vnto you, whiles I am with you. And the Spirit whom my Father ſhall ſend in my name, ſhall teach you all thinges, &amp;c. And againe, When the Spirite of trueth ſhall come, whom I will ſende from my father, he ſhall beare witneſſe of me. And againe, If I ſhall go hence, I will ſend you the comforter, who ſhall reproue the world. And he had ſaide long before, Hee which beleeueth in mee, out of his belly ſhall flowe riuers of liuing water.</p>
               <p n="5">5 <hi>Becauſe Iohn truelie.</hi> Chriſt repeateth this vnto his Apoſtles out of Iohns owne wordes. For ſome part of them had heard that at Iohns mouth, which the Euangeliſtes report, I truely baptiſe you with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: but hee that commeth after mee, ſhall baptiſe you with the holie Ghoſt and with fire. Nowe Chriſt pronounceth that they ſhall well perceiue that that is true in deede which he ſaide. Furthermore this ſerueth greatlie to confirme the ſentence next going before. For it is an argument drawne from the office of Chriſt. And that thus:</p>
               <p>Iohn was ſent to baptiſe with water, he fulfilled his function, as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the ſeruant of God. The ſonne of God is ſent to baptiſe with the holy Ghoſt: it remaineth therefore that he do his dutie. Neither can it be otherwiſe, but he muſt doe that which his father hath commaunded
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:7788:12"/> him to do, and for which alſo he came downe into the earth. But it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth a verie abſurde thing to reſtreine that vnto the viſible ſending of the holie Ghoſt, which was ſpoken vniuerſallie of regeneration. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, that Chriſt did not then onely baptiſe with the holie Ghoſt, when as he ſent him vnder the forme of fyrie tongues: for he had baptiſed his Apoſtles before this: and he baptiſeth all the elect thus daylie. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſending of the holy Ghoſt after ſo glorious a ſort, was a token of the hidden grace, wherewith he doth daily inſpire his elect, he doth fitly applie thereunto the teſtimonie of Iohn. And truely this was as though it had beene the common baptiſme of the Church. For beſides that the Apoſtles did not receiue the ſpirit for themſelues onely, but for the vſe of all the faithfull: there was alſo declared the vniuerſall fauour of Chriſt towards his Church, whiles that he poured out thereupon the giftes of his ſpirite in great abundance. Although, therefore hee doeth daily baptiſe the elect of his father, yet was this no let why he might not ſhewe foorth this token, to be remembred aboue all other: that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles might knowe that they were onely entred by Iohn: and that not in vaine, ſeeing their perfection was harde at hande. And that is fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolous which ſome gather out of this place moſt commonly, namelie, that the baptiſme of Iohn, and the baptiſme of Chriſt were diuerſe. For heere doth not he diſpute in this place of baptiſme, but maketh onely a compariſon betwixt the perſon of Iohn &amp; the perſon of Chriſt. When as Iohn did ſay that he did baptiſe with water onely, hee did not reaſon of what ſort his baptiſme was; but what he himſelfe was: leaſt he ſhould arrogate that vnto himſelfe, which was proper to Chriſt. As alſo the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters in theſe daies ought not to ſpeake otherwiſe of themſelues: but they muſt acknowledge Chriſt to bee the author of all thoſe thinges, which they do prefigure in the outwarde baptiſme, and leaue nothing to themſelues, ſaue onely the outwarde adminiſtration. For when as theſe titles are attributed vnto baptiſme, namely, that it is the lauer of regeneration, a waſhing away of ſinnes, the fellowſhippe of death,<note place="margin">Tit. 3.5. Rom. 6.4</note> and burying with Chriſt, and a graffing into the bodie of Chriſt: it is not declared what man, being the Miniſter of the outward ſigne doth; but rather what Chriſt doeth, who onely giueth force and efficacie vnto the ſignes. We muſt alwayes hold faſt this diſtinction, leaſt whiles we decke man too much, we take from Chriſt. But here may a queſtion be moued why he doeth rather name Iohn here, than any other. Firſts, it is manifeſt ynough that Iohn did profeſſe himſelfe to bee the miniſter of the outwarde ſigne, namely, of water, and that Chriſt was the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the ſpirituall baptiſme. Secondly becauſe it was meete that Iohn ſhoulde decreaſe, and Chriſt increaſe. And thirdlie becauſe the Apoſtles did ſo much eſteeme of Iohn,<note place="margin">Iohn. 3.30.</note> it might haue beene that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the glorie of Chriſt might haue beene obſcured. Therefore Chriſt to the ende hee might reclaime them to himſelfe, telleth them that Iohn did onelie miniſter vnto them the externall baptiſme: notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding hee confirmeth them alſo, leaſt they ſhould doubt of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:7788:13"/>
               <p>For they did attribute verie much vnto Iohn, and therefore were they perſwaded that the Baptiſme which they had receiued by him, was not in vaine. Now if that the veritie and force thereof muſt be looked for at Chriſt his hands, then ought the Apoſtles, to hope that that ſhal ſurelie be fulfilled which Iohn prefigured.</p>
               <p>So muſt we in like manner thinke, that we are not in vaine baptiſed with water, by men; bicauſe Chriſt, who commaunded the ſame to bee done, will fulfill his office, and baptiſe vs with the ſpirite. So faith draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a conſequent from the outward ſigne, vnto the inwarde effect; yet doeth it not attribute anie more than is meete, either to the ſigne, or to the miniſter thereof; becauſe in the ſigne it onely looketh vnto the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, which is Chriſts, and doeth acknowledge him to be the onelie au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of grace. Let vs therefore vſe ſuch a meane that we do in no part diminiſh Chriſts honor: and yet neuertheleſſe let vs hope for that fruit by our baptiſm which is noted in this place. By aſſigning ſo ſhort a time, our ſauiour maketh them more ioyfull to hope well. Whereupon it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth that that death was not to be lamented, which brought with it preſently ſo precious fruite.

               <p n="6">6 He ſheweth that the Apoſtles were gathered togither when as this queſtion was moued, that we may know that it came not of the fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of one or two, that it was moued, but it was moued by the common co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent of them al. But merueilous is their rudenes, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as they had bin diligently inſtructed by the ſpace of three whol yeres; they bewray no leſſe ignorance, than if they had heard neuer a worde. There are as manie errors in this queſtion as words. They aske him as concerning a kingdome: but they dreame of an earthly kingdome, which ſhould flow with riches, with dainties, with externall peace, and with ſuch like good things. And whiles they aſſigne the preſent time to the reſtoring of the ſame: they deſire to triumph before the batell. For before ſuch time as they begin to worke, they will haue their wages. They are alſo greatly deceiued heerein, in that they reſtraine Chriſt his kingdome vnto the carnall Iſrael, which was to be ſpread abroade, euen vnto the vttermoſt parts of the worlde. Furthermore, there is this fault in all their whole queſtion, namely, that they deſire to know thoſe thinges which are not
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:7788:13"/> meet for them to know. No doubt they were not ignorant what the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets did propheſie concerning the reſtoring of Dauids kingdome: they had oftentimes heard their maſter preach co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning this matter. Laſtly it was a ſaying common in euerie mans mouth, that in the moſt miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble captiuitie of the people, they ſhould all bee comforted, with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectation of the kingdome that ſhould bee. Now they hoped for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring heereof at the comming of the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> And hereuppon was it, that ſo ſoone as the Apoſtles ſawe their maſter Chriſte riſen from the dead, they ſtraightway beganne to thinke thereupon: but in the meane time they declared thereby, how bad ſcholers they were vnder ſo good a maſter. Therefore doth Chriſte briefly comprehend in this ſhort an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, all the errours whereinto they fell in this their queſtion, as I ſhall ſtraightway declare. To reſtore, in this place doth ſignifie, to ſet vp again that which was fallen, and through many ruines growen out of faſhion: for out of the drie ſtocke of <hi>Iſai,</hi> ſhould ſpring a braunche, and the taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle of Dauid, which was laid waſte, ſhould bee erected and ſet on foot againe.</p>
               <p n="7">7 <hi>It is not for you to know, &amp;c.</hi> This is a generall reprehenſion of all the whole queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for it was too curious for them to deſire to know that whereof their maſter woulde haue them ignoraunt. But this is the true meanes to become wiſe: namely, to goe as farre forward in learning, as our maſter Chriſt goeth in teaching: and willingly to be ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of thoſe things, which he doth conceale from vs. But foraſmuch as there is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ingendred in vs a certaine fooliſh and vaine curioſitie, and alſo a certaine raſh kinde of boldneſſe: we muſt diligently obſerue this admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of Chriſt, whereby he correcteth both theſe vices. But to the end we may know what his meaning is hereby, we muſt mark the two mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers which he ioineth together. It is not for you (ſaith he) to know thoſe things which the father hath placed in his owne power. Hee ſpeaketh in deed of the times &amp; ſeaſons: but ſeeing there is the like reaſon in other things, we muſt thinke this to be an vniuerſall precept: that beeing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with the reuelation of God, we think it an haynous crime to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire anie further: this is the true meane betweene the two extremes. The Papiſtes, that they may haue ſomewhat wherewith to cloke their groſſe ignorance, ſay for themſelues, that they omit the hidden myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of God: as though our whole faith and religion did conſiſt vpon any thing els, than vpon the hidden myſteries of god. Then may we take our leaue of Chriſt and his Goſpell, if we muſt abſtain vtterly from the hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den myſteries of God. But we muſt keepe, as I ſaid before, a mean here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. For we muſt be deſirous to learn, ſo farre as our heauenly maſter doth teach vs: but as for ſuch things, as hee will haue vs ignorant of, let none be ſo bolde as to enquire after them, that we may be wiſe with ſobrietie. Therefore ſo often as wee are vexed with this fooliſh deſire of knowing more than we ought, let vs call to minde this ſaying of Chriſt, <hi>It is not for you to know.</hi> For vnleſſe we will burſt in againſt his will and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement: this ſhall haue force and ſtrength enough to reſtraine the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragiouſneſſe of our wits. Now as touching the foreknowledge of times,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:7788:14"/> Chriſt condemneth only the ſearching out therof, which reacheth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the meaſure of Gods reuelation, &amp; that is to bee noted out of the ſecond member, as before I haue ſaide: which the father hath placed in his owne power. Truth it is that God hath in his owne power, Winter &amp; Sommer, and the reſt of the ſeaſons of the yeere, cold &amp; heat, faire we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther &amp; foule. But becauſe he hath teſtified that the courſe of the yeeres ſhalbe perpetuall, he is ſaid not to haue placed that in his owne power, which he hath reuealed vnto men. What thing ſoeuer the philoſophers or husbandmen doe comprehend or vnderſtand by Art, by learning, by iudgement,<note place="margin">Gen. 8.22.</note> or experience, all that doth God not reteine vnto himſelfe, becauſe he hath after a certaine ſort reueiled it vnto them. The ſame o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> muſt we haue of the prophets: for it was their office to know thoſe things which God did reueale. But wee muſt be ignorant of the ſecrete euentes of thinges, as touching the time to come. For there is nothing which may make vs more ſlack in doing our duties, than too carefull an inquiſition herein. For we wil alwaies take counſell according to the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture euent of things, but the Lord by hiding the ſame from vs, doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe vnto vs what we ought to do. Here ariſeth a conflict, becauſe wee will not willingly ſuffer God to haue that which is his own: namely, the ſole gouernment &amp; direction of thinges which are to come: but wee caſt our ſelues into a ſtrange &amp; inordinate carefulneſſe. To conclude, Chriſt forbiddeth vs to applie thoſe thinges vnto our ſelues, which God doeth chalenge as proper to himſelfe alone. Of this ſort is the foreknowledge of thoſe things which god hath taken to himſelf to gouerne &amp; direct, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his owne pleaſure, far contrary to our opinion, and otherwiſe than we could inuent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You ſhal receiue power.</hi> Our ſauiour Chriſt doth here call them backe as wel vnto the promiſe of god, as alſo vnto his commandment, which was the readieſt way to bridle their curioſitie. Curioſitie doth riſe almoſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies either of idlenes or els of diſtruſt: diſtruſt is cured by meditating vpon the promiſes of god. And his commandements do tell vs how wee ought to occupy our ſelues &amp; imploy our ſtudies. Therfore he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth his diſciples to wait for the promiſe of God, &amp; to be diligent in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuting their office wherunto God had called them. And in the meane ſeaſon he noteth their great haſtineſſe, in that they did prepoſterouſly catch at thoſe gifts which wer proper vnto the holy Spirit, whenas they were not as yet indued with the ſame. Neither did they take the right way herein, in that being called to goe on warfare, they deſire (omitting their labor) to take their caſe in their ynne. Therefore when he ſaith <hi>you ſhal receiue power:</hi> he admoniſheth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their imbecillitie, leaſt they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low before the time, thoſe things wherunto they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not attain. It may be read very wel either way, You ſhall receiue the power of the ſpirite: or, The ſpirit comming vpon you: yet the latter way ſeemeth to be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, becauſe it doth more fully declare their defect and want, vntill ſuch time as the Spirite ſhould come vpon them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You ſhall be my witneſſes.</hi> He correcteth two errors of theirs in this one ſentence. For firſt he ſheweth that they muſt fight, before they can tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph: and ſecondly, that the nature of Chriſt his kingdome was of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:7788:14"/> ſort than they iudged it to haue been. Therfore faith he, <hi>You ſhalbe my witneſſes:</hi> that is, the husbandman muſt firſt work before he can reape his fruites. Hence may we learne, that we muſt firſt ſtudie how wee may come vnto the kingdome of God, before wee begin to diſpute about the ſtate of the life to come. Manie there be, which doe curiouſly enquire what maner bleſſednes that ſhall bee, which they ſhall inioy after they ſhalbe receiued into the euerlaſting kingdome of heauen: not hauing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie care how they may com to inioy the ſame. They reaſon concerning the qualitie of the life to come, which they ſhall haue with Chriſte.<note place="margin">2. Tim. 2.11</note> But they neuer thinke that they muſt bee partakers of his death, that they may liue together with him. Let euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> therfore applie himſelf in his work, which he hath in hand: let vs fight ſtoutly vnder Chriſt his banner: let vs go forward manfully &amp; couragiouſly in our vocation, and God wil giue frute in due time &amp; tide. There followeth another correction, when he ſaith, that they muſt be his witneſſes. For hereby hee meant to driue out of his diſciples minds that fond &amp; falſe imagination, which they had conceiued of the terreſtrial kingdome, becauſe hee ſheweth vnto them brieflye, that his kingdome conſiſteth in the preaching of the Goſpell. There was no cauſe therefore why they ſhould dreame of riches, of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall principalitie, or any other earthly thing, whileſt they heard that Chriſt did then reigne, when as he ſubdueth vnto himſelf all the whole worlde by the preaching of the Goſpell. Wherupon it followeth that he doth reigne ſpiritually, &amp; not after any worldly maner. And that which the Apoſtles had conceiued of the carnall kingdom, proceded from the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon error of their nation. Neither was it maruell if they were decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued herein. For when we meaſure the ſame with our vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, what els can we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiue, but that which is groſſe &amp; terreſtrial? Hereupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, that like brute beaſts we only deſire that which is commodius for our fleſh, &amp; therfore we rather catch that which is preſent. Wherfore we ſee that thoſe which held opinion, that Chriſt ſhould reigne as a king in this world a thouſand yeres, fel into the like follie. Heereupon alſo they applied al ſuch propheſies as did deſcribe the kingdom of Chriſt figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely by the ſimilitude of earthly kingdoms vnto the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modity of their fleſh: wheras notwithſtanding it was gods purpoſe to lift vp their minds higher. As for vs, let vs learne to apply our mindes to heare the Goſpel preached, leaſt we bee intangled in like errors, which prepareth a place in our hearts for the kingdome of Chriſt.</p>

                  <hi>In all Iudea.</hi> Here he ſheweth firſt that they muſt not work for the ſpace of one day only, whlie that he aſſigneth the whole worlde vnto them in which they muſt publiſh the doctrin of the goſpel.

Neither could they be a little afraide to come before ſo cruell e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, more to inflame their rage and furie.

For if ſo be it he had vaniſhed away ſecretly, then might the diſciples haue doubted what was become of him: but now ſith that they being in ſo plain a place, ſaw him taken vp, with whom they had been conuerſant, whom alſo they hearde ſpeake euen now, whom they beheld with their eies, whom alſo they ſee taken out of their ſight by a cloude, there is no cauſe why they ſhoulde doubt whither he was gone. Furthermore the angels are there alſo to beare witneſſe of the ſame. And it was needfull that the hiſtorie ſhoulde haue been ſet downe ſo diligently for our cauſe, that we may know aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly, that although the ſonne of God appeare no where vpon earth, yet doth he liue in the heauens. And this ſeemeth to be the reaſon, why the cloude did ouerſhadow him, before ſuche time as hee did enter into his celeſtiall glorie: that his diſciples beeing content with their meaſure might ceaſe to enquire any further. And we are taught by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that our minde is not able to aſcend ſo high, as to take a full view of the glory of Chriſt: therefore let this cloud be a meane to reſtraine our boldneſſe, as was the ſmoke which was continually before the dore of the tabernacle<note n="*" place="margin">Or, vnder the lawe.</note> in the time of the lawe.</p>
               <p n="10">10 <hi>Two men,</hi> Hee calleth them ſo, by reaſon of their forme. For although it might be that they had the bodies of men in deed, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning which thing I will not greatly ſtande in defence of either part, yet
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:7788:15" rendition="simple:additions"/> certaine it is, they were not men. But becauſe this <hi>Metonymia</hi> is commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vſed in the ſcriptures, eſpecially in the firſt booke of Moſes: I will not greatly ſtand thereupon. Their white garments were a token of rare &amp; excellent dignitie. For God meant by this, as by an euident token to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh them from the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſort of people, that the diſciples might giue better care vnto them: and that at this day we alſo may knowe that this viſion was ſhewed them of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Yee men of Galilee, &amp;c.</hi> I am not of their opinion, who thinke that this name was giuen the Apoſtles after an opprobrious ſort, as if the Angels meant to reprehend the ſlounes &amp; dulnes of the apoſtles. In my opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it was rather to make them more attentiue, in that men whom they did neuer ſee before did name them, as though they had perfectly knowne them. But they ſeeme to be reprehended without cauſe, for looking vp into heauen. For where ſhould they rather ſeeke for Chriſt, than in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen? Doth not the ſcriptures alſo oftentimes exhort vs thereunto? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, that they were not therefore reprehended, becauſe they looked vp towardes heauen; but becauſe they coueted to ſee Chriſt, when as the cloude, which was put between them and him, did keepe them from ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him with their bodily ſenſes: Secondly, becauſe they hoped that he would returne againe ſtraight way, that they might enioy the ſight of him againe, when as he did aſcende to ſtay in the heauens, vntill ſuche time as hee ſhould come to iudge the world. Wherefore let vs firſt learn out of this place, that we muſt not ſeeke Chriſt either in heauen, either vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> earth, otherwiſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by faith: &amp; alſo that we muſt not deſire to haue him preſent with vs bodily in the world: for he that doth either of thoſe two, ſhal oftentimes go farther fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him. So this their admiratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, not ſimply, but inaſmuch as they were aſtonied at the ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of this matter: like as we are oftentimes carried vnaduiſedly into a wonderfull great wondering at Gods workes: but we neuer applie our ſelues to conſider for what end and putpoſe they were done.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ieſus, which is taken vp into heauen.</hi> There are two members in this one ſentence. The firſt is, that Chriſte was taken vp into heauen, that they may not hence foorth fooliſhly deſire, to haue him any longer conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant with them vpon earth. The other is ſtraightway added as a conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, concerning his ſecond comming. Out of theſe two iointly and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſeuerally is gathered a firm, ſtable, and ſtrong argument, to refute the Papiſts, and all other which imagine that Chriſt is really preſent in the ſignes of bread and wine. For when it is ſaid that Chriſt is taken vp into heauen: heere is plainely noted the diſtance of place. I graunt that this word <hi>heauen,</hi> is interpreted diuers waies, ſomtime for the ayre, ſometime for the whole connexion of the ſpheres, ſomtimes for the glorious king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, where the maieſtie of God hath his proper ſeat, howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it doth fill the whole world. After which ſort Paul doth place Chriſt aboue all heauens, becauſe he is aboue all the world, and hath the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt roome in that place of bleſſed immortalitie, becauſe he is more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent than all the Angels.<note place="margin">Ephe. 1.22. &amp;. 4.15.</note> But this is no let why he may not be abſent from vs bodilie, and that by this worde <hi>heauens,</hi> there may not be ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:7788:16"/> a ſeparation from the worlde. Let them cauill as much as they will, it is euident that the heauen wherinto Chriſt was receiued, is oppoſite to the frame of the worlde: therefore it doth neceſſarily folow, that if he be in heauen, he is without the world. But firſt we muſt mark what the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of the Angels was: for thereby we ſhall more perfectly know what the words mean. The angels intent was to call back the apoſtles fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the carnall preſence of Chriſt. For this purpoſe was it that they ſaid that he ſhould not come again, vntil he came to iudge the world. And to this end ſerueth the aſſigning of the time, that they might not look for him in vain before that ſame time. Who ſeeth not that in theſe words is manifeſtly ſhewed, that he was bodily abſent out of the world? who ſeeth not that we are forbidden to deſire to haue him vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the earth. But they think they eſcape ſafe with that craftie anſwere, when as they ſay that then he ſhall come viſibly: but he commeth now inuiſibly dailie. But wee are not here to diſpute of his forme, only the Apoſtles are taught, that Chriſt muſt abide in heauen, vntill ſuch time as he appeare at the latter day. For the deſiring of his corporall preſence is here condemned as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd &amp; peruerſe. The Papiſts denie that hee is preſent in the Sacrament carnally, while that his glorious body is preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t with vs after a ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſort, &amp; by a myracle: but wee may wel enough reiect their inuentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s concerning his glorious bodie, as childiſh &amp; friuolous toies. They feigne vnto themſelues a myracle not confirmed with any teſtimonie of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The bodie of Chriſt was then glorious, when as he was conuerſant with his diſciples after his reſurrection. That was done by the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie &amp; ſecret power of God: yet notwithſtanding, the angels doe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid to deſire him afterwarde after that ſort, and they ſay that he ſhal not come vnto men in that ſort before the latter day. Therfore according to their commandement, let vs not goe about to pull him out of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens with our own inuentions: neither let vs think that wee can handle him with our handes, or perceiue him with our other ſenſes, more than wee can ſee him with our eies. I ſpeake alwaies of his bodie. For in that they ſay it is infinit, as it is an abſurd dreame, ſo is it ſafely to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected. Neuertheles I willingly confeſſe that Chriſte is aſcended, that he may fulfil al things: but I ſay that he is ſpread abroad euerie wher by the power of his ſpirit, not by the ſubſtance of his fleſh. I graunt furthermore that he is preſent with vs both in his word, &amp; in the ſacraments. Neither is it to be douted, but that al thoſe which do with faith receiue the ſigns of his fleſh &amp; blood, are made truly partakers of his fleſh and blood. But this partaking doth nothing agree with the dotings of the Papiſts. For they feigne that Chriſt is preſent in ſuch ſort vpon the Altar, as <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> did call downe his <hi>Iupiter Elicius:</hi> or as thoſe witches did ſet down the Moone from heauen with their inchauntments. But Chriſt by reaching vs the bread in his ſupper, doth will vs to lift vp our hearts into heauen, that we may haue life by his fleſh &amp; blood.

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:7788:17" rendition="simple:additions"/> Peter his wife was about to bee a helper vnto him ſhortly after: which wee muſt alſo thinke of the reſt of the wiues. Theſe women had nede of heroicall fortitude and conſtancie, leaſt they ſhoulde faint. Who would therefore thinke that they were excluded from their husbands, whiles they looke for the comming of the Spirite? But if they will ſticke to the generall worde, it ſtandeth with reaſon, that there were married women in the companie. Howſoeuer it bee, it is Luke his minde to tell vs by the way how greatly they had chaunged their mindes. For whereas before the men being afraid, had fled away, the women are gathered together with them nowe: neither doe they feare any daunger. Hee doeth rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon vp the mother of Ieſus with the other women, whome notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Iohn is ſaid to haue kept at his owne houſe. But as I haue ſaide be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, they met altogether nowe onely for a ſhort ſeaſon. For it is not to bee doubted but that they departed one from another afterwarde. It is well knowne that amongeſt the Hebrewes, all kinsfolke are comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vnder this worde brethren.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>All theſe did continue.</hi> Heere hee ſheweth that they did diligentlie looke for the comming of the holy Spirite. For this was the cauſe of their Prayer, that Chriſte woulde ſende his Spirite, as hee had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Whereuppon wee may gather, that that is the true faith, which ſtirreth vs vp to call vppon God. For the ſecuritie of faith doth muche differ from ſluggiſhneſſe. Neither doeth God therefore aſſure vs of this grace, that our mindes may ſtraight way become careleſſe: but that hee may rather ſharpen our deſire to pray. Neither is prayer any ſigne of doubting, but rather a teſtimonie of our ſure hope and confidence: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe wee aske thoſe things at the Lorde his handes, which we know he hath promiſed. So it becommeth vs alſo (after their example) to bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in prayer, and to begge at Gods handes that he will increaſe in vs his holy Spirite: increaſe (I ſay) becauſe before wee can conceiue any prayer, we muſt needes haue the firſt frutes of the Spirite. For as much as hee is the onely maſter, which teacheth vs to pray aright,<note place="margin">Rom. 2.25.</note> who doeth not onely giue vs vtterance, but alſo gouerne our inwarde affections. Furthermore, Luke doth expreſſe two thinges which are proper to true prayer: namely that they did perſiſt, and that they were all of one mind. This was an exerciſe of their patience, in that Chriſte did make them ſtay a while, when as hee could ſtraightway haue ſent the holy Spirite. So God doth oftentimes driue off, and as it were ſuffer vs to languiſhe, that he may accuſtome vs to perſeuere. The haſtineſſe of our petitions is a corrupt, yea a hurtfull plague, wherefore it is no maruell if God doe ſometime correct the ſame. In the meane ſeaſon (as I haue ſaid) he doth exerciſe vs to be conſtant in prayer. Therefore if wee will not pray in vaine, let vs not be wearied with the delay of time. As touching the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of their mindes, it is ſet againſt that ſcattering abroade, which feare had cauſed before. yet notwithſtanding we may eaſily gather, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by this, how needfull a thing it is to praie generally, in that Chriſt commaundeth euerie one to pray for the whole bodie, and generally for all men, as it were in the perſon of all men: Our Father,<note place="margin">Mat. 6.9.</note> Giue vs this day, &amp;c.

We doe graunt, that as in euery aſſembly there muſt be ſome which muſt bee chiefe: ſo in this aſſembly the Apoſtles did aſcribe this honour vnto Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But what maketh this vnto the proouing of their Papacie? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore bydding them adue, let vs conſider what the Spirite doth ſpeake by the mouth of Peter. Hee ſaieth, That the Scripture muſt needes haue been fulfilled, leaſt any mans minde ſhould bee troubled with that hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible fall of Iudas. For it ſeemed a ſtraunge thing, that hee which was choſen by Chriſte vnto ſo excellent a function, ſhould ſo filthilie fall in the beginning of his courſe. Peter remooueth this ſtone of ſtumbling, when he ſaith, that it was foretolde by the ſcripture. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce we may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an admonition very neceſſarie for dailie practiſe: namely that wee ought to attribute this honour vnto the Propheſies of the ſcriptures, that they are able to appeaſe all ſuch feare as wee conceiue of the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine euent of thinges. For there is nothing which doeth more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vs, then when we ſtay ſtill in our owne ſenſe and vnderſtanding, and prcure vnto our ſelues lets &amp; doubts, which the Lord would be readie to cure, if ſo be that we woulde hold faſt this one thing, that nothing is abſurde which he hath foreſeene, appointed, and foretolde that hee might make vs more ſtrong. Neither was Iudas therefore excuſable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that which befell him was foretolde, ſeeing that he fell away, not being compelled by the Propheſie, but onely by the malice of his owne heart. The oration of Peter hath two parts. For in the firſt place he putteth away the offence, which godlie mindes might haue concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, by reaſon of the fall of Iudas: whence alſo he gathereth an exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, that the reſt may learne to feare God. Secondly, he celleth them that it remaineth that they chooſe an other into his place, both which hee proueth by teſtimonie of Scripture,</p>

                  <hi>Which the holy Ghoſt foretolde.</hi> Such maner of ſpeeches bring greater reuerence to the ſcriptures, whiles wee are taught by them, that Dauid and all the reſt of the prophetes did ſpeake only as they were directed by the holy Ghoſte: ſo that they them ſelues were not the authours of their propheſies, but the Spirite which vſed their tongues as an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Wherefore ſeeing that our dulneſſe is ſo great, that wee aſcribe leſſe authoritie vnto the ſcriptures than wee ought: wee muſt diligently note ſuch manner of ſpeaches, &amp; acquaint our ſelues with them, that we may oftentimes remember the authoritie of God to confirme our faith withall.</p>
               <p n="17">17 <hi>Adopted.</hi> It is worde for word Reckoned.

Surely it was a thing which might make them greatly amaſed, that he whom Chriſt had extolled vnto ſo high dignitie, ſhould fall headlong into ſuch deſtruction. Which circumſtance doeth increaſe the crueltie of the fact, and teacheth the reſt to take heed vnto themſelues. Neither is it to be doubted, but that the diſciples did remember Iudas with great griefe and ſorrow. But Peter doth here expreſſe by name the excellencie of his function, that he might make them more attentiue &amp; more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to prouide a remedie.</p>
               <p n="18">18 <hi>And he truly.</hi> It ſeemeth vnto mee a thing like to bee true, that this narration of the death of Iudas was put in by Luke: therefore it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med good to me to include it within a Parentheſis, that it may be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from Peter his Sermon. For to what ende ſhoulde Peter heere reckon vp vnto the Diſciples thoſe thinges which they alreadie knew well enough?</p>
               <p>Secondly, it ſhould haue been an abſurd thing to haue ſpoken after this among them, that the field which was bought with the money that was giuen to betray Chriſte, was called of the Hebrewes in their owne mother tongue <hi>Acheldima.</hi> But whereas ſome doe anſwere that Peter ſpoke this vnto the Galileans, whoſe ſpeech did diſagree with the Iewiſh tongue, it is but vaine and friuolous.

               <p>Furthermore howe coulde this bee a fit worde for Ieruſalem, where Peter made his ſermon? To what end ſhould hee interprete in Greeke among the Hebrewes, their owne mother tongue?

But Luke his meaning was, that his buriall with the perpetuall note of ignominie, was the reward which he had for his falſhood &amp; wicked act, Neither did hee ſo much ſel Chriſt for thirtie pence, as his Apoſtleſhip. Hee enioyed not the money: he only poſſeſſed the fielde. Furthermore it came to paſſe through the marueilous prouidence of god, that the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie common name of the fielde ſhoulde bee a note of infamie for the Prieſtes, which had bought the innocent blood, of the Traitor. Hee ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that the Hebrewes did call it by that name in their tongue, becauſe hee himſelfe was a Grecian borne; And hee calleth that the Hebrewe tongue, which the Iewes did vſe after the captiuitie of Babylon, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, ſuche as was mixed of the Aſſyrians tongue and of the Chalde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans tongue.</p>

Secondly, it ſeemeth that Peter doeth applie theſe thinges a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe vnto Iudas, which were ſpoken of the enemies of Dauid. I anſwere that Dauid doth there ſpeake after this ſort of him ſelfe, that hee may deſcribe the condition and ſtate of Chriſte his kingdome.</p>
               <p>In that Pſalme (I ſay) is contained the common image of the whole church, which is the bodie of the Sonne of God. Therfore the things which are there ſet down muſt needes haue been fulfilled in the head, which are indeed fulfilled, as the Euangeliſts do teſtifie. Now if any man obiect that thoſe things which ther were ſpoken againſt the enemies of Dauid, do not fitly agree vnto Iudas: we may eaſily gather, that they do ſo much the rather agree with him, bicauſe Dauid doth not reſpect him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe as being ſeparated fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the body of the church: but rather as he was one of the members of Chriſt, and ſo taking vpon him his image, he ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth foorth in his name.</p>
               <p>Whoſoeuer ſhall marke that this ſingular perſon was attributed vnto Dauid, that he ſhould be a figure of Chriſte, will not maruell if all theſe things be applied vnto him, which were prefigured in Dauid. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though therfore he doth comprehend the whole church, yet he begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth at the head thereof, &amp; doth eſpecially deſcribe what things Chriſt ſhould ſuffer by the hands of the wicked. For we learne out of Paule his doctrine, that whatſoeuer afflictions the godlie ſuffer, they are part of the afflictions of Chriſte, and ſerue to the fulfilling of the ſame.<note place="margin">Col. 1.14.</note> This order and connexion did Dauid obſerue, or rather the Spirite of God, who meant by the mouth of Dauid to inſtruct the whole Churche. But as touching the perſecutors of Chriſt, all that which is commonly ſpoken of them, is by good right referred vnto their ſtandard bearer: whoſe impietie and wickedneſſe, as it is moſt famous, ſo his puniſhment ought to be made knowne vnto all men. If anie man doe obiect againe,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:7788:20"/> that that which is recited in the Pſalm, is onely certaine curſings, and not propheſies: and that therefore Peter doth gather improperly that it was of neceſſitie that it ſhould be fulfilled, it is ſoone anſwered. For Dauid was not moued with any peruerſe or corrupt affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the fleſh, to craue vengeance: but he had the holy Spirite to be his guide and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recter. Therefore what things ſoeuer he prayed for there, being inſpired with the holy Ghoſte, they haue the ſame ſtrength which propheſies haue, becauſe the Spirite doth require no other thing than that, which God hath determined with himſelfe to performe, and will alſo promiſe vnto vs. But wheras Peter doth cite out of the ſcriptures two diuers te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies: by the firſt is meant, that Iudas togeather with his name and familie ſhould quite be extinguiſhed, that his place might be emptie: the other, which he fetcheth out of the hundreth &amp; ninth Pſalme, tendeth to this end, that ther ſhuld be an other choſen to ſupply his place. Theſe ſeem at the firſt to be contrarie: namely, a waſte habitation and ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Yet becauſe the Spirite ſaith, only in the former place, that the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries of the Church ſhould bee taken away, that their place might bee emptie, and without one to dwell therein, in reſpect of themſelues: this is no let why another may not afterward ſupply their emptie place. Yea this doth alſo augment their puniſhment, in that the honor, after it is taken from him that was vnworthie thereof, is giuen to another.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And his biſhopricke.</hi> The Hebrewe worde coulde not bee tranſlated more fitly. For <hi>Pecudah</hi> doeth ſignifie a iuriſdiction or gouernment, ſo called of the ouerſeeing, &amp; beholding of things. For as for thoſe which interprete it <hi>Wife,</hi> the text refuteth them. For it followeth in the next verſe, of his wife, That ſhe may be made a widow. Therefore after that he hath wiſhed that the wicked may bee depriued of his life, hee addeth moreouer, that he may be ſpoyled of his honour: neither doth hee ſtay here, but alſo he deſireth that an other may ſucceede him, whereby as I haue ſaid before, his puniſhment is doubled. In the meane while he no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth by the way that this falſe treacher &amp; wicked perſon wherof he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, ſhould not bee ſome one of the common ſort, but ſuch an one as ſhould be indued with honour and dignitie: from which neuertheleſſe he ſhall fall. And out of this place muſt wee learne, that the wicked ſhall not eſcape ſcot free, which haue perſecuted the church of God. For this miſerable and wretched end is prepared for them all.</p>
               <p n="21">21 <hi>We muſt therefore.</hi> This which hee bringeth in, might ſeeme at the firſt ſight to be farre fet. For if ſo be it Dauid did ſpeake of tranſpoſing Iudas his Biſhopricke, it did not thereupon ſtraightway follow that, the diſciples ſhuld chooſe another to be his ſucceſſor: yet becauſe they knew that they had this charge giuen them to order the church, ſo ſoone as Peter had told them, that it did pleaſe the Lord that it ſhould be ſo, hee gathereth thereuppon, that they ought to doe it. For whenſoeuer God will vſe vs as meanes to maintaine the gouernment of his churche, ſo ſoone as wee knowe what his wil is, wee muſt not linger, but ſtoutly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourme whatſoeuer is required in our miniſterie &amp; function. That was without all controuerſie, what was the duetie of the Church. Like
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:7788:20"/> as at this day, when we heare that thoſe muſt bee put from their office which behaue themſelues vngodlilie, and wickedly, and that other muſt be choſen in their roomes, the church muſt take this charge in hande. Wherefore it was ſuperfluous to moue any queſtion about a thing that was not to be doubted of. Therefore let vs alway remember to conſider what we haue to doe, that we may be readie to obey the Lorde. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, when as he intreateth of the making of an Apoſtle, he ſaieth hee muſt be a witneſſe of the reſurrection. Which ſignifieth, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtleſhip is not without the preaching of the Goſpel. Whence it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare howe vaine and friuolous the Popiſhe biſhops are, which hauing on onely dumbe viſors, bragge that they are the ſucceſſors of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. But wherein are they like vnto them? I graunt that Peter doeth here require ſuch a witneſſe, as ſawe the Lorde after his reſurrection, of which ſort Iohn doth profeſſe himſelfe to be one, when he ſayeth,<note place="margin">Iohn. 19.35</note> Hee which ſaw it, beareth witneſſe. For this did ſerue for the confirmation of faith: yet neuertheleſſe Peter maketh it a thing neceſſarie in him and the reſt of his fellowes in office, that they ſhould teach, while hee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them and himſelfe preachers or witneſſes of the reſurrection.</p>
               <p>Hee nameth the reſurrection, not becauſe they muſt beare witneſſe thereof alone: but becauſe firſt vnder this is comprehended the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the death of Chriſte: ſecondly, becauſe wee haue the ende of our redemption therein, and the accompliſhment thereof, and alſo it bringeth with it the celeſtiall gouernment of Chriſte, and the power of the Spirit in defending his, in eſtabliſhing iuſtice &amp; equitie, in reſtoring order, in aboliſhing the tyrannie of ſinne, and in putting to flight all the enemies of the churche.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15.17.</note> Let vs know therefore that thoſe thinges are not excluded by this worde, which are neceſſarilie knit together. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe, let vs note that the reſurrection is heere named before o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thinges, as beeing the chiefe point of the Goſpell, as alſo Paule teacheth.</p>
               <p>But were the Apoſtles alone witneſſes of the reſurrection? Was not this alſo common to the reſt of the diſciples? For Peter ſeemeth to chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge this as proper onely to the Apoſtles. I aunſwere that this title is therfore attributed vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: becauſe they were choſen peculiarlie vnto that function, and becauſe they had the chiefe roume amongeſt thoſe which did bring this ambaſſage: therfore though they were the chief of thoſe which were aſſigned: yet were not they onely appoynted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>All that time.</hi> Hee beginneth at that time when Ieſus beganne to ſhewe himſelfe vnto the worlde. Which is diligently to bee obſerued, as before I haue ſaide. For he liued priuatelie vntill ſuch time as hee was almoſt thirtie yeeres of age. For hee would not make himſelfe knowne further, than was needfull for our ſaluation. Therefore when the time was come wherin he muſt go about that buſineſſe which his Father had appointed him: hee came aborode like a newe man, and one that was but lately borne. Euery man may eaſilie perceiue what great force this
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:7788:21"/> hath to bridle our curioſitie. The whole life of Chriſte might haue beene a mirrour moſt marueilous of more than abſolute perfection: and yet notwithſtanding that hee might keepe vs occupied in the ſtudie &amp; meditation of thoſe things which were moſt needfull to bee knowne, he would leade the better part of his life obſcurelie and in ſecret. Who dare now wander without Chriſt, ſeeing that hee doth applie the knowledge of himſelfe to the edifiyng of faith.</p>

                     <hi>26</hi> And they gaue in their lots, and the lot fell vpon Matthias: and he was by common conſent counted with the eleuen Apostles.</p>
               </q>
               <p n="23">23 They were to chooſe one only into the roome of Iudas: they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent two. Here may a queſtion be asked, Why they were not contented with one onely? Was it becauſe they were ſo like, that they could not diſcerne whether was more fit? This truly had bene no ſufficient rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why they ſhould ſuffer it to be decided by lottes. And alſo it ſeemeth that Ioſeph was of greater eſtimation otherwiſe. Or was it becauſe they were diuerſly affectioned? But this ſemeth ſcarce probable, neither is this to be admitted as true, becauſe of that moſt excellent teſtimony which Luke did giue a little before of their vnity and agreement. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it had beene very abſurde for them to haue polluted the election of the Apoſtle with ſuch ſtrife and contention. But for this cauſe did they vſe the caſting of lots, that it might be knowne that <hi>Matthias</hi> was not onely choſen by the voices of men, but alſo that he was made by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination and iudgement of God.</p>
               <p>For there was this difference between the Apoſtles and the paſtors: that the Paſtors were choſen ſimply by the Church, the Apoſtles were called of God. In which reſpect Paul in the preface of his epiſtle to the Galathians,<note place="margin">Galath. 1.2.</note> doth profeſſe himſelfe to be an Apoſtle, neither of men, neither made by man. Therefore like as the dignitie of this function was excellent: ſo was it meet that in the chooſing of Matthias, the chiefe iudgement ſhould be left vnto God, howſoeuer men did their duetie. Chriſt by his owne mouth did appoint the reſt: therefore if Matthias had bene choſen onely by man, to be one of them, he ſhould haue had leſſe authoritie than they. This was verie orderly done, that the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:7788:21" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſhould preſent vnto God thoſe whom they thought to be the beſt: and he ſhould chooſe to himſelfe whom he knewe to be moſt fit. So that God by the fall of the lot, doth pronounce that he did alow of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtleſhip of Mathias. But the Apoſtles might ſeeme to haue delt very raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly &amp; diſorderly, which laid ſo great and waightie a matter vpon a lot. For what certaintie could they gather thereby? I anſwere, that they did it onely as they were moued thereunto by the holy ſpirite. For although Luke doth not expreſſe this: yet becauſe he will not accuſe the diſciples of raſhnes, but rather doth ſhewe that this election was lawfull and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued of God: I ſay therefore, that they went this way to worke, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mooued by the ſpirite. Like as they were directed in all the action by the ſame Spirit. But whic doe they not praie that God would chooſe whom he would out of the whole multitude? Why do they reſtraine his iudgement vnto two? Is not this to rob God of his libertie, when as they tie him, and as it were make him ſubiect vnto their voices and conſents? But whoſoeuer ſhall quietlie ponder the matter, ſhall plainlie perceiue by the drift of Luke, that the diſciples durſt do nothing, but that which they knew was their dutie to doe, &amp; was commanded them by the Lord. As for the contentions, let them goe ſhake their eares.</p>
               <p n="24">24 <hi>In praying they ſaid.</hi> Word for word it is, Hauing praied, they ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But there is no obſcuritie in the ſenſe: becauſe his meaning was to ſpeake as followeth, that they prayed. And yet hee doth not reckon vp all the wordes, being content briefly to ſhew the ſumme. Therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they were both of honeſt conuerſation, yea although they did excell in holineſſe and other vertues: yet becauſe the integritie of the heart, whereof God is the alone knower and iudge, is the chiefe, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples pray, that God would bring that to light which was hidden from men. The ſame ought to bee required euen at this day in chooſing Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours. For howſoeuer we are not to appoint two for one, yet becauſe we may oftentimes be deceiued, &amp; the diſcerning of ſpirites co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth of the Lorde, we muſt alwayes pray vnto God, that he will ſhewe vnto vs what men he will haue to be miniſters, that hee may direct and gouerne our purpoſes. Here we may alſo gather what great regard wee muſt haue of integritie &amp; innocencie in chooſing Paſtours, without which both lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and eloquence, &amp; what excellencie ſoeuer can bee inuented, are as nothing.</p>
               <p n="26">26 <hi>They gaue in their lots.</hi> We wil not in this place make any long diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation about lots. Thoſe men who thinke it to be wickedneſſe to caſt lots at al, offend partly through ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, &amp; partly they vnderſtand not the force of this word. There is nothing which men do not corrupt with their boldnes and vanitie. Whereby it is come to paſſe that they haue brought lots into great abuſe and ſuperſtition. For that diuination or coniecture which is made by lots, is altogether diueliſh. But when magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates deuide prouinces amongſt them, &amp; brethren their inheritance, it is a thing lawfull. Which thing Solomon doth plainely teſtifie, when he maketh God the gouernour of the euent. The lots (ſaith he) are caſt into the boſome,<note place="margin">Pro. 16.33.</note> and the iudgement of them commeth foorth from the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:7788:22" rendition="simple:additions"/> Lord. This ordinance or cuſtome is no more corrupt &amp; depraued by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, than the corrupt vanitie of the Chaldeans doth corrupt true &amp; naturall Aſtrologie. Whileſt the Chaldeans go about with the name of Aſtrologie to cloake and colour their wicked curioſitie, they defame a ſcience both profitable and praiſeworthie. The ſame do thoſe which tel men their deſtinies (as they call them) by caſting lots: but it is our due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to diſcerne the lawfull vſe from the corruption. Hee ſaieth the lots were giuen, that being put into a pot, or one of their lappes, they might afterward be drawen out. And heere we muſt alſo note that this worde Lot is diuerſly taken in this place. For when he ſaide before, that Iudas had obtained a lot of the miniſterie, his meaning was (according to the common cuſtome of the ſcripture) that hee had a portion giuen him of the Lord. Hee ſpeaketh afterward properlie and without any figure of a lot. Yet is it likely, for as much as the worde <hi>Goral</hi> is commonly vſed by the Hebrewes for both thinges, that Peter meant to allude vnto that which they were about to doe: and that Luke had reſpect vnto the ſelfe ſame thing,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of the ministerie and Apostleſhip.</hi> Becauſe the word Miniſtery was baſe, he addeth Apoſtleſhip, wherein there is greater dignitie. Although the ſenſe ſhall be more plaine if you expound it, The miniſterie of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtleſhip. For the figure Hypallage is common in the Scriptures. Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly Luke meant to ioyne with the burden, the excellencie of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, that it might haue the greater reuerence and authoritie: and yet this was his intent alſo, to declare that the Apoſtles are called vnto a painefull function.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The lot fell vpon Matthias.</hi> It came to paſſe as no man would haue loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for: for we may gather by that which goeth before, that there was not ſo great account made of Matthias, as of the other: For beſides that Luke gaue him the former place, the two ſirnames which Barſabas had, do ſhew that he was in great eſtimation. Hee was called Barſabas, that is the ſonne of an oath, or of reſt, of the thing it ſelfe, as if he were ſome mirror either of faithfulneſſe and innocencie, or of a quiet and modeſt nature. The other ſirname did import ſingular honeſty. This man there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in mens iudgement was the former: but God did preferre Matthias before him. Whereby we are taught, that we muſt not glory if we be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolled vnto the skies in the opinion of men, &amp; if by their voices &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, we be iudged to be moſt excellent men: but we muſt rather haue regard of this, to approue our ſelues vnto God, who alone is the moſt lawfull and iuſt iudge, by whoſe ſentence and iudgement wee ſtande or fall. And we may oftentimes marke this alſo: that God paſſeth ouer him which is the chiefeſt in the ſight of men, that hee may throw downe all pride which is in man. In that he addeth, that he was reckoned amongſt the reſt, he wipeth away all ſiniſter note of raſhnes from the caſting of lots: becauſe the Church did embrace him as choſen by God, on whom the lot fell.</p>

               <p n="2">2 <hi>And there was made.</hi> It was requiſite that the gift ſhoulde be viſible, that the bodily ſenſe might the more ſtirre vp the diſciples.

This was therefore a preparation that they might the better know that the Spirit was nowe

For both Chriſt himſelf, when he was about to giue the Spirit to his Apoſtles, did breath vpon them. And in Ezechiel his viſion there was a whirlewind &amp; wind. Yea, the word Spirit it ſelfe is a tranſlated worde: For, becauſe that hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtacie or perſon of the diuine eſſence, which is called the Spirit, is of it ſelfe incomprehenſible, the ſcripture doeth borrowe the worde of the winde or blaſt: becauſe it is the power of God, which God doth powre into all creatures,<note place="margin">Iohn. 1.32.</note> as it were by breathing. The ſhape of tongues is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained vnto the preſent circumſtance. For as the figure and ſhape of a Doue which came downe vpon Chriſt, had a ſignification agreeable to the office and nature of Chriſt: ſo God did nowe make choiſe of a ſigne which might be agreeable to the thing ſignified: namelie, that it might ſhew ſuch effect and working of the holy Ghoſt in the Apoſtles, as followed afterward. The diuerſity of tongues did hinder the goſpel from being ſpred abroad any farther. So that if the preachers of the Goſpel had ſpoken one language onely, al men would haue thought that Chriſt had beene ſhut vp in the ſmall corner of Iurie: but God inuented a waie whereby it might breake out, when he diuided and cloue the tongues of the Apoſtles, that they might ſpread that abroad amongſt all people, which was deliuered to them. Wherein appeareth the manifolde good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of God:<note place="margin">Gene. 11.7.</note> becauſe a plague and puniſhment of mans pride was turned into matter of bleſſing. For whence came the diuerſitie of tongues, ſaue onelie that the wicked and vngodly counſels of men might be brought to nought? But God doeth furniſh the Apoſtles with the diuerſitie of tongues nowe,<note place="margin">Eſai. 19.18. Rom. 15.6.</note> that hee may bring and call home into a bleſſed vnitie, men which wander here and there. Theſe clouen tongues made al men to ſpeake the language of Canaan: as Iſaias foretold. For what language ſoeuer they ſpeake, yet doe they call vpon one Father, which is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, with one mouth and one ſpirite. I ſaide that that was done for our ſake, not onely becauſe the fruit came vnto vs, but becauſe we know that the Goſpel came not vnto vs by chaunce, but by the appointment of God, who to this end gaue the Apoſtles clouen tongues, leaſt anie nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:7788:23"/> ſhould want that doctrine which was committed vnto them. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by is prooued the calling of the Gentiles: and ſecondly heereby their doctrine doth purchaſe credite, which we know was not forged by man, ſeeing that we heare that the Spirite did dwell in their tongues. Now it remaineth that we declare what the <hi>fire</hi> meaneth. Without all doubt it was a token of the force and efficacie, which ſhould be exerciſed in the voice of the Apoſtles. Otherwiſe, although their ſounde had gone out into the vttermoſt parts of the world, they ſhould only haue but the aire without doing any good at all. Therefore the Lord doth ſhew that their voice ſhalbe firie, that it may enflame the hearts of men: that the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the world being burnt and conſumed, it may purge and renew all things. Otherwiſe they durſt neuer haue taken vppon them ſo hard<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Heereby it came to paſſe, that the doctrine of the Goſpel did not onely ſounde in the aire, but pearce into the minds of men, and did fill them with an heauenly heat and burning. Neither was this force ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only in the mouth of the Apoſtles, but it appeareth daily. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt beware leaſt when the fire burneth, wee be as ſtubble. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore the Lorde did once giue the holy Ghoſt vnder a viſible ſhape, that we may aſſure our ſelues, that his inuiſible and hidden grace ſhall neuer be wanting to the Church.</p>

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:7788:24"/> Therefore they thinke that one and the ſame ſound of the voice was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſly diſtributed amongſt the hearers. An other coniecture they haue, becauſe Peter made one ſermon in the audience of many gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither out of diuers countries: who could not vnderſtand his ſpeech and language, vnleſſe an other voice ſhould come vnto their eares, then that which proceeded out of his mouth. But we muſt firſt note, that the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples ſpake in deede with ſtrange tongues: otherwiſe the miracle had not bene wrought in them, but in the hearers. So that the ſimilitude ſhould haue bene falſe, whereof he made mention before: neither ſhoulde the Spirit haue bene giuen ſo much to them as to others. Againe, we heare how Paul giueth thanks to God,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 14.18</note> that he ſpeaketh with diuers tongues. Truely he chalengeth to himſelfe both the vnderſtanding, and alſo the vſe thereof. Neither did he attaine to this skil by his owne ſtudy and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrie, but he had it by the gift of the Spirit. In the ſame place he affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, that it is an eſpecial gift, wherewith all men are not indued. I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that it doth manifeſtly appeare hereby, that the Apoſtles had the varietie &amp; vnderſtanding of tongues giuen them: that they might ſpeak vnto the Greeks in Greeke, vnto the Italians in the Italian tongue, and that they might haue true communication and conference with their hearers. Notwithſtanding I leaue it indifferent, whether there was any ſecond miracle wrought or no, ſo that the Aegyptians and Elamites did vnderſtand Peter ſpeaking in the Chaldean tongue, as if he did vtter di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers voices. For there be ſome coniectures which perſwade me thus to thinke, and yet not ſo firme, but that they may be refuted. For it may be that they ſpake with diuers tongs, as they light vppon this man or that, and as occaſion was offered, &amp; as their languages were diuers. Therfore it was a manifeſt miracle, when they ſaw them readie to ſpeake diuerſe languages. As touching Peter his ſermon, it might be vnderſtood of the more part of men whereſoeuer they were borne: For it is to be thought that many of thoſe which came to Ieruſalem were skilful in the Chalde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an tongue. Again, it ſhalbe nothing inconuenient, if we ſay that he ſpake alſo in other tongues. Although I will not much ſtand about this matter ſo that this be out of doubt, that the Apoſtles changed their ſpeech.</p>

Furthermore he meant to cite thoſe as witneſſes, which may the better be beleeued for their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and godlineſſe. When he ſaid, <hi>out of euerie nation,</hi> he meaneth out of diuerſe Countries, whereof one is farre from another. For he doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo afterwarde reckon vp thoſe lands whereof one was farre diſtant from another, of which ſort are Lybia and Pontus, Rome and Parthia, and Arabia and ſuch like. This ſerueth to encreaſe the greatneſſe of the thing.

Yea, this was alſo a worke of God worthie to be remembred, and wondered at, that in ſo huge and horrible a ſcattering abroade of the people, hee did alwayes reſerue ſome reliques, yea he cauſed certaine ſtraungers to adioyne themſelues vnto a people which was in ſuch miſerie and as it were quite deſtroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

Neither doth he call them vnaduiſedly and without good conſideration godly men and men fearing God.</p>
               <p n="6">6 <hi>When this was noyſed abroad.</hi> Luke ſaith thus in Greeke, This voice being made, but his meaning is that the fame was ſpread abroad, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it came to paſſe that a great multitude came togither. For if one after another in diuerſe places, and at diuerſe times had heard the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles ſpeaking in diuerſe tongues, the miracle had not beene ſo famous. Therefore they come all togither into one place, that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie of tongues may the better appeare by the preſent compariſon. There is a further circumſtance alſo heere to bee noted, that the Countrie and natiue foyle of the Apoſtles was commonly knowne, and this was alſo commonlie knowne that they neuer went out of their Countrie, to learne ſtraunge tongues. Therefore foraſmuch as one ſpeaketh Latine, another Greeke, another the Arabian tongue, as occaſion was offered, and that indifferentlie, and euerie one doth alſo
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:7788:25"/> chaunge his tongue, the worke of God appeareth more plainelie here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.</p>
               <p n="11">11 <hi>The wonderfull workes of God.</hi> Luke noteth two things which cauſed the hearers to wonder: firſt, becauſe the Apoſtles being before ignorant and priuate perſons, borne in a baſe corner, did notwithſtanding intreat profoundly of diuine matters, and of heauenly wiſedome. The other is, becauſe they haue new tongues giuen them ſodainly. Both thinges are worth the noting, becauſe to huddle out words vnaduiſedly and fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſhould not ſo much haue ſerued to moue their minds, &amp; the maieſtie of the things ought the more to haue mooued them to conſider the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle. Although they giue due honor to God, in that that they are aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied and amaſed: yet the principall fruite of the miracle is expreſſed, in this that they enquire: and thereby declare that they are prepared to learne: for otherwiſe their amaſednes and wondering ſhould not haue done them any great good. And certainely wee muſt ſo wonder at the workes of God, that there muſt bee alſo a conſideration, and a deſire to vnderſtand.</p>
               <p n="12">12 <hi>Others mocking.</hi> Hereby it appeareth howe monſtrous as well the ſluggiſhnes, as alſo the vngodlines of men is, when Satan hath taken away their minde. If God ſhould openly and viſiblie deſcend from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, his maieſtie could ſcarce more manifeſtly appeare, than in this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle. Whoſoeuer hath any drop of ſound vnderſtanding in him, muſt needs be ſtriken with the onely hearing of it. How beaſtly then are thoſe men, who ſee it with their eies, and yet ſcoffe? and goe about with their ieſts to mocke the power of God? But the matter is ſo. There is nothing ſo wonderfull, which thoſe men do not turne to a ieſt, who are touched with no care of God: becauſe they doe euen vppon ſet purpoſe, harden themſelues in their ignorance, in thinges moſt plaine. And it is a iuſt puniſhment of God, which he bringeth vpon ſuch pride: to deliuer them to Satan to be driuen headlong into blind furie. Wherefore there is no cauſe why we ſhould marueile, that there be ſo many at this day ſo blind in ſo great light, if they be ſo deafe when ſuch manifeſt doctrine is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, yea if they wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tonly refuſe ſaluation when it is offered vnto them. For if the wonderfull and ſtrange workes of God wherein he doth won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully ſet forth his power, be ſubiect to the mockes of men: what ſhall become of doctrine, which they thinke taſteth of nothing, but of that which is common? Although Luke doth ſignifie vnto vs that they were not of the worſt ſort, or altogither paſt hope, which did laugh &amp; mocke: but he meant rather to declare how the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon ſort was affected when they ſaw this miracle. And truely it hath bene alwaies ſo in the worlde, for verie fewe haue bene touched with the true feeling of God, as often as he hath reuealed himſelfe. Neither is it any maruel: for religion is a rare vertue, and a vertue which few men haue: which is in deede the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of vnderſtanding. Neuertheleſſe howſoeuer the more part of men through a certaine hard ſtifneckednes, doth reiect the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the works of God, yet are they neuer without frute.

The ſumme of this Sermon is this: hee gathereth that Chriſt is already reuealed and giuen by the gifte of the holy Ghoſt, which they ſawe. Yet firſt hee refuteth that falſe opinon, in that they thought that the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples were drunke. This refutation conſiſteth vpon a probable argument: becauſe men vſe not to bee drunke betimes in the morning. For as Paule ſaieth, Thoſe which are drunke, are drunke in the night.<note place="margin">1. Theſ. 5.6.</note> For they flie the light for ſhame. And ſurely ſo great is the filthineſſe of this vice, that for good cauſes it hateth the light. And yet this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument were not alwayes good. For Ieſaias doeth inueigh in his time againſt thoſe, which did riſe earlie to followe drunkenneſſe. And at this day there be manie, who like hogges, ſo ſoone as they awake, runne to quaffing. But becauſe this is a common cuſtome amongeſt men, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſaieth, that it is no likelie thing. Thoſe which haue but euen ſmall skill in antiquitie, doe knowe that the ciuill day, from the riſing of the Sunne vntill the going downe thereof, was diuided into twelue houres. So that the houres were longer in ſommer, and ſhorter in winter. Therefore that which ſhoulde nowe be the ninth before noone in win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and in ſomer the eight, was the thirde houre amongſt the olde people. Therefore, whereas Peter doeth onely lightlie remooue the opinion of drunkenneſſe, hee doeth it for this cauſe, becauſe it had beene ſuperfluous to haue ſtoode about any long excuſe. Therefore, as in a matter which was certaine and out of doubt, hee doeth rather pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie thoſe which mocked, than labour to teach them. And hee doeth not ſo much refute them by the circumſtance of time, as by the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of Ioel. For when hee ſaieth that that is nowe come to paſſe, which was foretolde, hee toucheth briefely their vnthankefulneſſe,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:7788:26" rendition="simple:additions"/> becauſe they doe not acknowledge ſuch an excellent benefite promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vnto them in times paſt, which they nowe ſee with their eyes.

               <p n="17">17 <hi>It ſhall be in the last dayes.</hi> By this effect he prooueth that the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias is alreadie reuealed.<note place="margin">Ioel. 2.29.</note> Ioel in deede doth not expreſſe the laſt dayes: but for as much as he entreateth of the perfect reſtoring of the Church, it is not to bee doubted but that that prophecie belongeth vnto the laſt age alone. Wherefore that which Peter bringeth, doeth no whit diſſent from Ioel his meaning: but he doth onely adde this word for expoſitions ſake, that the Iewes might knowe, that the Church could by no other meanes be reſtored, which was then decayed, but by being renewed by the Spirit of God. Againe, becauſe the repairing of the Church, ſhould be like vnto a new world, therefore Peter ſaieth that it ſhall bee in the laſt dayes. And ſurelie this was a common and familiar thing among the Iewes, that all thoſe great promiſes concerning the bleſſed and well ordered ſtate of the Church, ſhoulde not bee fulfilled, vntill Chriſt by his comming ſhoulde reſtore all thinges. Wherefore it was out of all doubt amongſt them, that that which is cited out of Ioel, doth apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnto the laſt time.

Therefore for as much as they did all hope, that the reſtoring drewe neere, hee accuſeth them of ſluggiſhneſſe, becauſe they doe not once thinke vppon the way, and meanes thereof. And when the Prophet ſaith, I wil powre out, it is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all queſtion, that he meant by this worde to note the great aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the Spirite. And we muſt take, <hi>I will powre out of my Spirite,</hi> in the ſame ſenſe, as if he had ſaide ſimplie, I will powre out my Spirite. For theſe latter wordes, are the wordes of the Prophet.

And hence doe wee gather a profitable doctrine, that wee can haue no more excellent thing giuen vs of God than the grace of the Spirite: yea that all other thinges are nothing woorth, if this bee wanting. For when God will briefelie promiſe ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:7788:26" rendition="simple:additions"/> to his people, hee affirmeth that hee will giue them his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite. Hereupon it followeth that we can obtaine no good thinges, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till we haue the Spirit giuen vs. And truely it is as it were the key, which openeth vnto vs the doore, that we may enter into all the treaſures of ſpirituall good thinges: and that wee may alſo haue entrance into the kingdome of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vppon all fleſh.</hi> It appeareth by that which followeth, of what force this generalitie is. For firſt it is ſet downe generallie, All fleſh: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that the partition is added, whereby the Prophet doeth ſignifie that there ſhalbe no difference of age or kinde, but that God admitteth al, one with another vnto the partaking of his grace. It is ſaid therefore <hi>All fleſhe,</hi> becauſe both younge and olde, men and women, are thereby ſignified. Yet heere may a queſtion be mooued, why God doth promiſe that vnto his people, as ſome newe and vnwoonted good thing, which hee was woont to do for them from the beginning throughout all ages. For there was no age voide of the grace of the Spirite. The aunſwere of this queſtion is ſet downe in theſe two woordes, I will powre out, and, Vppon all fleſhe. For wee muſt heere note a double contrarietie betweene the time of the olde, and newe Teſtament. For the powring out (as I haue ſaide) doeth ſignifie great plentie: when as there was vnder the Lawe a more ſcarce diſtribution. For which cauſe Iohn alſo doeth ſay that the holy Ghoſt was not giuen vntill Chriſt aſcended in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to heauen. <hi>All fleſhe</hi> doeth ſignifie an infinite multitude, where as God in times paſt did vouchſafe to beſtowe ſuch plentie of his ſpirite onely vpon a few.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, in both compariſons wee doe not denie but that the Fathers vnder the Lawe, were partakers of the ſelfeſame grace whereof wee are partakers: but the Lorde doeth ſhewe that wee are aboue them, as wee are in deede. I ſay, that all Godly men ſithence the beginning of the worlde, were endewed with the ſame ſpirite of vnderſtanding, of righteouſneſſe, and ſanctification, wherewith the Lorde doeth at this daie illuminate and regenerate vs: but there were but a fewe which had the light of knowledge giuen them then, if they bee compared with the great multitude of the faithfull, which Chriſt did ſodainlie gather togithe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> by his comming. Againe, their knowledge was but obſcure and ſlender, and as it were couered with a veile, if it bee compared with that which wee haue at this daie out of the Goſpell, where Chriſt the Sunne of righteouſneſſe doeth ſhine with perfect brightneſſe, as it were at noone daie. Neither doeth that anie whitte hurt or hinder, that a fewe had ſuch an excellent faith, that peraduenture they haue no equall at this day. For their vnderſtanding did neuertheleſſe ſmell, or ſauour of the inſtruction and Schoolemaſterſhippe of the Lawe. For that is alwayes true, that god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie kings and Prophetes haue not ſeene, nor hearde thoſe things which Chriſt hath reuealed by his comming. Therefore to the end the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Ioel may commende the excellencie of the newe Teſtament, he
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:7788:27"/> affirmeth and foretelleth that the grace of the Spirite ſhall bee more plentifull in time thereof:<note place="margin">Mat. 13.17. Luke 10.24.</note> and againe, that it ſhall come vnto moe men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And your ſonnes ſhall prophecie.</hi> By the worde Prophecie, hee meant to note the rare and ſingular gifte of vnderſtanding. And to the ſame purpoſe tendeth that partition which followeth afterwarde: <hi>your young men</hi> ſhall ſee viſions, and your olde men ſhall dreame dreames. For we gather out of the twelfth Chapter of Numbers, that theſe were the two ordinary wayes whereby God did reueale himſelfe to the prophets. For in that place when the Lorde exempteth Moſes from the common ſort of Prophetes,<note place="margin">Num. 12.6.</note> he ſaieth: I appeare vnto my ſeruants by a viſion, or by a dreame: but I ſpeake vnto Moſes face to face. Therefore wee ſee that two kindes are put after the generall worde, for a confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Yet this is the ſumme, that they ſhall all bee Prophetes ſo ſoone as the holie Ghoſt ſhall bee powred out from heauen. But here it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected, that there was no ſuch thing, euen in the Apoſtles themſelues, neither yet in the whole multitude of the faithfull. I anſwere, that the prophets did commonly vſe to ſhadowe vnder tropes moſt fit for their time, the kingdome of Chriſt. When they ſpeake of the worſhippe of God, they name the Altar, the Sacrifices, the offering of golde, ſiluer, and frankenſence. Notwithſtanding we know that the Altars do ceaſe, the Sacrifices are aboliſhed, whereof there was ſome vſe in time of the Lawe: and that the Lorde requireth ſome higher thing at our handes, than earthlie riches. That is true in deede. but the Prophetes, whiles they applie their ſtyle vnto the capacitie of their time, comprehende vnder figures (wherewith the people were then well acquainted) thoſe thinges, which wee ſee otherwiſe reuealed and ſhewed nowe, like as when hee promiſeth elſe where,<note place="margin">Iſaie. 66.21.</note> that hee will make Prieſtes of Leuites, and Leuites of the common ſort of men: this is his meaning, that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the kingdome of Chriſt euerie baſe perſon ſhall be extolled vnto an honorable eſtate. Therefore if wee deſire to haue the true and naturall meaning of this place, we muſt not vrge the words which are taken out of the olde order of the Lawe: but wee muſt onely ſeeke the truth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out figures. And that is it, that the Apoſtles through the ſodaine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration of the Spirite, did intreat of the heauenly myſteries. <hi>Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticallie,</hi> that is to ſaie, diuinelie and aboue the common order. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this worde Prophecie doeth ſignifie nothing elſe, ſaue onelie the rare and excellent gifte of vnderſtanding: as if Ioel ſhoulde ſay, Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the kingdome of Chriſt there ſhall not bee a fewe Prophetes onelie, vnto whome GOD may reueale his ſecretes: but all men ſhall bee endewed with ſpirituall wiſedome, euen to the propheticall excellencie. As it is alſo in Ieremie: Euery man ſhall no longer teach his neighbour,<note place="margin">Iere. 13.34.</note> becauſe they ſhall all knowe mee from the leaſt vnto the greateſt. And in theſe wordes Peter inuiteth the Iewes, vnto whom hee ſpeaketh, to bee partakers of the ſame grace. As if he ſhoulde ſaie, The Lorde is r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>adie to powre out that Spirit farre and wide, which hee hath powred vppon vs. Therefore, vnleſſe you your ſelues bee the cauſe
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:7788:27"/> of let, yee ſhall receiue with vs of this fulnes. And as for vs, let vs know that the ſame is ſpoken to vs at this day, which was then ſpoken to the Iewes. For although thoſe viſible graces of the Spirit be ceaſed, yet God hath not withdrawne his Spirit from his Church. Wherefore he offereth him daily vnto vs all, by this ſame promiſe, without putting any diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. Wherefore we are poore and needie onely through our owne ſluggiſhnes: and alſo it appeareth manifeſtly that thoſe are wicked and ſacrilegious enimies of the Spirite, which keepe backe the Chriſtian common people from the knowledge of God, and for as much as hee himſelfe doth not onely admit, but alſo call by name vnto himſelfe wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and men, yonge and old.</p>
               <p n="18">18 <hi>Vpon my ſeruants.</hi> In theſe words the promiſe is reſtrained vnto the worſhipers of God. For God doth not prophane his Spirite: which hee ſhould do, if he ſhould make the ſame common to the vnbeleeuing and deſpiſers. It is cetaine that we are made the ſeruants of God by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite: and that therefore we are not, vntill ſuch time as we haue receiued the ſame: but firſt, whom God hath adopted to bee of his familie, and whom he hath framed by his Spirite to obey him, thoſe doth he furniſh with new giftes afterward. Againe the Prophet did not reſpect that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of time, but his meaning was to make this grace proper to the Church alone. And for as much as the Church was onely among the Iewes, he calleth them honorablie the ſeruants and handmaids of God. But, after that God did gather vnto himſelf on euery ſide a Church, the wall of ſeparation being pulled downe, ſo many as are receiued into the ſocietie of the couenant, are called by the ſame name. Onely let vs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that the Spirit is appointed for the Church properly.</p>
               <p n="19">19 <hi>And I will ſhew wonders.</hi> Wee muſt firſt ſee what is meant by this great day of the Lorde. Some do expound it of the former comming of Chriſt in the fleſh: and otherſome referre it vnto the laſt day of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection: I doe allowe neither opinion. For in my iudgement the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet comprehendeth the whole kingdome of Chriſt. And ſo he calleth it the Great day, after that the ſonne of God began to be reuealed in the fleſh, that he may lead vs into the fulfilling of his kingdome. Therefore hee appointeth no certaine day, but hee beginneth this day at the firſt preaching of the Goſpel, and he extendeth the ſame vnto the laſt reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. Thoſe which reſtraine it vnto the time of the Apoſtles, are mooued with this reaſon: becauſe the Prophet ioyneth this member, and that which goeth next before togither. But in that, there is no ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurditie at all, becauſe the Prophet doeth aſſigne the time, when theſe thinges beganne to come to paſſe, howſoeuer they haue a continuall going forwarde euen vntill the ende of the world. Furthermore where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he ſaith that the ſunne ſhall be turned to darkeneſſe, and the moone into blood, they are figuratiue ſpeeches, whereby he doth giue vs to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand thus much, that the Lord wil ſhew tokens of his wrath through out the whole frame of the worlde, which ſhall bring men euen to their wits ende, as if there ſhoulde bee ſome horrible and fearefull chaunge of nature wrought. For as the ſunne and moone are vnto vs wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:7788:28"/> of Gods fatherlie fauour towards vs, whiles that by courſe they giue light to the earth: ſo on the otherſide, the Prophet ſaith that they ſhall bee meſſengers to foreſhewe Gods wrath and diſpleaſure. And this is the ſeconde member of the prophecie. For after that hee had intreated of the ſpirituall grace which ſhoulde bee aboundantlie pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out vppon all fleſh: leaſt any man ſhoulde imagine that all thinges ſhoulde bee quiet and proſperous togither, therewithall hee addeth, that the eſtate of the worlde ſhall bee troubleſome, and full of greate feare vnder Chriſt. As Chriſt himſelfe doeth more fully declare, Math. 24. and Luke 21. But this ſerueth greatlie to the ſetting foorth of grace, that where as all thinges doe threaten deſtruction, yet who ſo euer doeth call vppon the name of the Lorde, is ſure to be ſaued. By the darkeneſſe of the Sunne, by the bloodie ſtreaming of the Moone, by the blacke vapour of ſmoke, the Prophet meant to declare, that whither ſo euer men turne their eyes, there ſhall manie thinges ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare both vpwarde and downewarde, which maie make them ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and afraide, as hee hath alreadie ſaide. Therefore this is as much as if hee ſhoulde haue ſaide, that the worlde was neuer in a more mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable caſe, that there were neuer ſo manie and ſuch cruell tokens of Gods wrath. Hence may wee gather howe vneſtimable the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God is, who offereth a preſent remedie for ſo great euils: and againe, howe vnthankefull they are towardes God, and howe fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde, which doe not flie vnto the ſanctuarie of ſaluation, which is nigh vnto them; and doeth meete them. Againe, it is out of all doubt that God meaneth by this ſo dolefull a deſcription, to ſtirre vp all Godlie men, that they may with a more feruent deſire ſeeke for ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. And Peter citeth it to the ſame ende: that the Iewes maie knowe that they ſhall bee more than miſerable, vnleſſe they receiue that grace of the Spirite which is offered vnto them. Yet heere may a queſtion bee asked howe this can hange togither, that when Chriſt is reuealed, there ſhoulde ſuch a ſea of miſeries ouerflowe and breake out therewithall. For it may ſeeme to be a thing verie inconuenient, that hee ſhoulde bee the onely pledge of Gods loue toward mankinde, in whom the heauenlie father doeth lay open all the treaſure of his goodneſſe: yea he powreth out the bowels of his mercie vppon vs, and that yet by the comming of the ſame his ſonne, his wrath ſhoulde bee more whot than it was woont, ſo that it ſhould as it were quite conſume both heauen and earth at once. But we muſt firſt marke, that becauſe men are too ſlowe to receiue Chriſt, they muſt bee conſtrained by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe afflictions, as it were with whippes. Secondly, for as much as Chriſt doeth call vnto himſelfe all thoſe which are heauie loden and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,<note place="margin">Mat. 11.24.</note> wee muſt firſt bee tamed by manie miſeries, that wee may learne humilitie. For through great proſperitie, men doe ſet vp the hornes of pride. And hee cannot but deſpiſe Chriſt fiercelie, who ſo euer hee be, that ſeemeth to himſelfe to bee happie. Thirdly becauſe wee are more than we ought, ſet vpon the ſeeking of the peace of the fleſh: whereby it commeth alſo to paſſe, that manie tye the grace of Chriſt vnto the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:7788:28"/> life, it is expedient for vs to be accuſtomed to thinke otherwiſe, that we may knowe that the kingdome of Chriſt is ſpiritual. Therefore to the ende God may teach vs that the good things of Chriſt are heauenly, he doth exerciſe vs according to the fleſh, with manie miſeries. Whereby it commeth to paſſe that we do ſeeke our felicity without the world. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer men doe bring miſeries vppon themſelues through their vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe. For the ſeruant which knoweth his maſters will,<note place="margin">Luk. 12.47.</note> and doeth not obey, is worthy of greater &amp; more ſtripes: The more familiarly that God doeth communicate with vs in Chriſt, the more doth our vngodlineſſe growe and breake out into open contumacie: ſo that it is no maruell if when Chriſt reuealed, there appeare manie tokens of Gods vengeance on the other ſide, for as much as me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do hereby more grieuouſly prouoke God againſt them, &amp; kindle his wrath through wicked contempt. Surely in that the day of Chriſt is fearefull, it is an accidental thing, whether God will correct our ſlouthfulnes, to bring vs vnder which are yet vnapt to be taught: or whether he wil puniſh our vnthankfulnes. For it bringeth with it of it ſelfe, nothing but that which is pleaſant. But the contempt of Gods grace doeth prouoke him to horrible anger not without cauſe.</p>
               <p n="21">21 <hi>Who ſo euer ſhall call vpon.</hi> An excellent place. For as God doeth prick vs forward like ſluggiſh Aſſes, with threatnings &amp; terrors, to ſeeke ſaluation: ſo, after that he hath brought darknes vpon the face of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and earth, yet doth he ſhew a meanes whereby ſaluation may ſhine before our eyes: to wit, if we ſhall call vpon him. For we muſt diligentlie note this circumſtance. If God ſhould promiſe ſaluation ſimplie, it were a great matter: but it is a far greater, when as he promiſeth the ſame a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt manifold dungeons of death. Whiles that (ſaith he) all things ſhal be out of order, and the feare of deſtruction ſhal poſſeſſe al things, onely call vpon me and yee ſhall be ſaued. Therefore howſoeuer man be ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed vp in the goulfe of miſeries, yet is there ſet before him a way to eſcape. We muſt alſo note the vniuerſall worde, <hi>who ſo euer.</hi> For God ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth all men vnto himſelfe without exception, and by this meanes doth he inuite them to ſaluation,<note place="margin">Rom. 10.20.</note> as Paul gathereth in the tenth chapt. to the Romanes, and as the prophet had ſet it downe before: <hi>Thou</hi> Lord, which heareſt the praier, vnto thee ſhall all fleſh come. Therefore for as much as no man is excluded from calling vpon God, the gate of ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſet open vnto all men. Neither is there anie other thing which keepeth vs back from entring in, ſaue onely our owne vnbeliefe. I ſpeake of all, vnto whom God doth make manifeſt himſelfe by the Goſpel. But like as thoſe which call vpon the name of the Lord are ſure of ſaluation, ſo we muſt thinke that without the ſame we are thriſe miſerable and vndone. And when as our ſaluation is placed in calling vppon God, there is nothing in the meane ſeaſon taken from faith, for as much as this inuocation is grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded in faith alone. There is alſo another circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance no leſſe worthie the noting: in that the Prophet doth ſignifie, that the calling vppon God doeth properly appertaine and agree vnto the laſt dayes. For although he woulde bee called vppon in all ages, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſince that hee ſhewed himſelfe to be a Father, in Chriſt,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:7788:29"/> we haue the more eaſie acceſſe vnto him. Which thing ought both the more to embolden vs, and to take from vs all ſluggiſhnes. As he himſelfe doth alſo reaſon, that by this priuiledge our forwardnes to pray, is dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to vs: Hitherto haue ye asked nothing in my name: aske, and yee ſhall receiue: as if he ſhould ſay, Heretofore although I did not yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to be a mediatour, and aduocate in the fleſh, yet did yee pray: but now when you ſhall haue me to bee your patron, with howe much more courage ought yee to do that?</p>

               <p n="22">22 <hi>Ieſus of Nazareth.</hi> Now doth Peter apply vnto his purpoſe the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie of Ioel: namely, that the Iewes may thereby know that the time of reſtoring was preſent: and that Chriſt was giuen them for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. For this promiſe was no otherwiſe to be fulfilled, ſaue onely by the comming of the mediatour. And this is the right vſe of all thoſe giftes which we haue by Chriſt, whiles that they bring vs vnto Chriſt, as vnto a fountaine. But he commeth hither by little and little. For he doth not by and by in the beginning affirme that Ieſus was Chriſt: but hee ſaieth, onely that hee was a man, ſent of God: and that doth he proue by his miracles. Afterward he addeth, that he roſe from death, when hee was ſlaine. Whereby it appeareth more certainly and more fully, that hee was not ſome one of the Prophets, but the verie ſonne of God, who was promiſed to bee the repairer of all things. Let this therefore be the firſt member, that Ieſus of Nazareth was a man approued of God by mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt teſtimonies, ſo that he could not bee deſpiſed, as ſome baſe and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

Therefore he ſaith, that he was ſhewed toward the Iewes: becauſe God woulde haue his ſon to be accounted excellent and great amongſt them. As if he ſhould ſay, that miracles were not appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for other nations, but for the Iewes: that they might know that Ieſus was ſent vnto them of God.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>By great workes.</hi> He calleth myracles by theſe three names.

In which reſpect they are alſo called Wonders: becauſe they make vs aſtonied. And for this cauſe are they called ſignes: becauſe the Lorde will not haue mens mindes to ſtay there, but to be lifted vp higher as they are referred vnto another ende. He put in three wordes, to the ende he might the more extoll Chriſt his myracles, and enforce the people by this heaping and laying of wordes together, to conſider the ſame. Furthermore he maketh not Chriſte the chiefe authour, but only the miniſter: becauſe as we haue alreadie ſaid, he determined to goe forwarde by degrees. Notwithſtanding here may a queſtion be asked, whether myracles do ſuffiſe to bee a ſufficient and iuſt approbation or no: becauſe by this meanes inchaunters might cauſe their legier-demaine, to be beleeued. I anſwere, that the iuggling caſts of Satan doe much differ from the power of God. Chriſt ſaith els<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, that the kingdome of Antichriſt ſhall bee in wonders,<note place="margin">2.

For God doth ſhew his power manifeſtly enough. Therfore there is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient approbatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the doctrine and of the miniſtery, in the myracles which God doth worke, ſo that we be not blinde. And whereas it is not of ſufficient force among the wicked, becauſe they may now &amp; then be deceiued with the falſe myracles of Satan, this muſt bee imputed vnto their owne blindneſſe: but whoſoeuer hath a pure heart, hee doeth alſo know God with the pure eies of his minde, ſo often as hee doeth ſhewe himſelfe. Neither can Satan otherwiſe delude vs, ſaue onely when tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the wickedneſſe of our heart, our iudgement is corrupt, and our eies blinded, or at leaſt bleared through our owne ſlothfulneſſe.</p>
               <p n="23">23 <hi>Him haue yee ſlaine.</hi> He maketh mention of the death of Chriſte for this cauſe chieflie, that the reſurrection might the more aſſuredlie be beleeued. It was a thing full well knowne among the Iewes that Chriſt was crucified. Therefore in that hee roſe againe, it is a great and wonderfull token of his diuine power. In the meane ſeaſon, to the ende he may pricke their conſciences with the feeling of ſinne, hee ſaith that they ſlue him. Not that they crucified him with their owne handes, but bicauſe the people with one voice deſired to haue him put to death. And although many of the hearers vnto whom he ſpeaketh, did not conſent vnto that wicked and vngodlie crueltie, yet doth hee iuſtly impute the ſame to the nation: becauſe all of them had defiled them ſelues ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with their ſilence, or els through their careleſneſſe. Neither hath the cloake and colour of ignoraunce any place, foraſmuch as he was ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed before of God.

                  <hi>By the determinate counſell.</hi> He remoueth a ſtumbling block: becauſe it ſeemeth at the firſt bluſh to be a thing verie inconuenient, that that man whom God had ſo greatlie adorned, being afterward laid open to all maner mocking, doth ſuffer ſo reprochfull a death. Therfore becauſe the croſſe of Chriſt doth commonly vſe to trouble vs at the firſt ſight, for this cauſe Peter declareth that he ſuffered nothing by chaunce, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he wanted power to deliuer himſelfe, but becauſe it was ſo deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined and appointed by God. For this knowledge alone; that the death of Chriſt was ordeined by the eternall counſell of God, did cut off all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of fooliſhe and wicked cogitations, and did preuent all offences which might otherwiſe be conceiued. For wee muſt know this, that God doth decree nothing in vaine or raſhly. Whereuppon it followeth that there was iuſt cauſe, for which he would haue Chriſt to ſuffer. The ſame knowledge of gods prouidence, is a ſteppe to conſider the end and frute of Chriſt his death. For this meeteth vs by &amp; by in the counſell of God, that the iuſt was deliuered for our ſinnes, &amp; that his blood was the price of our death. And heere is a notable place touching the prouidence of God, that we may knowe that aſwell our life as our death is gouerned by it Luke intreateth in deed of Chriſt. But in his perſon we haue a mirror, which doth repreſent vnto vs the vniuerſall prouidence of God, which doeth ſtretch it ſelf throughout the whole world: yet doeth it ſpecially ſhine vnto vs who are the members of Chriſt. Luke ſetteth downe two things in this place, the foreknowledge, and the decree of God. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the foreknowledge of God is former in order (becauſe God doth firſt ſee what he will determine, before hee doth in deed determine the ſame) yet doth he put the ſame after the counſell and decree of God, to the end we may know that God would nothing, neither appointed any thing, ſaue that which he had long before directed to his end. For men do oftentimes raſhly decree many things, becauſe they decree them ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly. Therefore to the end Peter may teach that the counſell of God is not without reaſon, he coupleth alſo therewithall his foreknowledge. Now we muſt diſtinguiſh theſe two, and ſo much the more diligentlie, becauſe manie are deceiued in this point. For paſſing ouer the counſell of God, wherewith he doth guide and gouerne the whole worlde, they catch at his bare foreknowledge. Thence commeth that common di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, that although God doth foreſee all things, yet doth he lay no neceſſitie vpon his creatures. And in deed it is true that God doth know this thing or that thing before, for this cauſe, becauſe it ſhall come to paſſe: but as we ſee that Peter doth teach that God did not onely fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee that which befell Chriſt, but it was decreed by him. And hence muſt bee gathered a generall doctrine: becauſe God doeth no leſſe ſhewe his prouidence in gouerning the whole worlde, than in ordaining and appointing the death of Chriſte. Therefore it belongeth to God not only to know before, things to come, but of his owne will to determine what he will haue done. This ſecond thing did Peter declare, when hee ſaide, That he was deliuered by the certain and determinate counſel of God. Therfore the foreknowledge of god is another thing tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the wil of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:7788:30"/> God, whereby he gouerneth and ordereth all things. Some which are of quicker ſight, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe, that god doth not onely foreknow, but alſo gouern with his beck what things ſoeuer are done in the world. Neuertheleſſe they imagine a confuſed gouernment, as if God did giue libertie to his creatures to follow their owne nature. They ſay that the Sunne is ruled by the will of God, becauſe in giuing light to vs, he doth his dutie, which was once enioyned him by God. They think that man hath free will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this ſort left him, becauſe his nature is diſpoſed or inclined vnto the free choyce of good and euill. But they which thinke ſo, doe feigne that God ſitteth idle in heauen. The ſcripture teacheth vs farre otherwiſe, which aſcribeth vnto God a ſpecial gouernment in all things, &amp; in mans actions. Notwithſtanding it is our dutie to ponder &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider to what end it teacheth this. For we muſt beware of doting ſpeculations, wherewith we ſee many carried away. The ſcripture will exerciſe our faith, that we may know that we are defended by the hand of God, leaſt we be ſubiect to the iniuries of Satan and the wicked. It is good for vs to imbrace this one thing: neither did Peter meane any thing els in this place. Yea wee haue an example ſet before vs in Chriſt, whereby we may learne to bee wiſe with ſobrietie. For it is out of queſtion, that his fleſh was ſubiect to corruption, according to nature. But the prouidence of God did ſet the ſame free. If any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aske whether the bones of Chriſt could be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken or no: it is not to be denied, that they were ſubiect to breaking na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally, yet could there no bone be broken,<note place="margin">Iohn. 19.36.</note> becauſe God had ſo appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and determined. By this example (I ſay) we are taught ſo to giue the chiefeſt roome to gods prouidence, that we keepe ourſelues within our bounds: and that we thruſt not our ſelues raſhlie &amp; vndiſcretly into the ſecretes of God, whither our eieſight doth not pearce.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>By the handes of the wicked.</hi> Becauſe Peter ſeemeth to graunt, that the wicked did obey God; hereupon followeth two abſurdities: the one, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that God is the author of euils: or that men do not ſin what wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſoeuer they commit. I anſwere concerning the ſecond, that the wic<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ked do nothing leſſe than obey God, howſoeuer they doe execute that which God hath determined with himſelf. For obedience ſpringeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a voluntarie affection. And we know that the wicked haue a farre other purpoſe. Again, no man obeieth God, ſaue he which knoweth his will. Therfore obedience dependeth vpon the knowledge of Gods will. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore God hath reuealed vnto vs his will in the law: wherfore thoſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do obey god, who do that alone which is agreeable to the law of god: And againe, which ſubmit themſelues willingly to his gouernment. Wee ſee no ſuch thing in al the wicked, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> god doth driue hither &amp; thither, they themſelues being ignorant. No man therfore will ſay that they are excuſable vnder this colour, becauſe they obey god: for as much as both the wil of God muſt be ſought in his lawe: and they ſo muche as in them lyeth, doe couet to reſiſt God. As touching the other point, I denie that God is the Authour of euill: becauſe there is a certaine noting of a wicked affection in this worde. For the wicked deede is eſteemed according to the ende whereat a man aymeth. When men committe
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:7788:31"/> theft or murder, they offend for this cauſe, becauſe they are theeues or murderers. And in the theft and murder, there is a wicked purpoſe. God who vſeth their wickedneſſe is to be placed in the higher degree. For he hath reſpect vnto a farre other thing, becauſe he will chaſtice the one, &amp; exerciſe the patience of the other: &amp; ſo he doth neuer decline from his nature, that is from perfect righteouſneſſe. So that, whereas Chriſt was deliuered by the hands of wicked men, wheras he was crucified, it came to paſſe by the appointment and ordinaunce of God. But treaſon which is of it ſelfe wicked, and murther which hath in it ſo great wickedneſſe, muſt not be thought to be the workes of God.</p>
               <p n="24">24 <hi>Hauing looſed the ſorrowes of death.</hi> By the ſorrowes of death I vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand ſome farther thing than the bodily ſenſe or feeling. For thoſe which dulie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider the nature of death: becauſe they heare that it is the curſe of God, muſt needes conceiue that God is angrie in death. Hence commeth marueilous horror: wherein there is greater miſerie than in death it ſelfe. Furthermore, Chriſte died vppon this condition, that hee might take vpon him our guiltineſſe. That inward feare of conſcience, which made him ſo afraid, that he ſwet blood, when he preſented himſelf before the throne and tribunall ſeate of God, did more vexe him, and brought vpon him greater horror, than al the torments of the fleſh. And whereas Peter ſaith, that Chriſt did wraſtle with ſuch ſorrowes, &amp; doth alſo declare that he had the victorie: by this it commeth to paſſe, that the faithfull ought not now to be afraid of death. For death hath not the like qualitie now which was in Adam: becauſe by the victorie of Chriſte the curſe of God is ſwallowed vp.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15.54.</note> Wee feele in deede yet the pricking of ſorrowes, but ſuch as do not wholy wound vs, whileſt that we hold vp the buckler of faith againſt them.

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:7788:31"/> and euident teſtimonies, and which might alſo haue been gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out of the continuall doctrine of the prophetes, was to be proued to the Iewes as ſome new and ſtrange thing. And no maruell. For wee ſee that although Chriſte had oftentimes beat the ſame into his Diſciples heads, yet did they profite but a little. And yet did they retaine certaine principles of true doctrine, which might haue made a way for them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the knowledge of Chriſt: as we ſhall ſee by &amp; by. Therfore becauſe the gift of the Spirite was a frute of the reſurrection of Chriſt, he prooueth by the teſtimonie of Dauid, that Chriſt muſt needes haue riſen againe, that the Iewes may thereby knowe that hee was the authour of the gift. For he taketh it as a thing which all men graunt, that he was rayſed vp from death, that he may liue not for himſelf, but for his. Nowe wee ſee Peter his drift. That that ought to ſeeme no ſtraunge thing, which was foretolde ſo long before. And that Ieſus is alſo Chriſte, becauſe Dauid did propheſie of him, as of the head of the church. Firſt of all wee muſt ſee whether this place ought altogether to be vnderſtood of Chriſte, as Peter affirmeth: that done, if there bee any thing in the wordes worth the noting, wee will in order diſcuſſe it. Peter denieth that that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth with Dauid, which is ſaid in this place: Thou ſhalt not ſuffer thine holie one to ſee corruption:<note place="margin">Pſal. 16.6.</note> becauſe Dauid his carkaſſe was corrupt in the graue. It ſeemeth at the firſt bluſh to be but a light argument. For a man might eaſily obiect, That the word is not to be vrged, foraſmuch as Dauid meant nothing elſe, ſaue onely to exempt himſelfe from deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Therefore howſoeuer corruption did touche him, yet doth that no whit hinder, but that he may eaſily ſay that he was ſafe from the danger thereof: becauſe he knew that the Lorde would deliuer him. Yea it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be a repetition of the former ſentence, according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon cuſtome of the Hebrewe tongue. Which if it be ſo, the ſenſe ſhalbe plaine, that God will not ſuffer him to be oppreſſed with death, or that death ſhould conſume him. And this interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is confirmed by that that where we read, <hi>hell,</hi> it is in Hebrewe <hi>Seol:</hi> where we read <hi>corruption,</hi> there it is <hi>Shachat.</hi> Both theſe words do ſignifie the graue. By this means Dauid ſhould ſay twiſe, that he ſhalbe deliuered from death by the grace of God. Finally, he ſaith the ſame thing in this place, which he ſaith, Pſa. 49. God ſhall redeeme my ſoule from the hand of hell.<note place="margin">Pſal. 49.16.</note> Like as on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, when he ſpeaketh of the reprobates, he is wont to take, <hi>going</hi> downe into the graue, for deſtruction. I aunſwere brieflie, that there is ſome greater thing expreſſed in this place, than the common redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or deliuerance of the godly. Dauid in deede doeth promiſe that God wil be his eternall deliuerer as well in life as in death. Neither hadde he been muche better for this, to haue been once deliuered from one daunger, vnleſſe he had hoped that he ſhould be ſafe euen vnto the end through Gods protection: but he ſpeaketh of ſuch ſafetie as is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. And ſurely the wordes doe ſound that he ſpeaketh of ſome new &amp; ſingular priuiledge. Admit I graunt that it is a repetitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; that ther is al one thing vttered in theſe two members, Thou ſhalt not leaue my ſoule in hell &amp;, Thou ſhalt not ſuffer me to ſee corruption: yet do I denie that
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:7788:32"/> it is ſimpy to bee vnderſtood that God will deliuer his holie one from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall deſtruction. For freedome from corruption is promiſed by name. Neither do I paſſe for this, that <hi>Shachat</hi> doeth ſignifie the graue, as <hi>Seol,</hi> which is put in the former member. For although I do not ſtand nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend about the wordes, yet muſt we reſpect the <hi>Etymologie.</hi> Therefore for aſmuch as the graue is called <hi>Shachat,</hi> becauſe it doeth corrupt mans bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye with rottenneſſe, it is not to bee doubted but that Dauid meant to note that qualitie. Therfore the place is not ſo much expreſſed by this word, as the condition of rotting. So that the ſenſe is, that God will not ſuffer him of whom the Pſalme ſpeaketh, To rot or corrupt in the graue. And foraſmuch as Dauid was not free from this neceſſitie, it followeth that the propheſie was neither truely nor perfectly fulfilled in him. And that the Pſalm ought altogether to be expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded of Chriſte, the thing it ſelfe doth proue.<note place="margin">Gen. 3.19.</note> For ſeeing that Dauid was one of the ſonnes of Ada<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he could not eſcape that vniuerſal condition and eſtate of mankinde, Duſt thou art, &amp; into duſt thou ſhalt return: the graue ſtandeth ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (I ſay) for al the children of Adam, that it may ſwallow the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vp, &amp; conſume them: ſo that no man can exempt himſelf fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> corruption. So that beholdding our ſelues apart from Chriſt, we ſee the graue prepared for vs, which threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to vs corruption. Wherfore if Dauid be ſeparated from Chriſt, that ſhal not belong to him which is here ſaid, that he ſhalbe preſerued from the graue. Therfore when he boaſteth that he ſhalbe free fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the graue, as touching corruption, without all doubt he placeth himſelf in the body of Chriſt, wherin death was ouercome, &amp; the kingdom therof aboliſhed. But &amp; if Dauid do promiſe himſelf exempting from the graue in another reſpect, ſaue only ſo far foorth as he is a member of Chriſt, hereby it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth that this freedome muſt begin at Chriſte as at the head. What man ſoeuer ſhalbe of ſound iudgement, ſhall eaſily knowe that this is a good argument, God did put al mankind vnder corruption: Therefore Dauid, inaſmuch as he was of the number of men, could not be free from the ſame. Neither is it to be doubted, but that the Iewes, before who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this ſermon was made, foraſmuch as without queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that <hi>maxim</hi> was of force amongſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that they were to hope for the reſtoring of thinges at the hands of Chriſte alone, did the more readily ſtay themſelues vppon the words of Peter: becauſe they ſaw that that could no otherwiſe be which the words do import, vnleſſe they ſhould apply it to the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> For they were not come to that point of impudencie, at leaſt thoſe of whom men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made heere, that they durſt cauil in matters which were euident. For god had then offered vnto his diſciples thoſe which were godly hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, and apt to bee taught. They ſought the <hi>Meſſias</hi> in the olde Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. They knew that Dauid was a figure of him. There was amongeſt them ſome religion, and reuerence of the ſcriptures then. But nowe the impudencie of all the whole nation almoſt is deſperate. Howeſoeuer they be vrged, they wrench themſelues out one way or other. Where ther is no way to eſcape, yet they break through. Althogh they be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, yet wil they not yeld. Neither is it to be douted, but that this their ſhameles frowardnes, is a puniſhment for their vngodlines. But let vs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn vnto Peter his ſermon. Seing that Dauid doth not only affirm that
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:7788:32"/> God alſo ſhalbe his deliuerer, but doth expreſſe a ſingular way &amp; means: namelie, that he ſhal not be ſubiect to the corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the graue, Peter doth for good cauſes gather, that that doth not properly appertain vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him for that his body was corrupt in the graue. And now becauſe this had byn ſomwhat hard to be ſpoken among the Iewes, he mollifieth the hardnes with a circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>locutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For he doth not flatlie denie in one worde, that that was fulfilled in deed in Dauid, but doth only by the way ſignifie ſo much vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, becauſe he lyeth conſumed in the graue after the com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mon cuſtom of other men. And Dauid did ſo propheſie of Chriſt, that he did both apply this conſolatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto himſelf priuately, &amp; alſo extend the ſame vnto the whole body of the church. For that which is ſound &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in the head, is ſpread abroad, being afterward powred out into al the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers Neither is it to be denied, but that Dauid ſpake of himſelf in this place: yet only ſo far foorth as he beheld himſelf in Chriſt, as in the mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of life. Firſt he hath reſpect vnto Chriſte: after that he turneth his eies toward himſelf, &amp; other the faithful. So that we haue a generall do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin preſcribed vnto vs in this place, concerning the nature of faith, the ſpiritual ioy of conſcience, &amp; the hope of eternall deliuerance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I ſaw.</hi> We muſt hold this principle, if we will haue God preſent with vs, we muſt ſet him before our eies: &amp; that before he do appear: for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of faith pearceth farre further than vnto the preſent experience. Therfore faith hath this propertie, to ſet god alwaies before it as a guide in all dangers &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fuſed matters. For there is nothing that doth ſo much hold vs vp, as when we know that God is preſent with vs: as the opinion of his abſence doth often caſt vs down, &amp; at length quite diſcourage vs. Dauid addeth, That he tooke not heed in vain vnto the directio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God. He is (ſaith he) at my right hand: whereby he doth ſignifie: that we need not to fear leaſt we be deceiued, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as we ſet him before vs as preſent: for we ſhal alwaies feel his help moſt readie. Faith in hoping for the help of God, ought to preuent &amp; ouergoe al experience, &amp; whatſoeuer is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by the ſenſe: but ſo ſoone as it ſhall giue this glorie to God, that it doeth beholde him in his worde, although he be abſent, and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, inuiſible, it ſhall be ouercome with the effect of the thing. For the meaſure of faith is not able to comprehend the infinite greatneſſe of the power &amp; goodnes of God. He draweth a ſimilitude fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe which when they will vnderprop the weak, or ſtrengthen the fearefull, do ioine the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues vnto their ſide. Not to be moued, is not to be thrown down fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their degree, but to remain firme in their eſtate: like as alſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 46,<note place="margin">Pſal. 46.6.</note> God is in the midſt of it, therfore ſhall it not be moued. For although it come to paſſe ſometimes that the godly, bee ſore ſhaken, yet becauſe they come to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues again, they are ſaid to cotinue firme. Therefore there is no cauſe why they ſhould be afraid of falling, who are vpholde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the help of God. Like as on the other ſide, thoſe which place their ſtrength any where els ſaue only in God, they ſhall be like to fall at euery blaſt of wind, but at any mean wind of temptation they ſhall fall to the ground.</p>

But that ſure truſt which we repoſe in God, doth not only deliuer vs from carefulneſſe, but doth alſo repleniſhe our hearts with wonderfull ioy and gladneſſe. That is the ioy, which Chriſt promiſed to his diſciples, ſhould be full in them; and which hee teſtified could not bee taken from them.<note place="margin">Ioh. 16.22. and 17.13.</note> Iohn 16. &amp; 17. He expreſſeth the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the ioy, when he ſaith, That it cannot be kept in, but that it will break foorth into the gladnes of the tonge. <hi>Cabod</hi> doth ſignifie in deed, glory, but it is taken in that place as in many other for the Tongue. And ſo the Grecians haue truly tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſlated the ſame. The reſt of the <hi>fleſh,</hi> doth ſignifie the quietnes of the whole man, which we haue through the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of God. Neither is this any let, becauſe the faithful are continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allie out of quiet and tremble: for as in the middeſt of ſorrowes they do neuertheles reioyce: ſo there are no troubles ſo great that can break the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their reſt. If any man obiect that the peace of the faithfull doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in the ſpirite, and that it is not of the fleſh: I anſwere, that the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full doe reſt in bodie: not that they are free from troubles, but becauſe they beleeue that God careth for them wholie, and that not only their ſoule ſhalbe ſafe through his protection, but their bodie alſo.</p>
               <p n="27">27 <hi>Becauſe thou ſhalt not leaue.</hi> To leaue the ſoule in hell, is to ſuffer the ſame to be oppreſſed with deſtruction.

Thoſe thinges which are diſputed in this place by diuers, concerning the deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending of Chriſte into hell, are in my iudgement ſuperfluous: becauſe they are farre from the intent and purpoſe of the Prophet. For the word <hi>anima</hi> or <hi>ſoule,</hi> doth not ſo much ſignifie the ſpirite being of an immortal eſſence, as the life it ſelf. For when a man is dead, and lieth in the graue, the graue is ſaid to rule ouer his life. Whereas the Grecians tranſlate it <hi>holie,</hi> it is in Hebrew <hi>Chaſſith,</hi> which doth properly ſignifie meek, or, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, but Luke did not much regard this, becauſe it doth not much apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnto the preſent purpoſe. Furthermore gentleneſſe and meeknes is ſo often commended in the faithfull, becauſe it behoueth them to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate and reſemble the nature of their Father.</p>
               <p n="28">28 <hi>Thou haſt made knowen.</hi> He meaneth that he was reſtored fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> death to life by the grace of God.

As for the members they haue their meaſure. Therefore Chriſt was far from corruption, that he may be the firſt frutes of thoſe which riſe from death. We ſhal folow him in our order at length, but being firſt turned into duſt. That which foloweth, that <hi>he was filled with gladneſſe,</hi> with
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:7788:33"/> the countenaunce of God agreeth with that: Shew vs thy face, and we ſhalbe ſafe. And againe, The light of thy countenaunce is ſhewed vpon vs: thou haſt put gladneſſe in my heart. For it is only the pleaſantnes of Gods countenance, which doth not only make vs glad, but alſo quicken vs: againe, when the ſame is turned away or troubled, wee muſt needes faint.</p>
               <p n="30">30 <hi>Therfore ſeeing he was a prophet.</hi> He ſheweth by two reaſons that it is no maruell, if Dauid doe ſpeak of things that ſhould come to paſſe long after his time: the former is, becauſe hee was a prophet. And wee knowe that things to come, &amp; ſuch as are remoued far from the knowledge of men, are reuealed vnto the Prophetes. Therefore it were wickedneſſe to meaſure their ſpeeches according to the common manner and order, which we vſe in meaſuring the ſpeeches of other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, foraſmuch as they goe beyond the long courſes of yeeres, hauing the Spirite for their dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter. Whereuppon they are alſo called <hi>Seers:</hi> becauſe beeing placed as it were vpon an high tower, they ſee thoſe things which by reaſon of great diſtaunce are hidden from other men. Another reaſon is, becauſe Chriſt was promiſed to him peculiarly. This <hi>maxime</hi> was ſo common amongeſt the Iewes, that they had euer now and then the ſonne of Dauid in their mouth, ſo often as there was any mention made of Chriſt. They bee no ſuch arguments I confeſſe, as doe neceſſarilie proue, that this propheſie is to be expounded of Chriſt: neither was that Peter his intent and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: but firſt he meant to preuent the contrarie obiection, whence Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid had ſuch skill to foretell a thing which was vnknowen. Therefore he ſaieth, That hee knewe Chriſte, both by propheticall reuelation, and alſo by a ſingular promiſe. Furthermore, this principle was of greate force amongſt the better minded ſort, which Paule ſetteth downe,<note place="margin">Rom. 10.4.</note> that Chriſt is the ende of the lawe. No man therefore did doubt of this, but that this was the marke whereat all the Prophetes did ayme, to lead the Godlie vnto Chriſte as it were by the hande. Therefore what notable or extraordinarie thing ſoeuer they did vtter, the Iewes were common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie perſwaded that it did agree with Chriſte. Furthermore wee muſt note, that Peter doeth reaſon ſoundely, when hee gathereth that Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid was not ignoraunt of that which was the chiefeſt point of all reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hee had ſworne with an oth.</hi> God ſware, not only to the ende he might make Dauid beleue his promiſe, but alſo that the thing promiſed might be had in greater eſtimation. And to this end in my iudgement it is here repeated, that the Iewes may think with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, of what great weight the promiſe was, which God did make ſo notable &amp; ſo famous. The ſame admonition is profitable for vs alſo. For we neede not to doubt of this, but that the Lorde meant to ſet foorth the excellencie of the couenant, by putting in a ſolemne othe. In the meane ſeaſon this is alſo a fit reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die for the infirmitie of our faith, that the ſacred name of God is ſet foorth vnto vs, that his wordes may carrie the greater credite. Theſe wordes <hi>according to the fleſhe,</hi> do declare that there was ſome more noble thing in Chriſte than the fleſhe. Therefore Chriſte did ſo come of the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:7788:34"/> ſeed of Dauid as he was man, that he doth neuertheleſſe retaine his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie: and ſo the diſtinction betweene the two natures is plainely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed: when as Chriſt is called the ſonne of God, according to his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall eſſence, in like ſort as he is called the ſeed of Dauid according to the fleſhe.</p>

               <p n="33">33 <hi>Hee beeing therefore exalted by the right hande of God.</hi> The righte hande is taken in this place for the hande or power, in like ſort it is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken euerie where in the ſcripture.

               <p>
                  <hi>The promiſe</hi> of the Spirit, for the Spirite which was promiſed. For he had oftentimes before promiſed the Spirite to his Apoſtles. Therefore Peter doth ſignifie, that Chriſte had obteined power of God the Father to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill the ſame. And he maketh mention of the promiſe in plaine wordes, to the ende the Iewes may knowe that this came not to paſſe ſodainlye, but that the wordes of the prophet were nowe verified, which went long time before the thing it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, whereas it is ſaide, That he obteined it of <hi>the father,</hi> it is to be applyed to the perſon of the Mediatour. For both theſe are trulie ſaide, That Chriſt ſent the Spirite from him ſelfe, and from the Father. He ſent him from himſelfe; becauſe hee is eternall God: From the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; becauſe in as much as hee is man, hee receiueth that of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which he giueth vs. And Peter ſpeaketh wiſely according to the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitie
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:7788:34"/> of the ignorant, leaſt any man ſhuld moue a queſtion out of ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon concerning the power of Chriſt. And ſurely foraſmuche as it is the office of Chriſt to direct vs vnto his Father, this is a moſt apt forme of ſpeaking for the vſe of godlineſſe, that Chriſte being placed as it were in the middeſt betweene God and vs, doth deliuer vnto vs with his owne hande, thoſe giftes which he hath receiued at the handes of his Father. Furthermore, we muſt note this order that hee ſayeth, that the Spirite was ſent by Chriſte after that he was exalted. This agreeth with thoſe ſentences: The Spirite was not yet giuen, becauſe Chriſte was not yet glorified. And againe, Vnleſſe I goe hence, the Spirite will not come.<note place="margin">Ioh. 7.39. Ioh. 16.7.</note> Not becauſe the Spirite began then firſt to be giuen, wherewith the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Fathers were endued ſince the beginning of the worlde: but becauſe God did deferre this more plentifull abundaunce of grace, vntil ſuche time as he had placed Chriſte in his princely ſeate: which is ſignified by this worde <hi>poured out,</hi> as we ſaw a little before. For by this meanes the force and frute of Chriſte his death and reſurrection is ſealed: and wee doe alſo thereby knowe that wee haue loſt nothing by Chriſte his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting out of the worlde: becauſe though hee bee abſent in bodie, yet is hee preſent with vs after a better ſort, to wit, by the grace of his holie Spirite.</p>
               <p n="34">34 <hi>For doubtleſſe Dauid.</hi> Although they might eaſily gather by the very effect which they ſawe with their eyes, that the principalitie was graunted and giuen to Chriſte, yet to the ende his glory may carrie the greater credite, hee prooueth by Dauid his teſtimonie, that it was ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in times paſt by God, that Chriſt ſhould be lifted vppe vnto the higheſt degree of honour. For theſe wordes to <hi>ſit at the right hand of God,</hi> import as much as to beare the chiefe rule, as we ſhall afterwarde more at large declare. Yet before he reciteth the propheſie, he ſaieth, That it agreeth onely to Chriſt. Therefore to the ende the ſenſe may bee more manifeſt, the ſentence muſt thus runne. Dauid pronounceth that it was decreed by God that a king ſhoulde ſit at his right hand. But this doeth not appertaine vnto Dauid, who was neuer extolled vnto ſo great dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie. Therefore he ſpeaketh this of Chriſte. Furthermore that ought to haue ſeemed no ſtrange thing vnto the Iewes, which was foretold by the Oracle of the holie Ghoſt. Hereby it appeareth in what ſenſe Peter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth, that Dauid aſcended into heauen. He intreateth not in this place of the ſoule of Dauid, whether it were receiued into bleſſed reſt, and the heauenlie dwelling or no: but the aſcending into heauen comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vnder it thoſe thinges which Paule teacheth in the Epiſtle to the Epheſians, the fourth Chapter, where he placeth Chriſte aboue all hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens, that he may fulfill al things. Wherfore the diſputation concerning the eſtate of the dead is altogether ſuperfluous in this place. For Peter goeth about to proue no other thing but this, that the propheſie concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſitting at the right hand of God, was not fulfilled in Dauid, and that therefore the truth thereof muſt bee ſought elswhere. And for as muche as it can bee founde no where els ſaue onely in Ieſus Chriſte: it reſteth that the Iewes doe knowe that that is ſhewed to them in Chriſt,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:7788:35"/> which was foretold them ſo long before. That is true indeed, that Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid reigned, God being the authour hereof, and in ſome reſpect hee was Gods vicegerent: yet not ſo that he might be aboue all creatures. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this ſitting agreeth to none, vnleſſe hee excell and be aboue all the whole world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Lorde ſaid vnto my Lorde.</hi> This is the moſt lawfull manner of ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,<note place="margin">Pſal. 100.1. Heb. 5.5.</note> when as the king (or by what other title ſoeuer he be called) doeth knowe that hee is ordeined of God, therefore Dauid pronounceth that the commaundement to reigne, was giuen vnto Chriſt by name As if he ſhould ſay, He tooke not the honour to himſelfe raſhlie, but did onely o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey God when he commaunded him. Now muſt we ſee whether Peter his reaſon be ſound enough or no. Hee gathereth that the wordes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne Chriſt, becauſe the ſitting at the right hande of God, doth not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to Dauid. It ſeemeth that this may be refuted, becauſe Dauid did reigne by the peculiar commandement, name, and helpe of God: which is to ſit at the right hande of God. But Peter taketh that for a thing which all men graunt, which is true, and which I haue alreadie touched, that a greater and more royal gouernment is heere ſpoken of, than that which Dauid did inioy. For howſoeuer he was gods vicegerent, &amp; did as it were repreſent his perſon in reigning, yet is this power farre inferiour to that, to ſit euen at the right ſide of GOD. For this is attributed to Chriſte, becauſe he is placed aboue all principalitie, and aboue euerie name that is named, both in this worlde, and in the world to come. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Dauid is farre inferiour to the Angels, he doth poſſeſſe no ſuch place that he ſhould be counted next to God. For he muſt aſcende farre aboue all heauens, that he may come to the right hand of God. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no man is ſaid to ſit at it, rightlie and properly, ſaue only hee which doth ſurpaſſe all creatures in the degree of honour. As for him which is reſident amongſt the creatures, although he be reckoned in the order of angels, yet is he farre from that highneſſe. Again, we muſt not ſeeke the right hande of God amongeſt the creatures: but it doth alſo ſurpaſſe all heauenly principalities. Furthermore there is great waight euen in the ſentence it ſelfe. This king is commaunded to beare the chiefeſt rule, vntill God haue put all his enemies vnder his feete. Surely, although I graunt that the name of ſuch an honourable ſitting may bee appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vnto earthly Lordeſhip, yet doe I denie that Dauid did reigne vntyll ſuch time as all his enemies were ſubdued. For wee doe heereby gather that the kingdome of Chriſte is eternall. But the kingdome of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid was not onelie temporall, but alſo frayle, and of a ſmall continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunce.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, when Dauid dyed, hee left manie enemies aliue here and there. He got many notable victories: but he was farre from ſubduing al his enemies. Hee made manie of thoſe people which were round about him tributaries to him: ſome did he put to flight, &amp; deſtroyed: but what is all this vnto all? Finally, wee may prooue by the whole text of the Pſalm, that there can nothing els be vnderſtood ſaue only the kingdome of Chriſt. That I may paſſe ouer other things, that which is here ſpoken
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:7788:35"/> touching the eternall Prieſthood, is too farre diſagreeing from Dauid his perſon. I know what the Iewes doe prattle: that kinges ſonnes are called elswher <hi>Cohenim.</hi> But he intreateth here of the prieſthood, as it is aſcribed by Moſes to the king Melchiſedech. And there is eſtabliſhed by a ſolemne othe, a certaine newe kinde of prieſthood. And therefore we muſt not heere imagine anie common or ordinarie thing. But it had been wickedneſſe for Dauid to thruſt himſelf into any part of the Prieſt his office. How ſhould he then be called <hi>Cohen</hi> greater than Aaron, and conſecrated of God for euer? But becauſe I doe not intend at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to expounde the whole Pſalme, let this reaſon ſuffice which Peter bringeth, That he is made Lord of heauen &amp; earth, which ſitteth at the right hand of God. As touching the ſecond member of the verſe, reade thoſe things which I haue noted vpon the fifteenth Chapter of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Epiſtle to the Corinthians,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15.25.</note> concerning the putting of his enemies vnder his feet.</p>
               <p n="36">36 <hi>Therefore let all the houſe of Iſrael know.</hi> The houſe of Iſrael did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that that Chriſt ſhould come which was promiſed: yet did they not know who it was. Therfore Peter concludeth, that Ieſus whom they had ſo ſpitefully handled, yea whoſe name they did ſo greatly deteſt, is hee whom they ought to acknowledge to be their Lord, &amp; whom they ought to reuerence. For (ſaith he) God hath made him Lorde &amp; Chriſt: that is, you muſt look for none other, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him whom God hath made &amp; giuen. Furthermore, he ſaith, That he was <hi>made,</hi> becauſe God the Father gaue him this honor. He ioyneth the title <hi>Lord</hi> with the word <hi>Christ,</hi> becauſe it was a common thing among the Iewes, that the Redeemer ſhould be annointed vpon this conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that he might be the head of the church, and that the chiefeſt power ouer all thinges might be giuen him. Hee ſpeaketh vnto the whole houſe of Iſrael: as if he ſhould ſay, whoſoeuer will be reckoned among the ſonnes of Iacob, and doe alſo looke for the promiſe, let them knowe for a ſuretie, that this is he and none other. He vſeth the worde <hi>houſe,</hi> becauſe God had ſeparated that name and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie from all other people. And he ſaith, <hi>aſphalos,</hi> or for a ſuretie, not only that they may repoſe their ſure confidence and truſt in Chriſte but that he may take away all occaſion of doubting from thoſe which doe often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times willingly doubt euen of matters which are certaine &amp; ſure. In the end of his oration he vpbraideth vnto them again, that they did crucifie him, that being touched with greater griefe of conſcience, they may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire remedie.</p>
               <p>And nowe foraſmuche as they knowe that Ieſus is the annointed of the Lorde, the gouernour of the church, and the giuer of the holy ghoſt, the accuſation hath ſo much the more force. For the putting of him to death was not onely full of crueltie and wickedneſſe, but alſo a teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of outragious diſloyaltie againſt God, of ſacrilege and vnthankeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and finally, of Apoſtacie. But it was requiſite that they ſhoulde bee ſo wounded, leaſt they ſhould haue been ſlow to ſeeke for medicine. And yet notwithſtanding they did not crucifie him with their owne handes: but this is more then ſufficient to make them guilty, in that they deſired
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:7788:36" rendition="simple:additions"/> to haue him put to death. And we alſo are accuſed by this ſame voice, if we crucifie him in our ſelues,<note place="margin">Heb. 6.6.</note> being alreadie glorified in heauen, making a mocke of him, as ſaith the Apoſtle, Heb. 6.</p>

And he noteth a double frute: firſt that they were touched with the feeling of ſorrowe, and ſecondly that they were obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to Peter his counſell. This is the beginning of Repentance, this is the entrance vnto godlines, to be ſory for our ſinnes, and to be wounded with the feeling of our miſeries. For ſo long as me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are careleſſe, they can not take ſuch heed vnto doctrine as they ought. And for this cauſe the word of God is compared to a ſword:<note place="margin">Iohn. 15.16. Heb. 4.12. Gen. 4.13. Mat. 27.3.</note> becauſe it doth mortifie our fleſh, that we may be offered to God for a ſacrifice. But there muſt bee added vnto this pricking in hart, readineſſe to obey. Cain and Iudas were pric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in heart, but deſpaire did keepe them backe from ſubmitting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vnto GOD. For the minde beeing oppreſſed with horrour, can do nothing els but flie from god. And ſurelie when Dauid affirmeth that a contrite ſpirite, and an humble heart is a ſacrifice acceptable to God, he ſpeaketh of voluntarie pricking: foraſmuche as there is fretting and fuming mixed with the prickings of the wicked. Therefore we muſt take a good hearte to vs, &amp; lift vp our minde with this hope of ſaluation, that we may be ready to addict &amp; giue ouer our ſelues vnto God, &amp; to follow whatſoeuer he ſhall commaund. We ſee many oftentimes pricked, who notwithſtanding do fret and murmure, or els frowardly ſtriue and ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, and ſo conſequently goe furiouſly madde. Yea this is the cauſe why they goe mad, becauſe they feele ſuch prickings againſt their wil. Thoſe men therefore are profitablie pricked alone, who are willingly ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and doe alſo ſeeke ſome remedie at Gods handes.</p>
               <p n="38">38 <hi>Peter ſaid.</hi> Hereby we ſee that thoſe do neuer go away empty, which ask at the mouth of the Lord, &amp; do offer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues vnto him to be ruled and taught:<note place="margin">Mat. 7.7.</note> for that promiſe muſt needes be true, Knocke, and it ſhalbe opened vnto you.

               <p>
                  <hi>Repent.</hi> There is greater force in the Greeke word: for it doth ſignifie the conuerſion of the mind, that the whole man may be renued, &amp; made another ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Which thing muſt be diligently noted, bicauſe this doctrine was miſerablie corrupted in the time of Poperie: for they tranſlated the name of <hi>repentance</hi> almoſt vnto certain externall rites. They babble ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what in deed about the feigned contrition of the heart, but they touche that part very ſleightly, &amp; they ſtand principallie vpon the externall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes of the body, which were little worth: Yea though ther were in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no corruption. But they vrge nothing els in a manner but feigned trifles, wherwith men are wearied in vain. Wherfore let vs know that this is the true Repentance, when a man is renued in the ſpirit of his mind, as Paul teacheth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. Neither need wee to doubt of this,<note place="margin">Rom. 12.1.</note> but that Peter did preach plainly of the force &amp; nature of Repentance: but Luke doth only touch the chief points, and doth not reckon vp the wordes of the orati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which he made. We muſt therfore know thus much, that Peter did at the firſt exhort the Iewes vnto repentance: &amp; that done he lifted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vp with hope of pardon. For he promiſed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> forgiuenes of ſins. Which two things are the two parts of the goſpel, as we know full well. And therfore when Chriſt will briefly teach what the doctrine of the Goſpel doth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, he ſaith that that repentance &amp; remiſſion of ſinnes muſt bee prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in his name. Furthermore, becauſe we are reconciled vnto god,<note place="margin">Luk. 24.47.</note> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the interceſſion of Chriſt his death, neither are our ſinnes other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe purged, &amp; done away, ſaue only by his blood, therfore Peter calleth vs back vnto him by name. Hee putteth Baptiſme in the fourth place, as the ſeale whereby the promiſe of grace is confirmed. Wherefore wee haue in theſe few words almoſt the whole ſumme of chriſtianitie, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie how a man renouncing himſelf &amp; taking his fare well of the worlde, may addict himſelf wholy to God. Secondly how he may be deliuered by free forgiuenes of ſinnes, &amp; ſo adopted into the number of the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God. And foraſmuch as we can obtaine none of all theſe things without Chriſt, the name of Chriſt is therwithall ſet foorth vnto vs, as the onelie foundation of faith &amp; repentance. And we muſt alſo note this, that wee do ſo begin repentance when we are turned vnto God, that we muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſecute the ſame during our life. Therefore this ſermon muſt continuallie ſound in the church, Repent: not that thoſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may begin the ſame, who will be counted faithfull, &amp; haue a place alreadie in the church but that they may goe forward in the ſame:<note place="margin">Mark. 1.15.</note> although manie do vſurpe the name of faithfull men, which had neuer any beginning of repentance. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt obſerue this order in teaching, that thoſe which do yet liue vnto the world &amp; the fleſh, may begin to crucifie the old man, that they may riſe vnto newneſſe of life: and that thoſe who are alredy entred the courſe of repentance, may continually go forward toward the mark. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, becauſe the inwarde conuerſion of the heart, ought to bring
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:7788:37"/> foorth frutes in the life, repentaunce cannot bee rightly taught, vnleſſe works be required: not thoſe friuolous workes, which are only in eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion amongſt the Papiſts, but ſuch as are ſound teſtimonies of innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and holineſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Be baptiſed euery one of you.</hi> Although in the text &amp; order of the words, Baptiſme doth here go before remiſſion of ſinnes: yet doth it folow it in order: becauſe it is nothing els but a ſealing of thoſe good things which we haue by Chriſt, that they may be eſtabliſhed in our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſciences. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore after that Peter had intreated of Repentance, he calleth the Iewes vnto the hope of grace &amp; ſaluation. And therefore Luke well afterwarde in Paul his ſermon, ioyneth faith and repentance together in the ſame ſenſe, wherein he putteth forgiueneſſe of ſinnes in this place. And that for good conſiderations. For the hope of ſaluation conſiſteth in the free imputation of rightuouſnes. And we are counted iuſt, freely before God, when he forgiueth vs our ſins. And as I ſaid before, that the doctrin of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance hath a daily vſe in the church, ſo muſt we think of the forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of ſins, that the ſame is continually offred vnto vs. And ſurely it is no leſſe neceſſary for vs during the whole courſe of our life, then at our firſt entrance into the church. So that it ſhould profit vs nothing, to be once receiued into fauour by God, vnleſſe this ambaſſage ſhould haue a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual courſe.<note place="margin">2. Cor. 5.20.</note> Be reconciled vnto God: bicauſe he which knew no ſinne, was made ſin for vs, that we might be the rightuouſneſſe of God in him. Moreouer, the Papiſts doe ſo corrupt this other part of the Goſpel: that they quite exclude the remiſſion of ſinnes, which was to be obtained by Chriſt. They confeſſe that ſinnes are freely forgiue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in baptiſme, but they will haue them redeemed with ſatisfactions after baptiſme: &amp; although they mix the grace of Chriſt together therwithall, yet becauſe they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrap the ſame in mens merits, they doe by this meanes ouerthrow the whole doctrin of the goſpel. For firſt they take fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mens conſciences the certaintie of faith: that done, foraſmuch as they part the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes between the death of Chriſt &amp; our ſatisfactions, they do altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther depriue vs of Chriſt his benefit. For Chriſt doth not reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cile vs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God in part, but wholy, neither can we obtain remiſſion of ſins by him vnleſſe it be whole &amp; perfect. But the papiſts are much deceiued therein who reſtrain baptiſm vnto the natiuitie &amp; former life, as if the ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion &amp; force therof did not reach euen vnto death. Let vs know therfore that forgiuenes of ſins is grounded in Chriſte alone, &amp; that we muſt not think vpon any other ſatisfaction ſaue only that which he hath perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the ſacrifice of his death. And for this cauſe as we haue alreadie ſaid, doth Peter expreſſe his name, wherby he doth ſignifie vnto vs, that none of all theſe things can be rightly taught, vnles Chriſt be ſet in the middeſt, to the end the effect of this doctrin may be ſought in him. That needeth no long expoſition, where he commandeth them to be baptiſed for the remiſſion of ſinnes. For althogh God hath once reconciled men vnto himſelf in Chriſt, by not imputing vnto them their ſinnes, and doth nowe imprint in our heartes the faith thereof by his Spirite: yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding becauſe baptiſme is the ſeale, whereby hee doth confirme
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:7788:37"/> vnto vs this benefite,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 5.19.</note> and ſo conſequently the earneſt and pledge of our adoption, it is worthilie ſaide to be giuen vs for the remiſſion of ſinnes. For becauſe we receiue Chriſts giftes by faith, and Baptiſme is a helpe to confirme and encreaſe our faith, remiſſion of ſinnes which is an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of faith is annexed vnto it, as vnto the inferiour meane. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more we muſt not fet the definition of baptiſme from this place, becauſe Peter doth onely touch a part thereof. Our old man is crucified by bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, as Paul teacheth, that we may riſe vnto newneſſe of life. Rom. 6. And againe, wee put on Chriſt himſelfe, 1. Cor. 12.<note place="margin">Rom. 6.4.6. Galat. 3.27.</note> and the Scripture teacheth euery where, that it is alſo a ſigne and token of repentance. But becauſe Peter doeth not intreat in this place openly of the whole nature of baptiſme, but ſpeaking of the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, doth by the way declare that the confirmation thereof is in baptiſme, there doth no inconuenience follow, if he do omit the other part.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the name of Christ.</hi> Although Baptiſme bee no vaine figure, but a true and effectuall teſtimonie: notwithſtanding leaſt any man attribute that vnto the element of water which is there offered, the name of Chriſt is plainly expreſſed, to the end we may know that it ſhalbe a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable ſigne for vs then, if we ſeeke the force and effect therof in Chriſt: and know that we are therefore waſhed in baptiſme, becauſe the bloode of Chriſt is our waſhing. And we doe alſo hereby gather, that Chriſt is the marke and end whereunto baptiſme directeth vs. Wherefore euery one profiteth ſo much in baptiſme, as he learneth to looke vnto Chriſt. But heere ariſeth a queſtion: Whether it were lawfull for Peter to change the forme preſcribed by Chriſt? The Papiſts do thinke, at leaſt feigne ſo, and thence do they take a colour of libertie, to chaunge or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brogate the inſtitutions of Chriſt. They confeſſe that nothing ought to be chaunged, as touching the ſubſtance: but they will haue the Church to haue libertie to chaunge whatſoeuer it will in the forme. But this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument may eaſily be anſwered. For we muſt firſt know that Chriſt did not indite and rehearſe vnto his Apoſtles magicall words for inchaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, as the Papiſts do dreame: but he did in fewe wordes comprehend the ſumme of the myſterie. Againe, I denie that Peter doth ſpeak in this place of the forme of baptiſme: but hee doeth ſimplie declare that the whole ſtrength of Baptiſme is contained in Chriſt. Although Chriſt can not be laid hold on by faith without the Father, by whom hee was giuen vs, and the Spirit, by the which he reneweth and ſanctifieth vs. The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere conſiſteth wholly in this, that hee intreateth not in this place of the certaine forme of baptiſing, but the faithfull are called backe vnto Chriſt, in whom alone we haue whatſoeuer baptiſme doth prefigure vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs. For we are both made cleane by his blood, and alſo we enter into a new life by the benefite of his death and reſurrection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Yee ſhall receiue the gift of the Spirit.</hi> Becauſe they were touched with wondering, when they ſaw the Apoſtles ſodainly beginne to ſpeake with ſtrange tongues: Peter ſaith that they ſhalbe partakers of the ſame gift, if they will paſſe ouer vnto Chriſt: Remiſſion of ſinnes, and newneſſe of life were the principall things: and this was as it were an addition, that
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:7788:38"/> Chriſt ſhould ſhew forth vnto them his power by ſome viſible gift. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ought this place to bee vnderſtoode of the grace of ſanctification which is giuen generally to all the Godlie. Therfore he promiſeth them the gift of the Spirite, whereof they ſawe a paterne in the diuerſitie of tongues. Therefore this doth not properly appertaine vnto vs. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt meant to ſet foorth the beginning of his kingdome with thoſe miracles, they laſted but for a time: yet becauſe the viſible graces which the Lord did diſtribute to his, did ſhewe as it were in a glaſſe that Chriſt was the giuer of the Spirite, therefore that which Peter ſaieth, doeth in ſome reſpect appertaine vnto all the whole Church: yee ſhall receiue the gift of the Spirit. For although wee doe not receiue it, that we may ſpeak with tongues:<note place="margin">Rom. 10.10 Iohn. 5.24.</note> that we may be prophets, that we may cure the ſicke, that wee may worke miracles: yet is it giuen vs for a better vſe, that we may beleeue with the heart vnto righteouſneſſe, that our tongues may bee framed vnto true confeſſion: that wee may paſſe from death to life: that we which are poore and emptie, may be made rich: that we may withſtande Sathan and the world ſtoutly. Therefore the grace of the Spirit ſhall alwayes be annexed vnto Baptiſme, vnleſſe the let be in our ſelues.</p>
               <p n="39">39 <hi>For the promiſe apperteineth vnto you.</hi> It was requiſite that this ſhoulde be expreſſely added, that the Iewes might certainly thinke and perſwade themſelues, that the grace of Chriſt did belong as wel to them as to the Apoſtles. And Peter prooueth it thus, becauſe the promiſe of God was made vnto them. For we muſt alwayes looke vnto this: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we cannot otherwiſe know the wil of God, ſaue onely by his word. But it is not ſufficient to haue the generall worde, vnleſſe wee knowe that the ſame is appointed for vs. Therefore Peter ſaith, that thoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites which they ſee in him and his fellowes in office, were in times paſt promiſed to the Iewes: becauſe this is required neceſſarilie for the certaintie of faith, that euery one be fully perſwaded of this, that hee is comprehended in the number of thoſe vnto whom God ſpeaketh. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, this is the rule of a true faith, when I am thus perſwaded, that ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation is mine, becauſe that promiſe appertaineth vnto me, which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth the ſame. And hereby we haue alſo a greater confirmation, when as the promiſe is extended vnto thoſe, who were before a farre off. For God had made the couenant with the Iewes. If the force and fruite thereof come alſo vnto the Gentiles, there is no cauſe why the Iewes ſhoulde doubt of themſelues, but that they ſhall finde the promiſe of God firme and ſtable.<note place="margin">Exod. 4.22. Gene. 17.7.</note> And we muſt note theſe three degrees, that the promiſe was firſt made to the Iewes, and then to their children, and laſt of all, that it is alſo to be imparted to the Gentiles. Wee know the reaſon why the Iewes are preferred before other people, for they are as it were the firſt begotten in Gods familie, yea they were then ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from other people by a ſingular priuiledge. Therefore Peter obſerueth a good order, when he giueth the Iewes the preheminence. Whereas hee adioyneth their children vnto them, it dependeth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the woordes of the promiſe: I will be thy God, and the God of thy
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:7788:38"/> ſeede after thee. Where God doeth reckon the children with the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in the grace of adoption. This place therefore doeth aboundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refute the manifeſt error of the Anabaptiſts, which will not haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants which are the children of the faithfull, to bee baptiſed, as if they were not members of the Church. They eſpie a ſtarting hole in the allegoricall ſenſe, and they expounde it thus, that by children are meant thoſe which are ſpirituallie begotten. But this groſſe impudency doth nothing helpe them. It is plaine and euident that Peter ſpake thus, becauſe God did addopt one nation peculiarly. And Circumciſion did declare that the right of adoption was common euen vnto infantes. Therefore euen as God made his couenant with Iſaach, being as yet vnborne, becauſe hee was the ſeede of Abraham: ſo Peter teacheth that all the children of the Iewes are contained in the ſame couenant, becauſe this promiſe is alwayes in force, I will bee the God of your ſeede.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And to thoſe which are a farre of.</hi> The Gentiles are named in the laſt place, which were before ſtraungers. For thoſe which referre it vnto thoſe Iewes, which were exiled a farre off and driuen into far countries, they are greatly diſceiued. For hee ſpeaketh not in this place of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of place: but hee noteth a difference betweene the Iewes and the Gentiles, that they were firſt ioyned to God by reaſon of the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and ſo conſequently became of his familie or houſholde: but the Gentiles were baniſhed from his kingdome. Paule vſeth the ſame ſpeech in the ſeconde Chapter to the Epheſians,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 2.11.</note> that the Gentiles which were ſtraungers from the promiſes, are nowe drawne neere through Ieſus Chriſt, vnto God. Becauſe that Chriſt (the wal of ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being taken away) hath reconciled both the Iewes &amp; Gentiles vnto the Father, and comming hee hath preached peace vnto thoſe which were nigh at hand, and which were a farre off. Nowe wee vnderſtande Peter his meaning. For to the end he may amplifie the grace of Chriſt, hee doeth ſo offer the ſame vnto the Iewes, that hee ſaieth the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles are alſo partakers thereof. And therefore hee vſeth this woorde <hi>Call,</hi> as if hee ſhoulde ſaie: Like as GOD hath gathered you togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into one peculiar people heretofore by his voyce, ſo the ſame voyce ſhall ſounde euerie where, that thoſe which are a farre off, may come and ioyne themſelues vnto you, when as they ſhall bee called by a new proclamation.</p>

                     <hi>40</hi> And with many other words did he testifie and exhort, ſaying: Bee yee ſaued from this froward generation.</p>

               </q>
               <p n="40">40 <hi>And with many.</hi> Although in theſe thinges which wee haue had hitherto, Luke did not recite the wordes of ſainct Peter, but did onelie
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:7788:39"/> briefly touch the chiefe points: notwithſtanding he telleth vs againe in this place, that Peter did not vſe doctrine onely, but did add the prickes of exhortations. And he expreſſeth plainely that he ſtoode much here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon. Whereas hee ſaith, that he did exhort and beſeech, hee noteth therein his earneſtneſſe. For it was not ſo eaſie a matter for them by and by to take their leaue of thoſe errours wherewith they were of late infected, and to ſhake off the gouernment of the Prieſts whereunto they were accuſtomed. Therefore it ſtood him vppon to pull them violentlie out of this myre. The ſumme was this, that they ſhould beware of that froward generation. For they could not be Chriſts vnleſſe they would depart from his profeſſed enimies. The Prieſts and Scribes were then in great authoritie, and for as much as they did couer themſelues vnder the viſure of the Church, they did deceiue the ſimple. This did hinder and keepe backe a great manie from comming to Chriſt. Alſo ſome might wauer, &amp; other ſome might fall away from the right faith. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Peter plainely declareth that they are a froward generation, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer they make boaſt of the title of the Church. For which cauſe hee commaundeth his hearers to ſeparate themſelues from them, leaſt they intangle themſelues in their wicked and peſtiferous fellowſhip. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he ſaith Be yee ſaued, hee ſignifieth vnto them that they ſhall ſurelie periſh, if they couple themſelues with ſuch a plague. And ſurely experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence doth teach vs how miſerablie thoſe men are toſſed to and fro, who cannot diſcerne the voice of their paſtour from the voyce of other men: and againe what an hinderance ſoftneſſe and ſluggiſheeſſe is to a great manie, whileſt they deſire to ſtande in a doubt. Therefore he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them to depart from the wicked, if they wil be ſaued. And this point of doctrine is not to bee neglected. For it were not ſufficient to haue Chriſt ſet before vs, vnles we were alſo taught to flie thoſe things which do lead vs away from him. And it is the dutie of a good ſhepheard to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend his ſheepe from the wolues. So at this day to the end we may keepe the people in the ſyncere doctrine of the Goſpel, we are euer nowe and then enforced to ſhew and teſtifie, howe much papiſtrie differeth from Chriſtianitie, and what a hurtfull plague it is to bee yoked with the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfull enimies of Chriſt. Neither ought Peter to be accuſed of railing, becauſe he calleth the reuerend fathers, who had the gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the Church in their hands at that day, a <hi>froward generation.</hi> For thoſe daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers which may drawe the ſoule vnto deſtruction, are to be ſhewed by their names. For men will not beware of poyſon, vnleſſe they know that it is poiſon.</p>
               <p n="41">41 <hi>They therefore which willingly.</hi> Luke ſheweth more plainely howe fruitfull this one ſermon which Peter made was: to wit, that it gained vnto Chriſt about three thouſand men. And therewithall he declareth the nature and force of faith, when he ſaith, that with a prompt and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die minde they embraced his word. Therefore faith muſt beginne with this readineſſe, and willing deſire to obey. But becauſe manie doe ſhew themſelues at the firſt verie willing, who afterward haue in themſelues no conſtancie or continuance: leaſt wee ſhould thinke that it was ſome
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:7788:39"/> ſodaine pange which by and by fell away, Luke doth alſo afterward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend their conſtancie, who (as he ſaid) did willingly embrace this word of the Apoſtles, ſhewing that they were ioyned vnto the diſciples, or that they were engrafted into the ſame bodie, and that they continued in their doctrine. Therefore we muſt neither be ſlow to obey, ne yet ſwift to leape backe: but we muſt ſticke faſt and ſtand ſtoutly to that doctrine which we did forthwith without any tariance embrace. Furthermore this example ought to make vs not a little aſhamed. For whereas there was a great multitude conuerted vnto Chriſt with one ſermon, an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſermons can ſcarce moue a few of vs: and whereas Luke ſaith that they continued, there is ſcarce one amongſt ten that doth ſhew euen a meane deſire to profite and goe forward, yea rather the more part doth ſoone loath our doctrine. Woe bee therefore to the ſluggiſhneſſe and lightnes of the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In their doctrine.</hi> Luke doth not onely commend in them the conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of faith or of godlineſſe: but he ſaieth alſo that they did conſtantly giue themſelues to thoſe exerciſes, which ſerue to the confirmation of faith: to wit, that they ſtudied continually to profite, by hearing the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles: that they gaue themſelues much to prayer: that they did vſe fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip and breaking of breade verie much: as touching praier and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, the ſenſe is plaine. <hi>Communication</hi> or fellowſhip, and <hi>breaking</hi> of bread may be taken diuerſly. Some thinke that breaking of breade doth ſignifie the Lords ſupper: otherſome do thinke that it ſignifieth almes: otherſome that the faithfull did banquet togither among themſelues. Some do thinke that <hi>coinonia</hi> doeth ſignifie the celebrating of the holie ſupper: but I do rather agree to thoſe others, who thinke that the ſame is meant by the breaking of bread. For <hi>Coinonia</hi> vnleſſe it haue ſomwhat added vnto it, is neuer found in this ſenſe. Therefore I do rather referre it vnto mutuall ſocietie and fellowſhip, vnto almes, and vnto other du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of brotherly fellowſhip. And my reaſon why I woulde rather haue breaking of bread to be vnderſtood of the Lords ſupper in this place, is this, becauſe Luke doth reckon vp thoſe thinges wherein the publike eſtate of the Church is contained. Yea, he expreſſeth in this place fower marks whereby the true and natural face of the Church may be iudged. Do we then ſeeke the true Church of Chriſt? The image thereof is liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly depainted and ſet forth vnto vs in this place. And he beginneth with doctrine which is as it were the ſoule of the Church. Neither doeth hee name all manner of doctrine, but the doctrine of the Apoſtles, that is, that which the ſonne of God had deliuered by their hands. Therefore whereſoeuer the pure voice of the Goſpell doth ſound, where men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in the profeſſion thereof, where they exerciſe themſelues in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the ſame ordinarily, that they may profite: without all doubt there is the Church. Hereby we may eaſily gather how friuolous the boaſting of the Papiſts is, whiles that they careleſly thunder out with full mouth the name of the Church: whereas notwithſtanding they haue moſt fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily corrupted the doctrine of the Apoſtles. For if it be duly examined, we ſhall finde no ſound part at all: and in moſt points they do as much
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:7788:40"/> diſſent from the ſame, and haue as little agreement therewith, as light with darkeneſſe. The rule of worſhipping God, which ought to bee fet out of the pure worde of God alone, is onely made and patcht togither amongſt the papiſts, of the ſuperſtitious inuentions of men. They haue tranſlated vnto the merites of workes, the hope of ſaluation which ought to haue reſted in Chriſt alone. The inuocation of God is altogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther polluted with innumerable profane dotinges of men. Finallie, whatſoeuer is heard amongſt them, it is either a deforming of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles doctrine, or elſe a cleere ouerthrowing and deſtroying of the ſame. Therefore we may as eaſily refute the fooliſh arrogancie of the papiſts, as they can cloake their dealings with the title of the Church. For this ſhall bee the ſtate: whether they haue retained the puritie of doctrine, from which they are as farre as Hell is from Heauen. But they are wiſe ynough in that point, becauſe they will haue no controuerſie moued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout doctrine. But wee as I haue ſaid, may freely contemne that vaine viſure: foraſmuch as the Spirit of God doth pronounce, that the Church is principallie to bee eſteemed and diſcerned by this marke, if the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie or puritie of the doctrine deliuered by the Apoſtles doe floriſh and be of force in the ſame.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In fellowſhip.</hi> This member and the laſt doe flowe from the firſt, as fruites or effectes. For doctrine is the bonde of brotherlie fellowſhip a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt vs, and doth alſo ſet open vnto vs the gate, vnto God, that wee may call vppon him. And the ſupper is added vnto doctrine in ſteede of a confirmation. Wherefore Luke doeth not in vaine recken vp theſe fowre thinges, when as hee will deſcribe vnto vs the well ordered ſtate of the Church. And wee muſt endeuour to keepe and obſerue this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if we will bee truely iudged to bee the Church, before God and the Angels, and not onely to make boaſt of the name thereof amongſt men. It is certaine that he ſpeaketh of publike praier.

When there ariſeth any ſect, all men ſet themſelues ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt the ſame: and as noueltie is odious, the Iewes woulde neuer haue ſuffered the Church of Chriſt to ſtande one minuite of an houre, vnleſſe the Lorde had reſtreined them with feare as with a bridle. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore Luke noteth the manner of feare, that it was no ſuch feare
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:7788:40"/> as bringeth men vnto the obedience of Chriſt, but ſuch as cauſeth men to ſtande in a doubt, and ſo conſequently doth as it were ſo binde them hande and foote, that they dare not hinder the Lordes worke. Like as there be ſome at this day, who will willingly be ignorant of the Goſpel: or at leaſt are ſo holden with the cares of this worlde, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not throughly ioyne themſelues vnto Chriſt: and yet they are not ſo harde hearted, but that they confeſſe that the trueth is on our ſide: and therefore the reſt is as it were in the midde way, neither doe they fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour the crueltie of the wicked, becauſe they are afraid to ſtriue againſt God. And whereas hee ſaith, Euery ſoule, he ſpeaketh thus by Synec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doche. For it is certaine that many did contemne the hande of God: and that otherſome were ſtriken with no great feare, but that they did furiouſlie rage togither againſt the Church. But Luke his meaning was this, that there appeared ſuch power of God in the Church, that the people for the moſt part had not one word to ſay.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And many woonders.</hi> This member ſerueth alſo to the ſhewing of the cauſe. For the miracles ſerued to make them afraide togither with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther workes of God: although this was not the onely reaſon, but one of many, why they were afraid to ſet themſelues againſt God, who was on that ſide, as they did gather by the myracles: whence wee gather that they are not onely profitable for this, to bring men to God, but alſo to make the wicked ſomewhat more gentle, and that they may tame their furiouſneſſe. Pharao was a man of deſperate ſtubbernes,<note place="margin">Exo. 8.8. &amp;c 19.</note> and yet wee ſee how miracles doe ſometime pearce his obſtinate heart. He forgetteth them by and by, but when the hand of God is heauie vppon him, hee is compelled through feare to yeelde. To bee briefe, Luke teacheth that the Iewes were by this meanes kept backe, that the Church which might eaſilie haue beene deſtroied, might haue got vp her heade. Which thing wee haue oftentimes tried euen in our time. And he doth not onely declare that they were bridled with feare, leaſt they ſhoulde bee ſo bolde as to attempt ſo much as they luſted to doe hurt to the Church, but that they were alſo humbled with reuerence to the glorie of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p n="44">44 <hi>And all.</hi> Whereas I haue tranſlated it <hi>ioyned togither,</hi> it is worde for worde in ſaint Luke, Into the ſame, or into one, which may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of the place: as if hee ſhould haue ſaide that they were wont to dwell togither in one place. Notwithſtanding I had rather vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande it of their conſent and agreement: as hee will ſay in the fourth Chapter, That they had one heart.<note place="margin">Actes. 4.32.</note> And ſo hee goeth forwarde or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derlie, when as he beginneth with their minde. Hee addeth afterward their bountifulneſſe, as a fruite proceeding thence. Therefore hee gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs to vnderſtande, that they were rightly ioyned togither with brotherlie loue amongſt themſelues, and that they did in deede de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the ſame, becauſe the rich men did ſell their goods that they might help the poore. And this is a ſingular example of loue, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth Luke recorde the ſame, to the ende wee may knowe that wee muſt releeue the pouertie of our brethren with our plentie.</p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:7788:41"/>
               <p>But this place hath neede of a ſound expoſition, becauſe of fantaſticall ſpirits, which do feigne a communalty or participation togither of gods, whereby all policie or ciuile gouernment is taken away: as in this age the Anabaptiſts haue raged, becauſe they thought there was no Church vnleſſe all mens goods were put and gathered togither, as it were in one heape, that they might all, one with another take thereof. Wherefore we muſt in this point beware of two extremes. For many vnder colour of policie, doe keepe cloſe and conceale whatſoeuer they haue, they defraude the poore, and they thinke that they are twiſe righteous, ſo they take away no other mens goods. Otherſome are caried into the contrary errour, becauſe they would haue all things confuſed. But what doth Luke? Surely he noteth another order, when hee ſaieth, that there was choiſe made in the diſtribution. If any man obiect, that no man had any thing which was his owne, ſeeing all things were common, we may eaſily anſweare. For this communitie or participation togither muſt be reſtreined vnto the circumſtance which inſueth immediatly: to wit, that the poore might be relieued as euery man had neede. We know the olde prouerbe, All things are common amongſt friends. when as the ſcholers of Pythagoras ſaide thus, they did not denie but that euery man might gouerne his owne houſe priuatly, neither did they intend to make their owne wiues common. So that this hauing of thinges common, whereof Luke ſpeaketh, and which he commendeth, doeth not take away houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold gouernment: which thing ſhall better appeare by the fourth chap. where as he nameth two alone which ſold their poſſeſſions, of ſo manie thouſands. Whence we gather that which I ſaide euen nowe, that they brought forth and made common their goods in no other reſpect, ſaue onely that they might relieue the preſent neceſſitie. And the impuden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of the Monkes was ridiculous, who did profeſſe that they did obſerue the Apoſtles rule, becauſe they call nothing their owne: and yet neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe they neither ſell any thing, neither yet doe they paſſe for anie mans pouertie: but they ſtuffe their idle bellies with the bloode of the poore, neither do they regard any other thing in their hauing of things common, ſaue onely that they may be wel filled and daintilie, although all the whole worlde be hungrie. Wherein then are they like to the firſt diſciples, with whom they will be thought to be able to compare?</p>

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:7788:41"/> to haue the Temple in any ſuch reuerence: but becauſe there was there great concourſe of people, who hauing laide aſide their priuate cares, wherewith they had beene drawne away elſe where, did ſeeke the Lorde: they were continually in the Temple, that they might gaine ſuch vnto Chriſt. There might be another reaſon which might induce them hereunto, that they might haue a mutuall conference and imparting of doctrine amongſt themſelues: which they could not haue done ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniently in a priuate houſe, eſpecially ſeeing they were ſo many.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Breaking bread from houſe to houſe.</hi> Luke ſignifieth vnto vs that they did not only ſhew ſome token of true godlines, publikely, but that the courſe &amp; tenor of their priuate life was al one in that reſpect. For whereas ſome doe thinke that in this place, by breaking of breade is meant the holie ſupper, it ſeemeth to me that Luke meant no ſuch thing. He ſignifieth therefore vnto vs that they vſed to eate togither, and that thriftily. For thoſe which make ſumptuous banquets, do not eat their meat togither ſo familiarly. Againe Luke addeth, <hi>In ſinglenes</hi> of heart. Which is alſo a token of temperance. In ſumme, his meaning is to declare that their manner of liuing, was brotherly and ſober. Some doe ioyne ſimplicitie &amp; gladneſſe with the praiſe of God: and both texts may well bee allowed. But becauſe there can be no ſingleneſſe of heart in praiſing God, vnleſſe the ſame be alſo in all parts of the life, therefore it is certaine that there is mention made thereof in this ſenſe, that the faithfull did alwayes vſe the ſame in al places. And we muſt alſo note the circumſtance of time, that being enuironed and beſet with many dangers, they were merie &amp; ioyfull. The knowledge of Gods loue toward vs, and the hope of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection do bring vs this goodneſſe with them, that we praiſe God with quiet minds, whatſoeuer the worlde doth threaten. And as Luke ſpake a little before of the publike eſtate of the Church, ſo he declareth nowe what forme and manner of life the faithfull did vſe: that we may learne by their example a thriftie fellowſhip in our manner of liuing, and in all our whole life to embrace ſingleneſſe, to enioy the ſpirituall ioy, and to exerciſe our ſelues in the praiſes of God. Furthermore, the ſingle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of heart reacheth farre: but if you ioyne it in this place with brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of breade, it ſhall ſignifie as much as ſyncere loue, where one man dealeth plainely with an other, neither doeth any man craftilie hunt after his owne profite. Yet had I rather ſet the ſame againſt that care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, wherewith worldly men do too too much torment themſelues. For when as wee doe not caſt our care vppon the Lorde, this rewarde hangeth ouer our heads, that we tremble and quake euen when we take our reſt.</p>

And yet wee neede not to doubt of this, but that they were hated of manie. But although hee ſpeake generallie of the people, yet he meaneth that part alone which was ſound, neither yet infected with any poiſon of hatred. Hee ſignifieth briefely that the faithfull did ſo behaue themſelues, that the people did full well like of them for their innocencie of life.</p>

And although they did all of them ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly labour to encreaſe the kingdome of Chriſt, yet Luke aſcribeth this honour to God alone, that he brought ſtraungers into the Church.

                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:7788:42"/>1 We ſaw before that many ſignes were ſhewed by the hands of the Apoſtles: nowe Luke reciteth one of many for examples ſake, after his common cuſtome: namely, that a lame man, which was lame of his feete from his mothers wombe, was perfectly reſtored to his limmes. And he doeth diligently gather all the circumſtances which ſerue to ſet forth the myracle. If it had ben that his legges had bene out of ioynt, or if it had beene ſome diſeaſe comming by ſome caſualtie, it might haue beene the more eaſily cured. But the default of nature coulde not haue beene ſo eaſilie redreſſed. When as hee ſaieth that hee was carried, we gather thereby that it was no light halting, but that this man did lie as if his legges had beene deade. Foraſmuch as he was woont daily to aske almes, heereby all the people might the better know him. In that being healed, he walketh in the Temple at the time of praier, this ſerued to ſpread abroad the fame of the miracle. Furthermore this doth not a litle ſet forth the ſame, that being lift vp and ſet vpon his feete, he leapeth vp therewithall, and walketh ioyfully.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Went vp togither.</hi> Becauſe theſe words <hi>epi to auto,</hi> doth no more ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie place than time, this latter ſenſe ſeemeth better to agree with the text of Peter, yet becauſe it is of no great importance, I leaue it indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent. That is called the ninth houre of prayer, when as the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to drawe towards night. For ſeeing the day from the riſing of the ſunne vnto the going downe thereof, had twelue houres, as I haue ſaide elſe where, all that time was deuided into foure partes. So that by the ninth, is meant the laſt portion of the day: as the firſt houre did conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue vnto the third, the third vnto the ſixt, the ſixt vnto the ninth. Hence may we gather by a probable coniecture, that that houre was appointed for the euening ſacrifice. Furthermore if any man aske, whether the Apoſtles went vp into the Temple that they might pray according to the rite of the law: I do not think that that is a thing ſo likely to be true, as that they might haue better oportunity to ſpread abroad the Goſpel. And if any man will abuſe this place, as if it were lawfull for vs to vſe and take vp ſuperſtitious worſhippings, whileſt that wee are conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant amongſt the ignorant and weake, his reaſon ſhall bee friuolous. The Lorde appointed that the Iewes ſhoulde offer ſacrifice, morning and euening. By this exerciſe were they taught,<note place="margin">Exod. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>9.41 Num. 28.2.</note> to beginne and end the day with calling vppon the name of God, and with worſhipping him. Therefore Peter and Iohn might freelie come into the Temple, which was conſecrated to God: neither did they pollute themſelues, ſeeing they called vppon the God of Iſrael, that they might thereby declare their Godlineſſe. Firſt in that the Lorde woulde haue the olde peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to obſerue the appointed houres: wee gather thereby that the Church cannot bee without certaine Diſcipline. And euen at this day were it profitable for vs to haue ſuch meetings daily, vnleſſe our too too much ſluggiſhneſſe did let vs. And whereas the Apoſtles go vppe at that houre, heereby wee gather that wee muſt foreſlowe no opportunitie that is offered vs for the furtherance of the Goſpel.</p>

                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:7788:43"/>3 <hi>He asketh an almes.</hi> We ſee how God reſtored this lame man to his limbes contrarie to his expectation. Becauſe he thought that his diſeaſe was incurable, hee was onely carefull for maintenance. That is giuen him which he durſt neuer haue asked. In like ſort God doth oftentimes preuent vs, neither doth he ſtay vntill he be prouoked. And hence can we not gather any occaſion of ſlouthfulneſſe, as if the Lorde did there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore meete vs of his owne accorde, that being idle and ſlothfull we may ſuffer the Lord to doe good vnto vs. For wee are commaunded to praie, and therefore let vs not foreſlowe our duetie. But firſt of all vnder the perſon of the lame man, wee haue ſet before vs an example of a man that is not yet illuminated by faith, that hee may know howe to pray a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right. Such doeth God preuent as it is needefull, euen of his owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde. Therefore when as he reſtoreth our ſoules not onely to health, but alſo to life, hee himſelfe is to himſelfe the cauſe heereof. For this is the beginning of our calling, that hee may make thoſe thinges to bee which are not:<note place="margin">Rom. 4.17.</note> that he may ſhew himſelfe vnto thoſe who ſeeke not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him. Furthermore howſoeuer wee bee alreadie taught by faith to praie vnto God, yet becauſe wee doe not alwayes feele our miſeries, it commeth not into our minde to ſeeke for remedie: therefore the Lord bringeth the ſame freelie and vnlooked for. Finallie howſoeuer we bee bent to pray, yet doeth hee exceede our hope and petitions with his goodneſſe.</p>
               <p n="4">4 <hi>Looke vpon vs.</hi> Peter doth not thus ſpeake, before he be certaine of the purpoſe and intent of God. And ſurely in theſe words he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth him to hope for ſome ſingular and vnwoonted benefite: yet heere may a queſtion be mooued, Whether they had power to worke myra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles ſo often as they would. I anſwere that they were miniſters of Gods power in ſuch ſort, that they did attempt nothing of their owne will or proper motion, but the Lorde wrought by them, when he knewe that it was expedient it ſhoulde be ſo. Heereby it came to paſſe that they hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led one and not all. Therefore as in other things they had the Spirite of God to be their guide and directer, ſo alſo in this point. Therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch time as Peter commaundeth the lame man to ariſe, hee did caſt and faſten his eyes vpon him. This ſtedfaſt looking vpon him, was not without ſome peculiar motion of the Spirite. Hereby it commeth to paſſe, that he ſpeaketh ſo ſurely and ſafely without al feare of the myra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle. Furthermore hee meant by this worde to prouoke the lame man to receiue the grace of God: yet doeth hee looke for nothing but for an almes.</p>
               <p n="6">6 <hi>Siluer and gold.</hi> Peter doeth truely excuſe himſelfe, that hee doeth want that helpe which the lame man did require. And therefore doeth hee declare that if hee were able to relieue his pouertie hee woulde willingly doe it: like as euery man ought to conſider with himſelfe what the Lorde hath giuen him, that hee may therewith helpe his neighbours. For what ſtore ſo euer God giueth to euerie man, hee will haue the ſame to bee an inſtrument and helpe to exerciſe loue. Therefore hee ſaieth that hee giueth that which hee hath. This was
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:7788:43"/> at the firſt a tricke of mockage, in that Peter beginneth to ſpeake of his pouertie, after that he had brought the lame man into a rare hope, as if he meant to mocke a gaping crowe: but he comforteth him immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly, to the end the miracle might bee had in greater eſtimation by the compariſon. That is horrible wickedneſſe, in that the Pope, when as he is created, doeth moſt vnſhamefaſtly abuſe this place, making thereof a comicall or rather a ſcoffing play. There bee two Celles or places made of ſtone, in the one whereof when hee ſitteth, and the people aske an almes, vſing theſe wordes of Peter, hee caſteth abroade croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in the aire with his fingers.

                  <hi>In the name of Ieſu.</hi> Hee ſaieth that this is the worke and benefite of Chriſt, that hee reſtoreth to the creeple the vſe of his feete, for Name is taken for power and empire or gouernment.

For this ought to haue beene, and was his care, that Chriſt might bee made knowne vnto the worlde, and that his name might bee ſanctified. But why doeth hee giue Chriſt this Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thete or title <hi>of Nazareth?</hi> I leaue to other men their owne iudgment: but I thinke thus: For as much as Chriſt was thus called in contempt, Peter meant of ſet purpoſe to expreſſe that that Ieſus of Nazareth whom they had crucified, and whoſe name was diſpiſed and without glorie amongſt the Iewes, and was to the moſt of them deteſtable, was neuertheleſſe the Meſſias promiſed of God, and that all power was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto him of the father: as Paul ſaith,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 2.2.</note> that he preacheth Chriſt and him crucified.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ariſe and walke.</hi> This might ſeeme to be a very ridiculous thing. For the Creeple might haue readilie obiected, Why haſt thou not firſt gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen mee legges and feete? For this is a plaine mocke, when as thou biddeſt a man without feete, to goe. But he beleeued Peter his words: and hee which was at the firſt ſo ſlowe, doeth nowe with a readie and ioyfull minde embrace Gods benefite. Whereby appeareth both the force of the worde, and alſo the fruite of faith. The force of the worde is double, both in that the Creeple is ſo touched, that hee doth forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with obey without any delay: and in that it giueth ſtrength to his dead members, and doeth after a ſort renew the man. And faith alſo hath her rewarde, in that the creeple obeyeth him which commaunded him to riſe not in vaine. Therefore wee ſee how God worketh by his worde,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:7788:44"/> to wit, when hee giueth ſucceſſe to the preaching thereof, that it may pearce into the mindes of men: ſecondly when he giueth thoſe thinges with his hand, which are promiſed there: moreouer hee ſuffereth not faith to be voide, but ſhee doeth in deede truely enioy all thoſe good thinges, which ſhee looketh for, and which are offered vnto her in the ſame worde. And we muſt remember that which I haue alreadie ſaide, that wee haue in this hiſtorie a type or figure of our ſpirituall reſtoring: namely, that as the word laid holde on by faith, did reſtore the Creeple to his limbes, ſo the Lorde pearceth into our ſoules by the worde, that he may reſtore the ſame. And firſt of all he ſpeaketh by mans mouth, and pricketh vs forward vnto the obedience of faith: that done he mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth our hearts inwardly by his ſpirite, that the worde may take liuelie roote in vs: finally hee reacheth out his hande, and by all meanes he fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth his worke in vs. We gather out of Matthew that miracles muſt be thus handled.</p>
               <p n="9">9 <hi>And all the people ſaw.</hi> He beginneth now to declare the fruit of the miracle, to wit, that the creeple began to ſhewe his thankfulneſſe, by praiſing God, and that all the people were brought into great woonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. And heere is a double fruite. For hee which was healed, doeth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge and ſet forth the benefite of God, on the other ſide the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is mooued, and the ſame is ſpread abroad, many come to ſee it. And where as Luke ſaith, that they were filled with woondring, it doth one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declare a preparation, which a more ful proceeding &amp; going forward did at length follow. For it was neceſſary that they ſhould go forwarde, becauſe this their woondring had ferued to no ende of it ſelfe, but did rather make them aſtonied and amazed, than bring them from their owne proceedings vnto God.</p>
               <p>Therefore it was as it were the foundation of the building which was to come, in that the people was touched with amazednes. For if we paſſe ouer the works of God contemptiblie or careleſly, we ſhal neuer be able to profit by them. Furthermore this place doth teach vs, what myracles do work of themſelues in men: to wit, that they breede a confuſed ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zedneſſe. For although the Lord doth call vs ſtreightway vnto himſelfe by ſhewing plainely his goodnes and power there, yet ſuch is the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of our nature that wee ſtumble or faint in the midway, vntill ſuch time as we bee holpen by doctrine. Let vs therefore learne reuerentlie to conſider the workes of God, that the woondring at them, may make an entrance for doctrine. For when doctrine is colde and vnprofitable with vs, God doeth iuſtly puniſh our vnthankefulneſſe by this meanes, becauſe we haue deſpiſed the glorie of his workes. Againe becauſe wee are not ſo quicke of ſight, that wee can ſee ſo much in the workes of God alone, as is ſufficient, let vs learne to ioyne therewithall the helpe of doctrine. To be briefe, the one ought not to be ſeparated from the other. Which thing experience doth ſufficiently teach vs. For heereby it came to paſſe that the worlde did ſo wickedlie abuſe myracles. The Papiſtes doe obiect vnto vs myracles againe and againe. Let vs ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that they bee true, whereof they make ſuch boaſt, yet doe they
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:7788:44"/> greatly erre in this, that they wreſt them to a wrong ende: to wit, that they may darken the name of God, and infect the pure trueth of the Goſpel with their inuentions. For, whence come ſo many ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous worſhipings of ſaintes, ſaue onely from the abuſe of miracles? For when any myracle is wrought, men muſt needs bee mooued. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are deafe when they ſhoulde heare the word, and doe not marke what God doth meane, Sathan doeth craftily take an occaſion of ſuperſtition by our amaſedneſſe. As for example: I will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the power of God in a myracle. If it were wrought by Peter, Sathan will by and by put this in my heade, and will ſay thus: Doeſt thou not ſee that this is a man of God? therefore thou doeſt owe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him diuine honour. The ſame thing had befallen the Iewes when they were amaſed, vnleſſe Peter his ſermon had called them backe into the right way. But in poperie where none did cal them backe or reproue them, the prepoſterous woondering of men did eaſily get the vpper hande. Wherefore wee muſt ſo much the more ſeeke for medicine out of the worde, that doctrine may direct vs vnto the right ende, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lifted vp with the myracles.</p>

As if hee ſhoulde ſay, Yee doe amiſſe, in that you ſtay in vs, and ſtande gaſing vppon vs, whereas you ought rather to looke vppon God and Chriſt. Therefore this is to be amaſed euillie, when as our mindes doe ſtaie in men. And wee muſt note that hee condemneth the reſpect of men. As if, ſaieth hee, wee by our owne power and vertue had done this. Therefore there is an errour and corruption in this, if wee attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute that vnto the godlineſſe and power of men, which is proper to God and Chriſt. And as concerning power, no man will denie that it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth of God: yet when they haue confeſſed this in one worde, they do not ceaſe to take from God his right, to the ende they may adorne the creatures with that which they take from him. As wee ſee the Papiſtes place the power of God, in the Saintes: yea they include his power in a ſtone or ſtocke of woode, ſo ſoone as the image is conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated to Barbara or Chryſogonus. But notwithſtanding let vs ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that they doe not offende in that former member. Yet doe they fooliſhly thinke that they haue done their duetie toward God, when as they leaue him the power: and aſſigne the myracles vnto the godlines of Saints. For why doe they runne vnto them, when they will obtaine either raine or faire weather, or bee deliuered from diſeaſes, vnleſſe they doe imagine that they haue by their godlineſſe deſerued, that God ſhoulde graunt them this right and priuiledge? This is therefore but a childiſh ſtarting hole, when they confeſſe that God is the author of the power: but they thanke the godlineſſe of Saintes for thoſe bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites which they haue receiued. Howſoeuer they colour the matter, we muſt alwayes knowe this, that Peter doeth generally condemne thoſe which doe ſo looke vnto men in myracles, that they thinke that their holineſſe is the cauſe thereof. This is the firſt part of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, wherein hee reprooueth ſuperſtition. And wee muſt note this maner and order of teaching. For becauſe men are enclined to nothing more, than to fall from God vnto the Creatures, it is verie expedient to preuent this vice in time. And if the people were forbidden to looke vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Apoſtles, much more doth the Spirit drawe vs away from calling vpon euerie petie Saint.</p>
               <p n="13">13. 14. <hi>The God of Abraham.</hi> Hee addeth a remedie nowe, in calling them backe vnto Chriſt.

Whereuppon it followeth that all thoſe doe deale diſorderlie, who ſet vp Peter or any other whatſoeuer hee bee, for ſo much as all men muſt decreaſe, and Chriſt alone muſt bee excellent.

               <p>He maketh mention of the God of Abraham, Iſaach, and Iacob, to the ende he may declare vnto the people, that hee meaneth nothing leſſe, than to lead them away from the old and auncient worſhip of the true God, which they had receiued of the Fathers. Furthermore, God hath giuen himſelfe this title, that he might diſſeuer and diſtinguiſh himſelf by ſome marke from Idols. For wee doe not comprehend God in his eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence which cannot be ſeen, and which is infinite. Therefore hee vſeth ſuch meanes as agree beſt with vs, to bring vs to the knowledge of him. The Turkes doe boaſt that they do worſhip God, which is the Creator of heauen and earth: but before they come at heauen, they vaniſh away. Therefore to the end God might keepe his people from vaine and erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious inuentions, he kept them in his couenant. Therfore when he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth himſelfe the God of Abraham,<note place="margin">Deut. 30.12</note> he did briefly teach that which Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes declareth more at large: Say not, Who ſhall aſcend into heauen? who ſhall goe downe into the depth? Or who ſhall ſaile ouer the Seas? The worde is nigh, &amp;c. Furthermore, as amongeſt the Iewes the name of the holy Fathers was in high eſtimation: ſo Peter doth cloſely tel them, that they were no better than other men, without the only begotten ſonne of God. And at this day God will bee knowen by a more euident marke yet, when as he calleth himſelfe the Father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. Let vs now returne vnto Peter. He ſaith that he bringeth in no new religion, that he may draw away the people from the law and the Prophets. For if he ſhould attempt this, God had forbidden them to heare him.<note place="margin">Deut. 13.3. 1. Cor. 3.11.</note> Deut. 13. Like as Paule teacheth, that we muſt retaine one foundation in the ſpirituall building: becauſe ſo ſoone as we depart euen but a little from Chriſt, there can nothing enſue but ruine. And hereby alſo we may eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie diſcern in what ſenſe he calleth God the god of the Fathers. For nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth he take this for a generall <hi>maxime:</hi> that what manner worſhip ſoeuer the fathers had, wee muſt continue the ſame: as the Papiſts doe fooliſhly vaunt, that they doe follow the manner of worſhipping, whiche was vſed amongeſt the fathers. For Peter doth expreſly reckon vppe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, Iſaach, and Iacob, from whom true religion did proceed, and by whom it was diuinely deliuered, whereby hee doeth ſignifie vnto vs, that we muſt not follow all fathers: whereof manie did growe out of kinde, and became altogether vnlike to the firſt fathers, that this honor is due to the children of God alone, and that others are to bee refuſed.<note place="margin">Eze. 20.18.</note> Which thing the Prophets doe alſo beat in euerie where: Walk not in the waies of your fathers, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whom ye haue deliuered.</hi> Hee mingleth with doctrine a moſt ſharpe chiding, according as the matter did require. For it was vnpoſſible to bring them truly vnto God, vnleſſe they were firſt brought to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of their ſinnes. Neither doth he only lightly touch them, but hee doeth very grauely ſhewe them the horribleneſſe of that offence, which they had committed. To this ende tendeth that compariſon, that they deliuered him to be put to death, whom Pilate would haue looſed. And againe, that pardoning a murtherer, they put the prince of life to death: that they did reiect the iuſt &amp; holy. Men muſt bee ſo ſtricken, that being
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:7788:46"/> brought to knowe their giltines, they may earneſtly flie vnto the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of pardon. Such vehemencie and earneſtneſſe did Peter alſo vſe in his firſt ſermon. He ſaith afterward that God raiſed him vppe. Whereby they ought to know, that in putting Chriſte to death, they did ſtriue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God. Although Peter had reſpect vnto an higher thing: to wit, that their crueltie did no whit impayre the glory of Chriſt becauſe God had neuertheleſſe reſtored him to life. When as he ſaith, that he and his fellowes in office were witneſſes of the reſurrection, his meaning is, that they ſaw it with their eyes.<note place="margin">Luk. 24.48.</note> Therefore this is referred not onely vnto the Apoſtolicall function: but becauſe they ſaw Chriſte with their eyes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that hee was riſen from the dead. Although I doe alſo graunt that this ſeconde thing is comprehended vnder theſe wordes: Becauſe it is likely that Peter doeth make mention of that function which was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted vnto him, to the ende hee may purchaſe the greater autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.</p>
               <p n="16">16 <hi>And in the faith of his name.</hi> When as he ſaith, In the faith of his name, and His name, and again, The faith which is by him: this repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is a token of a feruent affection. For becauſe hee was wholie giuen to ſet foorth the glorie of Chriſte, hee beateth in the ſame thing often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times. Moreouer wee ſee that when Paule is occupied about the ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſetting foorth of the grace of Chriſt: he thinketh that he hath neuer ſpoken enough touching the ſame. And ſurely, ſuch is the wicked nature of men, that Chriſt cannot be ſo highly extolled, &amp; ſo preached, that his honour can remaine ſounde vnto him. Let vs therefore remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that Peter did vſe ſuch varietie and plentie of wordes, to the ende he might ſtay vs in Chriſt. As touching the phraſe, when as he ſaith, <hi>his name, in the faith of his name hath ſtrengthened,</hi> hee ſheweth both the cauſe &amp; the maner. The power of Chriſt had healed the Creeple, but by faith. When as he ſaith, the <hi>faith</hi> which is by him, by this worde hee ſignifieth vnto vs, that our faith cannot ariſe vp vnto God, vnleſſe it bee grounded in Chriſt, and ſo conſequentlie that this our faith doth look vnto Chriſt and ſtay it ſelfe vpon him, and ſo he ſheweth that there can bee no right faith in God, when we paſſe ouer this meane.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, as he ſaid before, that he and the other Apoſtles were witneſſes of Chriſtes life: ſo he doth nowe declare that this life was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly proued vnto the Iewes by a ſigne or effect: becauſe they ſee the creeple healed, in whom they hadde an excellent and euident token of the diuine power of Chriſt. And when as in this laſt member he maketh faith the cauſe of this ſoundneſſe, hee layeth vnthankfulneſſe to their charge by the way, vnleſſe they giue faith her due prayſe. And although faith may be referred as well vnto the man that was healed, as vnto the Apoſtles, yet we neede not to ſtand much about this matter, becauſe the power of the Goſpel is ſet foorth by <hi>Synecdoche.</hi>

We muſt alſo remember that which we ſawe elswhere, leaſt there ſhould any falſe and abſurde opinion creep in, that Chriſt was laid open to the luſt of the wicked, that God is made the chiefe authour, by whoſe wil his only ſonne did ſuffer.</p>
               <p n="19">19 <hi>Repent.</hi> We muſt note that when he exhorteth vnto repentance he doth alſo declare that there is remiſſion of ſinnes prepared for them before the face of God. For as I ſaid of late, no man can be ſtirred vp to repentance, vnleſſe he haue ſaluation ſet before him, But he which doth deſpaire of pardon, being as it were giuen ouer vnto deſtruction already doth not feare to runne headlong againſt God obſtinately. Heereby it commeth to paſſe that the Papiſts cannot deliuer the doctrine of repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. They babble indeed very much concerning the ſame: but becauſe they ouerthrow the hope of grace, it cannot bee that they ſhoulde per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade their diſciples vnto the ſtudie of repentance. Moreouer I confeſſe that they babble a little touching forgiuenes of ſinnes: but becauſe they leaue mens ſoules in dout and in fearefulneſſe, and furthermore do caſt them as it were into a Labyrinth, or place out of which they knowe not how to come, this part of the doctrine being corrupt, they confound the other alſo.</p>
               <p n="20">20 <hi>That when.</hi> If we followe Eraſmus and the olde interpreter, this ſentence ſhalbe vnperfect, which may be made perfect, thus. When the time of refreſhing ſhall come, you may alſo enioy this refreſhing. When Chriſt ſhall come to iudge the world, you may find him a redeemer and not a iudge. But becauſe Beza doth fitly tranſlate it, After that they ſhal come: it is better to retaine that which is not ſo rackt: ſo you reſolue it thus: that ſinnes are forgiuen againſt the day of the laſt iudgement: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe vnleſſe we be cited to appere before Gods iudgement ſeat, we are not greatly carefull to pacifie God. Firſt of all we muſt note, that he ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth before them the day of iudgement, to the end the former exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may take the greater effect. For there is nothing which doth more prick vs, than when we are taught that we muſt once giue an account. For ſo long as our ſenſes are holden &amp; kept in this world, they are drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as it were in a certain drowſines, that I may ſo call it. Wherfore the meſſage of the laſt iudgement muſt ſound as a trumpet to cite vs to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare before the iudgement ſeat of God. For then at laſt being trulie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waked we begin to think of a new life. In like ſort when Paule preached at Athens: God ſaith that he doth now wil all men to repent: becauſe he
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:7788:47"/> hath appointed a day wherein he will iudge the worlde. The ſumme is this, that Chriſte who is now vnto vs a maſter, when as hee teacheth vs by the Goſpell, is appointed of the Father to be a iudge, and ſhall come in his due time: and that therefore we muſt obey his doctrine betimes, that we may gather the frute of our faith then. But ſome man may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, that Peter ſpeaketh otherwiſe of the laſt day. For this doeth not ſerue to make them afraid, when he ſaith, <hi>the time of refreſhing.</hi> I anſwere, that there is a double prick, wherewith the faithful are pricked forward when as they are told of the laſt iudgement. For the profite of faith doth not appeare in this worlde, yea rather it ſeemeth to goe well with the deſpiſers of God: but the life of the godlie is full of myſeries. Therefore our heartes ſhould oftentimes faint and quaile, vnleſſe we ſhould reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that the day of reſt ſhall come, which ſhall quench all the heate of our trouble, and make an end of our miſeries. The other pricke whereof I ſpake, is this, when as the fearefull iudgement of God cauſeth vs to ſhake off delicacie and drowſineſſe. So Peter mixeth in this place threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenings with promiſes, partly to the end hee may allure the Iewes vnto Chriſt, and partly that he may pricke them forward with feare. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more this is a thing much vſed in the ſcripture, as it ſpeaketh either vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the reprobate, or vnto the elect, ſometimes to make the day of the Lord dolefull and fearefull, ſometime to make the ſame pleaſant and to be wiſhed for Peter therefore doth very well, who whileſt that hee put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the Iewes in good hope of pardon, doeth make the day of Chriſte pleaſant to them, to the end they may deſire the ſame.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And ſhall ſend him.</hi> He ſaith expreſly, that Chriſt ſhalbe iudge, to the ende they may know that the contempt of the Goſpel ſhal not be vnpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed. For how ſhould not Chriſt puniſh the ſame? In the meane while this doth greatly comfort the faithfull, when as they know that it ſhall be in his hand to giue ſaluation, who doth nowe promiſe and offer the ſame. He addeth moreouer that he ſhal come, who is now preached vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. Whereby he taketh away all excuſe of ignoraunce. As if hee ſhould ſay, Chriſt is preached vnto you nowe, before hee come to iudge the world: to the end that thoſe who will imbrace him, may receiue the frute of their faith at that day: and to the end that others who ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe him, may be puniſhed for their vnbeliefe. Although the Grecians do read this two waies. For ſom books haue <hi>procecerugmenon</hi> that is prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched before: &amp; other ſome, <hi>procecheiriſmenon</hi> that is ſhewed or ſet before their eyes. But both haue one ſenſe: to wit, that Chriſt is not offred vnto them in vaine now by the doctrine of the Goſpell: becauſe he ſhall bee ſent the ſecond time by his father, to be a iudge armed and prepared to render vengeaunce, vnleſſe they imbrace him nowe for their Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</p>
               <p n="21">21 <hi>Whom the heauen muſt conteine.</hi> Becauſe mens ſenſes are alwaies bent and inclined toward the groſſe and earthly beholding of God and Chriſte, the Iewes might think with themſelues, that Chriſte was prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in deed to be raiſed vp from the dead, yet could they not tell where he was, for no man did ſhew them where he was. Therfore Peter preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:7788:48"/> them, when he ſaith, that hee is in heauen. Whereuppon it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that they muſt lift vp their minds on high, to the end they may ſeek Chriſt with the eyes of faith, although hee bee farre from them, althogh he dwell without the world in the heauenly glory. But this is a doubtful ſpeech: becauſe we may as wel vnderſtand it, that Chriſte is contained or comprehended in the heauens, as that hee doth comprehende the heauens. Let vs not therefore vrge the word, being of a doubtfull ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication: but let vs content our ſelues with that which is certaine, that wee muſt ſeeke for Chriſt no where els ſaue only in heauen, whiles that we hope for the laſt reſtoring of all things: becauſe he ſhall be far from vs, vntil our mindes aſcend high aboue the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vntill the time of restoring.</hi> As touching the force and cauſe, Chriſte hath alreadie reſtored al things by his death: but the effect doth not yet fullie appeare: becauſe that reſtoring is yet in the courſe, and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently our redemption, for as much as we do yet grone vnder the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of ſeruitude. For as the kingdome of Chriſt is only begun, and the perfection thereof is deferred vntill the laſt day, ſo thoſe thinges which are annexed thereunto, doe nowe appeare only in part. Therefore if at this day wee ſee manie thinges confuſed in the worlde, let this hope ſet vs vppon foote and refreſhe vs, that Chriſt ſhall once come, that he may reſtore all thinges. In the meane ſeaſon, if wee ſee the reliques of ſinne hang on vs, if we be inuironned on euery ſide with diuers miſeries, if the world be full of waſting and ſcattering abroad, let vs bewaile theſe miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, yet ſo that we be vpholde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the hope of reſtoring. And this is the reaſon why Chriſte doth not appeare by and by, becauſe the warfare of the church is not yet full, whoſe time ſeeing it is appointed by God, it is not for vs to preuent the ſame.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Which hee ſpake.</hi> I do not expound this of the times alone: but I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it vnto the whole period: ſo that the ſenſe is this, that whatſoeuer he had ſpoken before of the kingdome of Chriſt, is witneſſed by all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes. Certes the Goſpell doth winne no ſmall credite heereby, that ſo ſoone as God began to ſhew himſelfe to the worlde, he did alwayes ſet Chriſt before them: after that he began to ſpeake vnto the Fathers, he did alwayes lay this foundation of doctrine. By the ſame argument Paul commendeth the Goſpell both in the beginning of his Epiſtle to the Romanes, and alſo in the end, to wit, that it is no newe thing, but promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from the beginning.<note place="margin">Rom. 1.1. &amp; 16.25.</note> This is true antiquitie, which is able to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe credite to doctrine: when as God himſelfe is the authour, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Prophetes the witneſſes: and the continuall courſe of times confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the teſtimonie. This confirmatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was eſpecially neceſſarie for the Iewes, who being brought vp in the doctrine of the law, ought to admit nothing but that which agreeth therewith. Therefore Peter doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde them only to call to minde thoſe thinges which the prophetes haue teſtified of Chriſte.</p>
               <q>
                  <p n="22">
                     <hi>22</hi> Moſes truly ſaid vnto the fathers: The Lord your God ſhall raiſe vp a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet vnto you of your brethren: him ſhall ye heare according to al things which
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:7788:48"/> hee ſhall ſpeake vnto you.</p>
                  <p n="23">

                  <p n="24">
                     <hi>24</hi> And al the prophets from Samuel, &amp; thencefoorth as many as haue ſpoken, haue likewiſe foretolde theſe dayes.</p>
               </q>
               <p n="22">22 By this argument he proueth, that hee goeth not about to cauſe them to reuolt from Moſes, becauſe it is a part of the law to take heed to and obey this chief teacher. Here might a dout ariſe, why Peter thought it more conuenient to cite this teſtimonie of Moſes than others, ſeeing there were many other in readineſſe far more plain: but he did this for this cauſe, becauſe hee intreateth in this place of the authoritie of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. And this was the beſt way to bring the Iewes to be Chriſt his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. For he ſhould haue preached in vaine of all other things, vnleſſe they had been perſwaded, that his doctrine was reuerently to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. This is therfore the thing which Peter aimeth at, to bring them to heare Chriſt willinglie, as the maſter who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God hath appointed to teach them. But here ariſeth a queſtion which hath in it great difficultie: too wit, in that Peter applieth that vnto the perſon of Chriſt, which Moſes ſpake generally of the prophets. For althogh he make mention of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet in the ſingular number, yet the text doth plainley declare, that he ſpeaketh not of one alone: but that this worde is put indefinitely. For af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that Moſes had forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the people to giue them ſelues vnto the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions of the Gentiles, by turning aſide vnto enchaunters &amp; ſooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayers, he ſheweth them therwithall a remedie, whereby they may auoid all vanitie: to wit, if they depend wholie vpon the word of God alone. By this meanes he promiſeth that God will be carefull at all times to ſende them prophets, that they may teach the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aright. As if he ſhould ſay, God will neuer ſuffer you to be deſtitute of prophets, of whom you may learn whatſoeuer ſhalbe profitable for you to know. And Moſes ſaith expreſly, of thy brethren, to the end the Iewes may know that the oracles of God are to bee ſought and fet no where els, ſeeing that God had appointed vnto them teachers of the kinred of Abraham. Hee addeth further, like <hi>vnto me:</hi> that they may know that they were not to heare God onely at one time, or by the mouth of one man: but as God proceedeth to teache vs by diuers miniſters, throughout the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuall courſe of times, ſo muſt we hold on in the obedience of the word. Nowe the Iewes were wont to reuerence Moſes: therefore he will haue them to giue like honour to the prophets. I know that many would faine reſtraine it vnto Chriſte. They catch at this word,<note place="margin">Deut. 18.15</note> whereas Moſes doth teſtifie that the prophet ſhalbe like vnto him: wheras notwithſtanding it is written that ther aroſe none like vnto Moſes. I confeſſe that there is in both places the ſame note of likenes, yet in a diuers ſenſe. For in the ſecond place the likenes or equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie is expreſſed, as it doth plainly appeare. They catch alſo at another thing, that the prophet ſhal far excel Moſes, of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he beareth witnes as a crier or harrold. But this is neuer a whit ſtronger: becauſe Moſes goeth about to bring to paſſe, that the word of God may be beleeued by whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer it be brought.</p>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:7788:49"/>
               <p>Therefore ther is no cauſe why we ſhould ſet our ſelues to be laughed to ſcorn by the Iews, by wreſting the words of Moſes viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly, as if he ſpake of Chriſt alone in this place. Yet muſt wee ſee, whether Peter doth cite the teſtimonie fitlie, whoſe authoritie ought to ſerue for a ſound reaſon. I ſay that in Peter his ſpeech there is nothing which is not moſt conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient. For he ſaw that which all men ought to graunt, that this teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie doth ſo appertain vnto the other Prophets, that yet notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding it doeth chiefly commend Chriſt, not only becauſe that he is the prince and chiefe of all the Prophets, but becauſe all other former propheſies were directed toward him, and becauſe God did at length ſpeake abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely by his mouth. For God ſpake in diuers maners, &amp; at ſundrie times in times paſt, vnto our fathers by the Prophetes, he added the concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at length, in the laſt dayes, in his only begotten ſonne. Therefore it came to paſſe, that they wanted prophets for a certaine yeeres before his comming:<note place="margin">Heb. 1.1.2. Malac. 4.4. Mat. 11.13. Iohn. 4.25.</note> which thing is plainly gathered out of the wordes of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachie: who after that he hath commaunded the people to be mindfull of the law, he paſſeth ouer by &amp; by vnto Iohn Baptiſt &amp; vnto Chriſt: as if he ſhould ſay, that the propheſies are now ended vntill the laſt reuelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on come: according to that, The law and the prophets propheſied vntill Iohn: after that the kingdom of God is preached. And that was ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon amongeſt the people, that the woman of Samaria could ſay accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the common fame and opinion, We know that the <hi>Meſſias</hi> ſhall come, who will teach vs all things. Therefore we know that after the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne of the people, all the prophets ceaſed, to the end they might bee made more attentiue to heare Chriſte, by that ſilence or intermiſſion of reuelations. Therefore Peter did not wreſt this place, or abuſe the ſame through ignorance, but he tooke that doctrine which all men had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued for a principle: that god had promiſed to teach his people at the firſt by his prophets as by means, but at le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth principally by Chriſt, at whoſe hands they were to hope for the perfect manifeſtation &amp; laying open of al things. And to this purpoſe ſerueth that excellent teſtimony, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation wherewith his father ſetteth him foorth, Heare him.</p>
               <p n="23">
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 17.5.</note>23 <hi>Euerie ſoule.</hi> Here, by a moſt greeuous puniſhment againſt the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious, the authority of al the prophets, but moſt of al of Chriſt is eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed. And that for good cauſes: For ſeeing there is nothing that God doth account more precious than his worde, it cannot be that he ſhould ſuffer the ſame to be freely conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned. Therfore if any man deſpiſed the lawe of Moſes, he was adiudged to die the death. And hereunto Moſes had reſpect when he ſaid, He ſhalbe put away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> among the people. For God had adopted the ſtock and kinred of Abraham vnto himſelf, vpon this condition, that this might bee ſufficient for them vnto the chiefeſt felicitie to be reckoned in that number, as it is ſaid in the Pſalme, Bleſſed is the people whoſe god is the Lord. And in another place, Bleſſed is the nation whom the Lorde hath choſen to be his inheritaunce. Wherefore it is not to be doubted, but that he pronounceth that he ſhall be blotted out of the booke of life, whoſoeuer ſhall refuſe to heare Chriſt. For he is not worthie to be accounted one of the church, whoſoeuer he be that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeth
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:7788:49"/> to haue him to be his maſter, by who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alone God doth teach vs, &amp; by whom he will haue vs to heare himſelf: and he cutteth himſelfe away from the bodie, whoſoeuer he be, that refuſeth to be vnder the head.</p>
               <p n="24">24 <hi>And all.</hi> When as he ſaith that all the prophetes doe with one conſent ſend their ſcholers vnto Chriſte: that appeareth more plainely hereby which I ſaid, that the commendation of the Goſpel is contained vnder that teſtimony of Moſes, and ſo conſequently that the concluſion of prophecies is principally noted. Againe this maketh much for the certaintie of the Goſpel, that al the prophets for a long time do yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſo temper their forme of teaching with one conſent, that they doe teſtifie all together, that men ought to hope for a certaine bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and more perfect thing. Therfore whoſoeuer will beleeue Moſes and the prophets, he muſt needs ſubmit himſelf vnto the doctrine of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Ioh. 5.47.</note> without which, all that is lame and vnperfect which they taught.</p>

And ſo as he pricked them forward to obey the Goſpell by terrifiyng them with the terror of puniſhment, ſo be allureth them now againe to receiue the grace which is offered them in Chriſt. So that we ſee how that God omitteth nothing whereby he may bring vs vnto him ſelfe. And it is the dutie of a wiſe miniſter, ſo to pricke forwarde the ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſh and ſlow bellies, that he doe lead thoſe gently, which are apt to bee taught: wee muſt alſo note diligently this courſe of teaching, where Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſheweth that the Goſpell is aſſigned and appointed vnto the Iewes. For it is not ſufficient to haue the mercie of God preached vnto vs ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, vnleſſe we alſo know that the ſame is offered vnto vs by the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ordinaunce of God. For this cauſe is it that Paule ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth ſo much vppon the auouching of the calling of the Gentiles, becauſe if any man ſhould thinke, that the Goſpell came vnto him by chaunce,<note place="margin">Rom. 15.8. Eph. 3.3. &amp; 4.</note> when as it was ſcattered here and there, faith ſhoulde quaile: yea there ſhould bee only a doubtful opinion in ſteed of faith. Therefore to the ende wee may ſtedfaſtly beleeue the promiſe of ſaluation, this application (that I may ſo terme it) is neceſſarie: that God doeth not caſte foorthe vncertaine voyces, that they may hang in the ayre, but that he doth direct the ſame vnto vs by his certaine &amp; determinate counſel. Peter telleth the Iewes, that Chriſte is promiſed vnto them after this ſort, to the end they may more willinglie embrace him. And how proueth he this? becauſe they are the children of the prophets and of the couenant. Hee calleth them the children of the Prophets, which were of the ſame nation, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were heyres of the couenant,<note place="margin">Gen. 17.7.</note> which did belong vnto all the whole
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:7788:50"/> bodie of the people. For he argueth thus: God made his couenaunt with our fathers: Therefore wee which are their poſteritie, are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in the couenaunt. Whereby the doubting ſubtiltie of the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts is refuted, who do expound the children of Abraham only alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorically: as if God had had no reſpect to his ſtock, when he ſaide, I will be the god of thy ſeed. Certainly Peter doth not ſpeake in this place of the ſhadowes of the law: but he affirmeth that this is of force vnder the kingdome of Chriſt, that God doth adopt the children together with the fathers:<note place="margin">Rom. 9.7.</note> and ſo conſequently the grace of ſaluation may be extended vnto thoſe which are as yet vnborne. I graunt in deed that many which are the children of the faithful, according to the fleſh, are counted ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtardes, and not legitimate, becauſe they thruſt themſelues out of the holy progenie through their vnbeleef. But this doth no whit hinder the Lord from calling &amp; admitting the ſeede of the godly into fellowſhip of grace. And ſo although the common election be not effectual in all, yet may it ſet open a gate for the ſpecial elect.<note place="margin">Rom. 11.23.</note> As Paul intreateth in the 11. to the Romanes, whence we muſt fet an anſwere for this queſtion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And in thy ſeed.</hi> He proueth that the couenant was made with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, becauſe God ſaid vnto Abraham, In thy ſeed ſhal all nations bee bleſſed.<note place="margin">Gen. 22.18.</note> But if we admit Paul his interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, this teſtimonie ſhal make nothing for the preſent cauſe. Paul teacheth that Chriſt is this ſeede. If the bleſſing be promiſed to all mankind by Chriſt,<note place="margin">Gal. 3.16.</note> what is this to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecial or particular priuiledge of one nation? Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly Peter himſelf ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth ſhortly after to ſubſcribe to this expoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Paul, when as he ſaith that Chriſt was ſent, that in him the Iewes may be bleſſed. For this could not be, vnles Chriſt were that bleſſed ſeed. I anſwere, When Paule refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth it vnto Chriſt, he ſtandeth not vpon the word <hi>ſeed,</hi> but hee hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to an higher thing: to wit, that it cannot be one ſeed, vnles it be vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted &amp; knit together in Chriſt, as in the head. For Iſmael &amp; Iſaac althogh both of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be the ſonnes of Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet do they not make one ſeed: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they be diuided into two people. Therfore though many be eſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the family of Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which came of him according to the fleſh, yet Moſes noteth one certain body, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he promiſeth the bleſſing vnto the ſeed of Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And whence co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth the vnity, ſaue only from the head which is in Chriſt? In this ſenſe doth Paul vnderſtande this worde <hi>ſeed,</hi> of Chriſt, althogh it be a nowne collectiue, becauſe if you depart fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, the poſteritie of Abraham ſhall be as torne members, neither ſhall there be any thing els in them, ſaue only meere waſtnes &amp; ſcattering a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad. Peter agreeth with that doctrine, becauſe he doth ſo extende the bleſſing vnto all the people, that he doth neuertheles ſeek the fountain in Chriſt. Secondly foraſmuch as the Iewes doe what they can to wring from vs this teſtimonie, the godly Readers muſt arme the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues againſt their cauils: &amp; ſo much the rather bicauſe chriſtian writers haue beene too ſlack in this point: as I haue ſaid in the epiſt. to the Galathians. Firſt as touching the word <hi>ſeed,</hi> there is no cauſe why they ſhould prattle that Paul doth not rightly reſtraine it vnto Chriſt. For hee doeth not this ſimply, but in that reſpect whereof I haue ſpoken. In which point I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe both our latine &amp; Greek interpreters haue erred. Now we muſt ſee
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:7788:50"/> what this maner of ſpeech doth import. The Gentiles ſhall be bleſſed in the ſeed of Abraham. Our men think that there is ſome cauſe noted, to wit, that through that ſeed the Gentiles ſhalbe bleſſed. The Iewes toſſe this to &amp; fro, becauſe this phraſe ſignifieth euery where in the ſcriptures an exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple or ſimilitude: as on the otherſide to be curſed in Sodom, in Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, or in an other people, is to take them for a notable example of a curſe. I anſwere that it is a doubtful ſpeech, &amp; taken diuerſly according to the circumſtance of the places which the Iewes do craftily diſſemble. For they gather many places, out of which they proue that there is a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon made: as if it ſhould be ſaid, The gentiles ſhall deſire to be bleſſed like to the ſeed of Abraham. But when as the ſcripture ſaith elswhere, They ſhall bleſſe themſelues in the liuing God: as Iere. 4. Eſay 65.<note place="margin">Iere. 4.2. Eſay. 65.16. Deut. 10.8.</note> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, do bleſſe in the name of the Lorde, Deut 10. and in other ſuch like places: who doth not ſee that there is a cauſe expreſſed? Therefore I ſay that this forme of ſpeech ought to bee vnderſtood according to the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of the places. And nowe foraſmuch as I haue declared that the ſeed of Abraham can be found no where els ſaue only in Chriſt, it remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth that we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider of what ſort the office of Chriſt is. So ſhall it appear vndoutedly, that he is not made a bare example or paterne, but that the bleſſing is trulie promiſed in him: becauſe without him we be all accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Yet ther remaineth one dout. For certes both theſe are ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in one ſenſe: They ſhall be bleſſed in thee, &amp;, In thy ſeed. But Abraham was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els but a type or myrror of the bleſſing. I anſwere that in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Abraham that body is alſo noted out, which dependeth vpon one head &amp; is knit together in the ſame.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>All the families.</hi> The Iewes do groſly expound this, that all nations ſhal deſire to be bleſſed, as the ſeed of Abraham. But wee ſay otherwiſe, That they ſhalbe ingraffed into the ſocietie. For the name of Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tended to this end, becauſe it ſhould come to paſſe that god ſhuld gather al peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple vnto him. Alſo when the prophets will declare the force hereof, they foretell euery where that the inheritance of ſaluation ſhall be common to the Gentiles. And heereby it appeareth, that the couenaunt of God, which was then proper to the Iewes alone, is not only co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon to all men but is made with vs expreſly. Otherwiſe we could not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiue that hope of ſaluation which is firme enogh out of the Goſpel. Therfore let vs not ſuffer this promiſe to be wrong from vs, which is as it were a ſolemne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, whereby the Lord maketh vs his heires together with the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Whereunto Peter alſo had reſpect, when as he ſaith ſhortly after, That Chriſt was firſt ſent vnto the Iewes. For hee doth ſignifie that the Gentiles alſo haue their order, though it be ſecundarie.</p>
               <p n="26">26 <hi>He hath raiſed vp his ſonne.</hi> He gathereth out of the words of Moſes that Chriſt is now reuealed. But the wordes do ſeeme to import no ſuch thing: yet doth he reaſon fitly thus, becauſe the bleſſing could no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be, vnles the beginning therof did flowe from the Meſſias. For wee muſt alwaies remember this, that all mankind is accurſed, and therefore there is a ſingular remedie promiſed vs, which is performed by Chriſte alone. Wherfore he is the onely fountaine &amp; beginning of the bleſſing. And if ſobeit Chriſt came to this end that he may bleſſe the Iewes firſt,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:7788:51" rendition="simple:additions"/> and ſecondly vs, he hath vndoubtedly done that which was his dutie to doe, and we ſhall feele the force and effect of this dutie in our ſelues, vnleſſe our vnbeleefe doe hinder vs. This was a part of the Prieſt his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice vnder the lawe, to bleſſe the people and leaſt this ſhould bee onlie a vaine ceremonie,<note place="margin">Num. 6.27. Heb. 7.1.6.</note> there was a promiſe added: as it is Numb. 6. And that which was ſhadowed in the olde prieſthoode, was truely perfourmed in Chriſt. Concerning which matter we haue ſpoken more at large in the ſeuenth chapter to the Hebrewes. I like not Eraſmus his tranſlation. For he ſaith, When he had raiſed him vp, as if he ſpake of a thing which was done long agoe. But Peter meaneth rather, that Chriſt was raiſed vppe, when he was declared to be the author of the bleſſing: which thing ſince it was done of late and ſodainly, it ought to moue their minds the more. For the ſcripture vſeth to ſpeake thus, as in the laſt place of Moſes, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto Peter alludeth. To raiſe vp a prophet, is to furniſh him with neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary giftes to fulfil his function, and as it were to preferre him to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of prophetical honour. And Chriſt was raiſed vp then, when he ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled the functio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> enioyned him by his father, but the ſame thing is done daily when he is offered by the Goſpell that he may excell amongeſt vs. We haue ſaid that in the Aduerbe of order, <hi>first,</hi> is noted the right of the firſt begotten, becauſe it was expedient that Chriſt ſhould beginne with the Iewes, that he might afterward paſſe ouer vnto the Gentiles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whiles that he turneth.</hi> Hee doth againe commend the doctrine of repentance, to the end we may learne to include vnder the bleſſing of of Chriſt newnes of life, as when Eſaias promiſeth that a redeemer ſhould come to Sion, he addeth a reſtraint, Thoſe which in Iacob ſhall be turned from their iniquities. For Chriſt doth not do away the ſins of the faithful, to the end they may graunt liberty to themſelues to ſin vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this colour: but he maketh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> therewith all newe men. Although we muſt diligently diſtinguiſh theſe two benifittes which are linked to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that this ground worke may continue, that we are reconciled to God by free pardon. I knowe that other men turne it otherwiſe: but this is the true meaning of Luke. For he ſpeaketh thus word for worde: in turning euery one from his wickednes.</p>

               </q>
               <p n="1">1 In this narration we muſt conſider three things chiefly. That ſo ſoone as the truth of the Goſpel doth once appeare, Satan ſetteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:7788:51" rendition="simple:additions"/> againſt the ſame on the other ſide ſo much as he is able, &amp; atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pteth all thinges that he may ſmoulder the ſame in the verie firſt beginnings. Secondly that God doth furniſh his children with vnuincible force and ſtrength, that they may ſtande ſtedfaſt and vnmoueable againſt all aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaultes of Satan: and not yeeld vnto the violence of the wicked. And laſt of all we muſt note the euent and end, that howſoeuer the aduerſaries ſeem to beare the chiefeſt ſwindge, &amp; they themſelues do omit nothing which may ſerue to blot out the name of Chriſte: and on the other ſide howſoeuer the miniſters of ſound doctrine be as ſheep in the mouths of wolues: yet doth god ſpread abroad the kingdome of his ſonne, he foſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the light of the goſpel which is lighted, &amp; he is the protector of his children. Therefore ſo often as the doctrine of the Goſpell ariſeth, and diuers motions do riſe on the other ſide, and the courſe thereof is letted diuers waies, there is no cauſe why godly mindes ſhould faint or quaile as at ſome vnwonted thing: but they ought rather to reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber that theſe are the ordinary endeuors of Satan, ſo that we muſt think vpon this wel, before it come to paſſe, that it cannot otherwiſe bee, but that Satan will ſpue out all his might &amp; main, ſo often as Chriſt doth come abroad with his doctrine. And therewithall let vs conſider that the conſtancie of the apoſtles is ſet forth vnto vs for an example, leaſt being ouercome either with any perils, or threatnings, or terrors, we leape back from that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of faith which the Lord requireth at our hands. And moreouer, let vs co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort our ſelues with this, that wee need not to doubt but that the Lord wil giue proſperous ſucceſſe whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we haue done our duty faithfully.</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>And as they ſpake.</hi> Hereby it appeareth how watchful the wicked be: becauſe they are alwaies ready at an inch to ſtop the mouth of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants of Chriſt. And vndoutedly they came together as it were to que<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch ſome great fire. Which thing Luke ſignifieth, when as hee ſaith that the ruler or captain of the temple came alſo, and hee addeth moreouer that they tooke it greeuouſly that the apoſtles did teach. Therfore they came not vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by chaunce, but of ſet purpoſe: that according to their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie they might reſtrain the apoſtles &amp; put them to ſilence. And yet they haue ſome ſhew of law &amp; equitie. For if any man did raſhly intrude himſelf, it was the office of the high prieſt to repreſſe him: &amp; alſo in like ſort to keep the people in the obedience of the law &amp; the prophets, &amp; to preuent all new doctrines. Therfore when they heare vnknowen men, &amp; ſuch as had no publik authority, preaching vnto the people in the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, they ſeeme according as their office did require, &amp; they were comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by God to adreſſe themſelues to remedie this. And ſurely at the firſt bluſh it ſeemeth that there was nothing in this action worthie of repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion: but the end doth at length declare that their counſell was wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, &amp; their affection vngodly. Againe it was an hard matter for the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles to eſcape infamie and reproch, becauſe they being priuate &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed perſons, did take vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> publike authority. To wit, becauſe when things are out of order, many things muſt be aſſaied contrary to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon cuſtome: &amp; eſpecially when we are to auouch &amp; defend religion &amp; the worſhip of God. &amp; the ringleaders the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues do ſtop alwayes, &amp; doe
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:7788:52"/> abuſe that office againſt God, which was committed vnto them by god. The faithfull cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pions of Chriſte muſt ſwallow vp &amp; paſſe through this ignominy in poperie. For a thouſand ſommers will go ouer their heads, before any reformation or amendment will wex ripe amongſt them for the better. Therfor Luke ſtandeth vpon this point, when as he ſaith that they were greeued, becauſe the reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was preached in the name of Chriſt. For hereupon it foloweth that they did hate the doctrine before they knew the ſame. He expreſſeth the Saduces by name, as thoſe which were more couragious in this cauſe. For they were almoſt a part of the Prieſts: but becauſe the queſtion is about the reſurrection, they ſet them ſelues againſt the apoſtles more tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the reſt. Furthermore this was moſt monſtrous confuſion amongeſt the Iewes, in that this ſect which was ſo profane, was of ſuch authority. For what godlines could remaine, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as the immortalitie of the ſoul was cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted as a fable &amp; that freely? But me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> muſt needs run headlo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g after this ſort, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they haue once ſuffred pure doctrin to fal to the ground amongſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Wherfore we muſt ſo much the more diligently beware of euerie wicked turning a ſide, leaſt ſuche a ſtep downe follow immediately. Some men thinke that the ruler of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was choſen from among the prieſtes: but I doe rather thinke that he was ſome chiefe captaine of the Roman armie. For it was a place which was fortified both naturally and artificially. Again, Herod had builded a tower there, which was called <hi>Antonia.</hi> So that it is to be thought that he had placed there a band of ſouldiers, and that the Romaine Captaine had the gouernment of the Temple: leaſt it ſhould be a place of refuge for the Iewes, if they had ſtirred vppe any tumult, which wee may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe gather out of Ioſephus. And this agreeth very wel that the enemies of Chriſt did craue the help of the ſecular power, vnder colour of appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſome tumult. In the meane ſeaſon they ſeeke fauour at the handes of the Romanes, as if they were carefull to maintaine the right of their empire.</p>
               <p n="4">4 <hi>And many of them which heard.</hi> The Apoſtles are put in priſon, but the force of their preaching is ſpread farre and wide, and the courſe therof is at libertie. Of which thing Paule boaſteth very much, that the worde of God is not bound with him. And here we ſee that Satan &amp; the wicked haue libertie graunted them to rage againſt the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God: yet ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they not (maugre their heads) preuaile, but that god doth further and promote the kingdome of his ſonne, Chriſt doth gather togeather his ſheepe, and that a few men vnarmed, furniſhed with no garriſons, do ſhew foorth more power in their voice alone, than al the whole world by raging againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. This is in deed no common work of God, that one ſer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mon brought foorth ſuch plentifull frute: but this is the more to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered at, that the faithfull are not terrified with the preſent daunger, and diſcouraged from taking vp the croſſe of Chriſte together with the faith. For this was a hard beginning for nouices. Chriſt did more euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie declare by this efficacie and force of doctrine, that he was aliue, than if he ſhould haue offered his bodie to be handeled with hand, and to be ſeen with the eyes. And wheras it is ſaid that the number of thoſe which
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:7788:52"/> beleeued, did growe to be about fiue thouſand, I do not vnderſtand it of thoſe which were newly added, but of the whole church.</p>

               <p n="5">5 It is a thing worthie to be noted in this place, that the wicked do omit no ſubtiltie that they may blot out the Goſpell and the name of Chriſt, &amp; yet do they not obtain that which they hoped for: becauſe god doth make their counſels fruſtrate. For they make an aſſemblie where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they doe all thinges ſo tyrannouſly, that yet notwithſtanding luſte beareth a ſhew of right, and libertie is driuen farre away, and at length, the truth may ſeem to be condemned by good right.

And therefore there is no place left for the truth. Yet wee ſee how the Lord bringeth their counſell to nought, whiles that beeing kept backe with feare of the people, they ſtay themſelues and bridle their furie, to the ende they may auoid enuie.

All men graunt that the Lord was crucified in the eighteenth yeere of Tiberius And that empire did continue foure yeres longer. And it muſt needs be, that there were 3. yeres complete after the death of Chriſt, before Pilate was put from the office of the proconſull. For when Tiberius was dead, he came to Rome: So that Caiphas was hie prieſt yet 3. yeeres after the death of Chriſt.

For if vnder colour of a miracle, the Apoſtles woulde haue drawen away the people from the true &amp; ſincere worſhippe of God, they ſhould haue been worthily called to anſwere for themſelues: becauſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion doth far excell all the good thinges of this preſent life. But ſeeing they (hauing no cauſe at al) did wickedly make an offence of that which they ought to haue honored: Peter being ſupported with this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fidence doth at the firſt gird them wittily with a taunting preface, becauſe they ſit as iudges to condemne good deedes. Yet he toucheth this point but lightly, that he may paſſe ouer vnto the matter.</p>
               <p n="10">10 <hi>Be it knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto you.</hi> Peter might (as I haue alredy ſaid) haue turned aſide vnto many ſtarting holes, if hee would not haue entred the cauſe: but becauſe the myracle was wrought, to this ende, that the name of Chriſt might be glorified, he deſcendeth by and by vnto this. For hee knewe that he was the miniſter of ſuch excellent power of GOD that
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:7788:53"/> he might haue a ſeale to confirme his doctrine. In the meane while the wicked, will they nill they, are enforced to heare that which they would haue had buried full deepe. When they haue done what they can, this is all, they cauſe Peter to auouch and obiect to their faces, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they were ſo grieued, when it was ſpoken to others. And firſt he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth Chriſt the authour of the myracle. Secondly becauſe it ſeemed to be an abſurde and vncredible thing, that a deade man ſhould bee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dewed with diuine power, he teſtifieth that Chriſt is aliue, becauſe God hath raiſed him vp from the deade, howſoeuer they had crucified him. So that the myracle giueth him occaſion to preach the reſurrection of Chriſt. And by this teſtimonie Peter meant to prooue, that he was the true Meſſias. He ſaith that they had crucified him, not onely to the end he may vpbraide this vnto them, that they may acknowledge their fault: but alſo that they may vnderſtand, that they haue in vaine ſtriuen againſt God: and ſo conſequently ceaſe to rage ſo vnluckely and with ſuch deadly ſucceſſe.</p>
               <p n="11">11 <hi>This is the ſtone.</hi> He confirmeth by teſtimonie of Scripture that it is no new thing, that the ringleaders of the Church, which haue glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous titles giuen them, and haue the chiefe roome in the Temple of God, haue notwithſtanding wickedlie reiected Chriſt. Therefore hee citeth a place out of the hundreth and eighteenth Pſalme:<note place="margin">Pſa. 118.22.</note> where Dauid complaineth that he is reiected of the Captaine of the people, and yet notwithſtanding hee boaſteth that hee was choſen of God, to haue the chiefe roome. Moreouer hee compareth the Church or the ſtate of the kingdome by an vſuall metaphor to a building. Hee calleth thoſe which haue the gouernment, the maſters of the woorke, and hee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth himſelfe the principall ſtone, whereon the whole building is ſtaied and grounded. Fot that is meant by the head of the corner. Therefore this is Dauids comfort, that howſoeuer the Captaines haue reiected him, ſo that they woulde not graunt him euen the baſeſt place, yet did not their wicked and vngodlie endeuours hinder him from being extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by God, vnto the higheſt degree of honour. But that was ſhadowed in Dauid, which God woulde haue perfectly expreſſed in the Meſſias. Therefore Peter dealeth very aptly, when as he citeth this teſtimonie, as being ſpoken before of Chriſt as they knew full well that it did agree properly to him. Now we know to what end Peter did cite the Pſalme: to wit, leaſt the Elders and Prieſtes being vnaduiſedly puffed vp with their honor, ſhould take to themſelues authoritie and libertie to allowe or diſalow whatſoeuer they would. For it is euident that the ſtone refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the chiefe builders, is placed by Gods owne hande in the chiefe place, that it may ſupport the whole houſe. Furthermore this hapneth not once onely, but it muſt bee fulfilled daily: at leaſt it muſt ſeeme no new thing, if the chiefe builders do euen now alſo reiect Chriſt. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the vaine boaſting of the Pope is plainely refuted, who maketh his boaſt of the bare title, that he may vſurpe whatſoeuer is Chriſts. Admit we graunt to the Pope and his horned beaſts that which they deſire, to wit, that they are appointed to bee ordinarie paſtours of the Church,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:7788:54"/> they can go no farther at length, than to be called chiefe builders with Annas and Caiphas. And it is euident what account ought to bee made of this title, which they think is ſufficient to mixe heauen &amp; earth togither. Now let vs gather out of this place ſom things which are worth the noting. For as much as they are called maſter builders who haue go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of the Church, the name itſelf putteth them in mind of their dutie. Therefore let them giue themſelues wholly to the building of the temple of God. And becauſe al men do not their dutie faithfully as they ought, let them ſee what is the beſt maner of building aright, to wit, let them retaine Chriſt for the foundation: that done, let them not mixe ſtraw and ſtubble in this building, but let them make the whole building of pure doctrine:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 3.12.</note> as Paul teacheth in 1. Cor. 3. Whereas God is ſaide to haue extolled Chriſt, who was reiected of the builders, this ought to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort vs, when as we ſee euen the Paſtors of the church, or at leaſt thoſe which are in great honor, wickedly rebell againſt Chriſt, that they may baniſh him. For we may ſafely ſet light by thoſe viſures, which they obiect againſt vs: ſo that we need not feare to giue Chriſt that honor, which god doth giue to him. But if hee winke for a time, yet doeth he laugh at the boldnes of his enimies from on high, whiles they rage &amp; fret vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> earth. Furthermore though their conſpiracies be ſtronge and garded with all aides, yet muſt we alwayes aſſure our ſelues of this, that Chriſt his honor ſhall remaine ſafe and ſound. And let the fruit of this confidence enſue alſo, that we be valiant and without feare in maintaining the kingdome of Chriſt, whereof God will be an inuincible defender, as he himſelfe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth. We haue alreadie ſpoken of Peter his conſtancie, in that, one ſimple man, hauing ſuch enuious iudges, and yet hauing but one partner in the preſent danger, ſheweth no token at all of feare, but doth freelie confeſſe in that raging and furious companie, that thing which he knew woulde be receiued with moſt contrary minds. And whereas he ſharplie vpbraideth vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that wickednes which they had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted, we muſt fet from hence a rule of ſpeech, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we haue to deale with the ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the truth. For we muſt beware of two faults on this behalf, that we ſeeme not to flatter by keeping ſilence or winking: for that were tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous ſilence, whereby the truth ſhould be betrayed. Againe, that we be not puffed vp with wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tonnes, or immoderate heat, as mens minds do oftentimes break out more then they ought, in contention. Therfore let vs vſe grauitie in this point, yet ſuch as is moderate: let vs chide freely, yet without al heate of railing. We ſee that Peter did obſerue this order. For at the firſt he giueth an honorable title: when hee is once come to the matter hee inueigheth ſharply againſt them: neither could ſuch vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlines as theirs was, bee concealed. Thoſe which ſhal follow this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, ſhall not onely haue Peter to be their guide, but alſo the ſpirit of God.</p>
               <p n="12">

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:7788:54"/> conſider this in all the benefites of God, to wit, that he is the fountaine of ſaluation. And he meant to pricke and ſting the Prieſts with this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as he ſaith that there is ſaluation in none other ſaue only in Chriſt, whom they went about to put quit out of remembrance. As if he ſhould ſay, that they are twiſe damned, who did not onely refuſe the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation offered them by God, but endeuour to bring the ſame to naught, and did take from all the people the fruit and vſe thereof. And although he ſeemeth to ſpeake vnto deafe men, yet doth he preach of the grace of Chriſt, if peraduenture ſome can abide to heare: if not, that they may at leaſt be depriued of all excuſe by this teſtimonie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Neither is there any other name.</hi> He expoundeth the ſentence next go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before. Saluation (ſaith he) is in Chriſt alone: becauſe God hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed that it ſhould be ſo. For by Name he meaneth the cauſe or mean. as if he ſhuld haue ſaid, For as much as ſaluation is in Gods power only, he wil not haue the ſame to be common to vs by any other means, then if we aske it of Chriſt alone. Wheras he ſaith <hi>vnder heauen,</hi> they do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly referre it vnto creatures: as if he ſhoulde ſay, that the force and power to ſaue, is giuen to Chriſt alone. Notwithſtanding I do rather thinke that this was added, becauſe men cannot aſcende into heauen, that they may come vnto God. Therefore ſeing we are ſo farre from the kingdome of God, it is needfull that God doe not onely inuite vs vnto himſelfe, but that reaching out his hand, he offer ſaluation vnto vs, that we may enioy the ſame. Peter teacheth in this place, that he hath done that in Chriſt, becauſe he came downe into the earth for this cauſe,<note place="margin">Ephe. 4.10.</note> that he might bring ſaluation with him. Neither is that contrary to this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine that Chriſt is aſcended aboue all heauens. For hee tooke vppon him our fleſh once for this cauſe, that hee might be a continuall pledge of our adoption. He hath reconciled the father to vs for euer by the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of his death: by his reſurrection he hath purchaſed for vs eternal life. And he is preſent with vs now alſo, that he may make vs partakers of the fruite of eternall redemption: but the reuealing of ſaluation is handled in this place, and wee knowe that the ſame was ſo reuealed in Chriſt, that we neede not any longer to ſay, Who ſhall aſcend into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen? Rom. 10. And if ſo bee this doctrine were deepely imprinted in the mindes of all men,<note place="margin">Rom. 10.6.</note> then ſhoulde ſo many controuerſies concerning the cauſes of ſaluation, be ſoone at an ende, wherewith the Church is ſo much troubled. The Papiſtes confeſſe with vs, that ſaluation is in God alone, but by and by they forge to themſelues infinite wayes to attaine vnto the ſame. But Peter calleth vs backe vnto Chriſt alone. They dare not altogither denie that wee haue ſaluation giuen vs by Chriſt: but whiles they feigne ſo manie helpes, they leaue him ſcarce the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth parte of ſaluation. But they were to ſeeke for ſaluation at the handes of Chriſt, wholly: for when Peter excludeth plainely all other meanes, hee placeth perfect ſaluation in Chriſt alone, and not ſome parte thereof onelie. So that they are farre from vnderſtanding this doctrine.</p>

Furthermore it is worth the noting, that they ſet the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of God againſt their decrees.

This queſtion doth the Pope aunſwere pleaſauntly, becauſe he ſaith that all thoſe thinges are diuine oracles whatſoeuer it hath pleaſed him to blunder out vnaduiſedly. By this meanes the daunger of contrarietie is taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. But the Biſhops can chalenge no more at this day, than God had giuen then to the order of the Prieſtes. Therefore this is a toy too chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh, That they can commaund nothing but that which is agreeable to the commaundement of God. Yea rather the thing it ſelfe declareth euidently, that there ſhall be no conflictt then, if they ſuffer their vaine and vnbridled luſt to raunge freely, hauing vanquiſhed and renounced the doctrine of Chriſt. Therefore by what title ſoeuer men be called, yet muſt we heare them onely vpon this condition, if they leade vs not away from obeying God.

For the Goſpel of Chriſt is now in hand, wherein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth both the glory of God, and the ſaluation of men. It is an vnmeete thing and ſacrilegious wickedneſſe, that the ſame ſhould be ſuppreſſed by prohibitions and menacings of men: for God commandeth that his Goſpel be preached: eſpecially ſythence they did know that they were choſen to be witneſſes &amp; preachers of Chriſt: and that God had opened their mouth.

How is it that being content with threatnings, they do not alſo rage againſt their bodies, ſaue onely becauſe the power of God doeth binde them as a chaine? Not that the feare of God doth preuaile with them for it is the regarde of the people alone which hindreth them: but the

Furthermore the woonderfull Counſell of God doth ſhew it ſelfe heere, in that the glory of Chriſt is furthered by thoſe which are his moſt deadly enimies. For whereas the Prieſtes doe aſſemble themſelues togither, it is not done without great rumour. All men waite for ſome rare and ſingular euent: the Apoſtles depart being let looſe and acquitted. Therefore the aduerſaries are not onely van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed: but they confirme the Goſpel againſt their will. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it is expedient for vs to marke again, that the faithful do ſo get the victorie, that they are alwaies humbled vnder the croſſe. For they are threatned againe and ſtraitly charged that they teach not hencefoorth in the name of Chriſt. Therefore they doe not ſo get the vpper hande, that they doe not triumph, ſaue onely vnder the reproch of the croſſe. Whereas Luke ſaith that they did <hi>all glorifie God,</hi> he noteth the fruite of the miracle now the ſecond time: although it may be that they were not all brought vnto the perfect ende. For that man which is touched with the feeling of the power of God, &amp; doth not come vnto Chriſt, neither hath his faith confirmed by the myracle, he ſtaieth as it were in the mid<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>way. Yet this was ſome thing, though not al, that the power of God was acknowledged in the healing of the man, ſo that the aduerſaries being aſhamed, did ceaſe off from their furie, or at leaſt giue backe a little.</p>

               <p>Wee are taught by this example, what is our duetie to doe, when our aduerſaries doe imperiouſly threaten vs. For wee muſt not careleſlie laugh in time of daunger, but the feare of daunger ought to driue vs to craue helpe at the hands of God: and this is a remedie to comfort and ſet vs vp on foote, leaſt being terrified with threatnings, wee ceaſe off from doing our duetie. Heere is a double fruit of this hiſtorie: that the diſciples of Chriſt doe not ieaſt when they heare that their enimies doe threaten them ſo ſore, and preaſe ſo ſore vppon them, as careleſſe and ſluggiſh men vſe to doe, but being touched with feare, they flie to ſeeke helpe at the handes of God: And againe they are not terrified, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet do they conceiue any immoderate feare: but craue of God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible conſtancie with right godly petitions.</p>
               <p n="24">24 <hi>Thou art God which hast created.</hi> Although this title and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Gods power be generall, yet it ought to be referred vnto the preſent matter. For they do in ſuch ſort acknowledge the power of God in the creation of the whole world, that they applie the ſame therewith all vnto the preſent vſe. In like ſort the Prophetes do oftentimes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the ſame, to the end they may redreſſe that feare which troubleth vs when we behold the power of our enimies. Secondly they adde there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the promiſe: &amp; they make theſe two the foundations of their bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, wherewith they are emboldned to pray. And ſurely our prayers are ſuch as they ought to be, and acceptable to God, onely then, when as ſtaying our ſelues vpon his promiſes and power, wee pray with certaine hope to obtaine that for which we pray. For we cannot otherwiſe haue any true confidence, vnleſſe God do will vs to come vnto him, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe that he is readie to helpe vs: and ſecondly vnleſſe we acknowledge that he is able ynough to helpe vs. Wherefore let the faithfull exerciſe themſelues in this double meditation, ſo often as they addreſſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vnto prayer. Furthermore we gather hereby after what ſort we ought to conſider the creation of the world: to wit, that we may knowe that all thinges are ſubiect to God, and ruled by his will: and when that the worlde hath done what it can, there ſhall no other thing come to paſſe but that which God hath decreed: yea that the wantonneſſe of the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:7788:57"/> wicked is monſtrous, as if the clay ſhould reſiſt the potter. For this is the meaning of the faithful generally, that whatſoeuer dangers hange ouer their heads, yet can God preuent the ſame infinit wayes, for as much as all things are in his hande: and that hee is able to make all the parts of heauen and earth (which he hath created) to obey him.</p>
               <p n="25">25 <hi>Who by the mouth of Dauid.</hi> They diſcende nowe vnto the ſeconde member, that they aske nothing but that which God hath promiſed to performe. So that his will and power are ioyned togither, to the ende they may fully aſſure themſelues that they ſhall obtaine their requeſtes. And becauſe the kingdome of Chriſt is now in hand, they make rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall of the promiſe of God, wherein he promiſeth to defende and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the ſame: ſo that when the whole worlde hath done what it can to ouerthrow it, yet all ſhall bee in vaine. And heerein appeareth their Godlineſſe, and ſyncere zeale, in that they are not ſo much carefull for their owne ſafetie, as for the encreaſing and aduancement of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Why haue the Gentiles raged?</hi> Wee muſt needes confeſſe that Dauid ſpeaketh of himſelfe: who after he was choſen King by the Lord, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed by Samuel the Prophet, did enioy the kingdome verie hardly, becauſe his enimies withſtoode him on euerie ſide. Wee knowe howe the rulers and people conſpired togither with Saul and his familie: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that, the Philiſtines and other ſtraunge enimies, deſpiſing him when hee came newlie to the crowne, made warre againſt him, ſtriuing who ſhould beginne firſt. Wherefore it is not without cauſe that he complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth that the Kings rage and take counſell togither, and that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple doe goe about diuerſe things. Neuertheleſſe becauſe he knew that God was the ſupporter of his kingdome, hee derideth their fooliſh en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes, and affirmeth that they are vaine. But becauſe his kingdome was eſtabliſhed, that it might bee a figure or image of the kingdome of Chriſt; Dauid doth not ſtay ſtill in the ſhadowe it ſelfe, but hee appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth the bodie: yea the holy Ghoſt, as the Apoſtles doe truely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pete the ſame, doeth ſharply reprooue the fooliſh and ridiculous mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the worlde, in that they dare inuade the kingdome of Chriſt which God had eſtabliſhed, as well in the perſon of Dauid as of Chriſt himſelfe. And this is a ſingular comfort, in that we heare that God is on our ſide, ſo long as wee goe on warfare vnder the kingdome of Chriſt. Heereby we may perſwade our ſelues, that howſoeuer al men both high and low, doe wickedly conſpire togither againſt this kingdome, yet ſhal they not preuaile. For what is all the whole world compared with God? But wee muſt firſt of all knowe and aſſure our ſelues of this, that God will continually maintaine the kingdome of his ſonne, whereof he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe is the author, ſo that we may ſet his decree (which ſhal not be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken) againſt the raſhneſſe of men: that truſting to the help of his hand, wee may not doubt to deſpiſe all the preparation and furniture of men though they be terrible. And he doth diligently expreſſe how great the bandes of the aduerſaries are: hee ſaith that they attempt all things, he doeth alſo recken vp their counſels, leaſt any of theſe doe terrifie vs.
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:7788:58"/> Furthermore when as the Pſalm teacheth, that the kingdome of Chriſt ſhall endure, maugre the heades of the aduerſaries, it doth alſo ſhewe that there ſhall be many aduerſaries, which ſhall endeuour to ouerthrow the ſame. On the one ſide hee bringeth in the Kinges raging, on the other, the people all out of quiet. Whereby he ſignifieth that all eſtates ſhall be offended at it. And no maruell, becauſe nothing is more contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to the fleſh, than the Spirituall ſworde of the Goſpell, wherewith Chriſt killeth vs,<note place="margin">Rom. 15.16.</note> that he may make vs obey him. Therefore wee muſt know this for a ſuertie, that the kingdome of Chriſt ſhall neuer be quiet in the world leaſt when we are to fight, we be afraid as at ſome ſtrange thing.</p>
               <p n="26">26 <hi>Againſt the Lorde and his Chriſt.</hi> The Spirit teacheth by this worde that al thoſe doe make warre againſt God, which refuſe to ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to Chriſt. They doe full little think this oftentimes. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it is ſo, that becauſe God will raigne in the parſon of his ſonne alone, we refuſe to obey him, ſo often as we rebell againſt Chriſt. As the Lord himſelfe ſaieth in Iohn, Hee which honoreth not the ſonne, hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not the father. Wherefore let the hypocrites profeſſe a thouſande times, that they meane nothing leſſe, than to make warre againſt God, yet ſhal they finde this true, that God is their open enemy, vnleſſe they embrace Chriſt with his goſpell. The vſe of this doctrine is double: For it armeth vs againſt all the terrours of the fleſh, becauſe wee muſt not feare, leſt they get the victorie of God, which withſtand the Goſpell. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine we muſt beware, leſt through the contempt of godlie doctrine, we aduaunce our ſelues againſt God to our owne deſtruction.</p>
               <p n="27">27 <hi>Haue met togither in this citie.</hi> They declare that this prophecie was prooued to bee true by the euent, to the ende they may belieue the ſame more aſſuredly. For the ſenſe is, Lorde thou haſt ſpoken it, and we haue in trueth tryed the ſame to be true. And they call to mynde that which was done fowre yeeres before or there about. In like ſort it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient for vs to applie the euents of things which are foretolde, to the confirmation of our faith. But becauſe it might ſeeme that the matter fell out farre otherwiſe then, than the Pſalme pronounceth, for aſmuch as they raged not in vaine, neither were the aſſaultes of the enemies fruſtrate, when they had put Chriſt to death: and theire violence went further afterward after a fearefull manner: the faithfull remooue this offence: and ſay that the enemies could doe no more, than God had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted. Therefore howſoeuer the wicked did ſuppoſe that Chriſt was quite taken awaye by death, and did now vainlie triumph, yet the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full confeſſe that their rage was all but vaine. But here may a queſtion be mooued, why he calleth them the Gentiles and people of Iſrael, ſeing there was but one bodie. I think that the diuerſitie of countries is noted in this place, out of which the Iewes came togither to the feaſt: as if they ſhould haue ſaid, that the Iewes which were borne in diuers places, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing made as it were a concourſe, did aſſault the kingdome of Chriſt, yet was their furie fruſtrate and of none effect.</p>

                  <hi>Thy holie ſonne Ieſus.</hi> The Grecians vſe the verie ſame worde which I

                  </gap> ſo called, becauſe he was the miniſter of God, as well in ruling the people, as in the office of a Prophet. But this worde Sonne agreeth better with the perſon of Chriſt, vnleſſe ſome man had leifer take it thus, that Luke meant to allude vnto that likelihood which Dauid had with Chriſt, when he ſetteth downe a worde of a double ſignification. It is expreſly ſaide that God hath annointed his ſonne, that that may truely agree to him which is in the Pſalme: for in annointing him, God made him a King. And yet wee muſt note therewithall what manner annointing this was: for we know that he was not annointed with viſible oile, but with the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Ghoſt.</p>
               <p n="28">28 <hi>That they might doe.</hi> I haue alreadie declared to what ende this is ſpoken: that the kingdome of Chriſt was ſo farre from being ouerrunne by that conſpiracie, that in truth it did then floriſh. Notwithſtanding herein is contained a ſingular doctrine, that God doth ſo gouerne and guide all things by his ſecrete counſel, that he doth bring to paſſe thoſe things which he hath determined, euen by the wicked. Not that they are readie willinglie to do him ſuch ſeruice, but becauſe he turneth their counſels &amp; attempts backward: ſo that on the one ſide appeareth great equitie and moſt great righteouſneſſe: on the other appeareth nought but wickedneſſe and iniquitie. Which matter we haue handled more at large in the ſecond Chapter. Let vs learne here by the way, that we muſt ſo conſider the prouidence of God, that wee knowe that it is the chiefe and onely guider of all thinges, which are done in the worlde: that the diuell and all the wicked are kept backe with Gods bridle, leaſt they ſhould doe vs any harme: that when they rage faſteſt, yet are they not at libertie to doe what they liſt, but haue the bridle giuen them, yet ſo farre forth as is expedient to exerciſe vs. Thoſe men which do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the foreknowledge of God alone, and yet confeſſe not that all things are done as it pleſeth him, are eaſily conuict by theſe words, That God hath appointed before that thing to be done which was done. Yea Luke being not contented with the worde <hi>counſel,</hi> addeth alſo <hi>hand,</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly, yet to the end he might the more plainely declare that the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uents of things are not onely gouerned by the counſell of God, but that they are alſo ordered by his power and hand.</p>
               <p n="29">29 <hi>And now O Lord.</hi> They doe very well extend that vnto themſelues, which they cited concerning Chriſt: becauſe hee will not bee ſeparated from the Goſpell: yea what trouble ſo euer befalleth his members, hee applieth that to his owne perſon. And they craue at Gods handes that hee will beate downe the crueltie of the aduerſaries: yet not ſo much for their owne ſake, that they may liue quietlie and without vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, as that they may haue libertie to preach the Goſpell in all places. Neither was it for them to deſire a life which they might, ſpende idlely, hauing forſaken their calling. For they adde, Graunt vnto thy ſeruauntes O Lorde, that they may ſpeake boldly. And by the way wee muſt note this ſpeech, that the Lorde woulde beholde their
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:7788:59" rendition="simple:additions"/> threatnings. For ſeeing it belongeth properly to him, to reſiſt the proud and to throw downe their loftie lookes: the more proudlie they bragge and boaſt, the more doe they vndoubtedly prouoke God to be diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with them, and it is not to be doubted but that God being offended with ſuch indignitie and crueltie,<note place="margin">Eſai. 37.14. &amp; 17.</note> will redreſſe the ſame. So Ezechias to the end he may obtaine helpe in extremitie, declareth before the Lord the arrogancie of Senacherib and his cruell threatnings. Wherefore let the crueltie and reproches of our enimies rather ſtirre vp in vs a deſire to pray, than any whit diſcourage vs from going forward in the courſe of our office.</p>
               <p n="30">30 <hi>Graunt vnto thy ſeruants.</hi> Seeing that one myracle had ſtinged the enimie ſo ſore, howe is it that theſe holy men do deſire to haue new my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles done daily? Therefore we gather that hence, which I haue alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die touched, that they make ſo great account of the glorie of God, that in compariſon of this, they ſet light by all other thinges. They haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect vnto this one thing onely, that the power of God may be declared by myracles, which the godlie ought alwayes to deſire, although the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries burſt, and all the whole Hell doe rage. The ſame muſt wee alſo thinke of boldneſſe to ſpeake. They knewe that the wicked coulde abide nothing worſe, than the free courſe of the Goſpel: but becauſe they knowe that that is the doctrine of life, which God will haue pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed whatſoeuer befall: they doe vndoubtedly preferre the preaching thereof before all other thinges, becauſe it is acceptable to God. And we are taught that wee doe then rightlie acknowledge the benefites of God as we ought, if by this occaſion wee bee pricked forward to pray, that hee will confirme that which he hath begunne. The Apoſtles had ſhewed a token of heroicall fortitude: nowe againe they pray that they may bee furniſhed with boldneſſe. So Paule deſireth the faithfull, to pray vnto the Lorde that his mouth may bee opened, whereas notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his voyce did ſounde euery where. Therefore the more we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue our ſelues to be holpen by the Lorde, let vs learne to craue at the hands of God that we may goe forward hereafter:<note place="margin">Epheſ. 6.19.</note> and eſpecially ſeeing the free confeſſion of the Goſpel is a ſingular gift of God, we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually beſeech him to keepe vs in the ſame.</p>
               <p n="31">31 <hi>And when they had prayed.</hi> Luke declareth nowe that God did not onely heare this prayer, but did alſo teſtifie the ſame by a viſible ſigne from heauen. For the ſhaking of the place ſhoulde of it ſelfe haue done them ſmall good: but it tendeth to another ende, that the faithfull may knowe that God is preſent with them. Finallie it is nothing elſe but a token of the preſence of God. But the fruite followeth, for they are all filled with the holy ghoſt, and endowed with greater boldneſſe. Wee ought rather to ſtande vppon this ſeconde member. For whereas God did declare his power then by ſhaking the place, it was a rare and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie thing: and whereas it appeared by the effect, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles did obtaine that which they deſired, this is a perpetuall profite of prayer, which is alſo ſet before vs for an example.</p>

               <p n="34">34 <hi>For ſo manie as were.</hi> Although this bee an vniuerſall ſpeech, yet is it all one as if it were indefinite. And aſſuredly it is to be thought, that there were manie which did not diminiſh their poſſeſſions, and that may be gathered out of the text. For when he ſpeaketh of Ioſes anone, vndoubtedly hee meant to note a notable example paſſing all others. Therefore hee ſaieth, that all did that which manie did euerie where. Neither doth this diſagree with the common vſe of the Scripture. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine he meaneth not that the faithful ſolde all that they had, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo much as neede required. For this is ſpoken for amplifications ſake, that the rich men did not only relieue the pouertie of their brethren of the yerelie reuenue of their landes, but they were ſo liberall, that they ſpared not their lands. And this might bee, though they did not robbe themſelues of all, but onely a little diminiſh their reuenues. Which wee may gather againe out of the woords of Luke: For hee ſaieth that this was the end, that no man might lack. He ſheweth further that they vſed great wiſdome: bicauſe it was diſtributed as euery man had need. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the goods were not equally deuided, but ther was a diſcrete diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution made, leſt anie ſhould be out of meaſure oppreſſed with pouertie. And peraduenture Ioſes hath this commendation giuen him by name, becauſe he ſold his onely poſſeſſion. For by this meanes hee paſſed all the reſt. Hereby it appeareth what that meaneth, that no man counted any thing his owne, but they had all things common. For no man had his owne priuatly to himſelfe, that he alone might enioy the ſame, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting others: but as neede required, they were readie to beſtow vpon al men. And now we muſt needs haue more then yron bowels: ſeing that wee are no more moued with the reading of this hiſtorie. The faithfull did at that day giue abundantly euen of that which was their owne: but wee are not onely content at this day wickedly to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:7788:60"/> Apoſtles feete: we feare not with ſacrilegious boldneſſe to conuert that to our owne vſe, which was offered to God. They ſold in times paſt their poſſeſſions: there reigneth at this day an vnſatiable deſire to buy. Loue made that common to the poore and needie, which was proper to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man: ſuch is the vnnaturalnes of ſome men now, that they cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide that the poore ſhould dwell vpon the earth, that they ſhoulde haue the vſe of water, aire, and heauen. Wherefore theſe things are written for our ſhame &amp; reproch. Although euen the poore themſelues are too blame for ſome part of this euill. For ſeeing goods cannot be common after this ſort, ſaue onely where there is a godly agreement, and where there reigneth one heart and one ſoule: manie men are either ſo proud, or vnthankfull, or ſlouthfull, or greedie, or ſuch hypocrites, that they do not onely ſo much as in them lyeth, quite put out the deſire to doe well: but alſo hinder habilitie.<note place="margin">Galath. 6.9.</note> And yet muſt we remember that admonition of Paul, that w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And whereas vnder colour of this, the Anabaptiſts and fantaſtical men haue made much adoe, as if there ought to be no ciuil property of goods amongſt Chriſtians, I haue alreadie refuted this folly of theirs in the ſecond Chapter. For neither doeth Luke in this place preſcribe a lawe to all men, which they muſt of neceſſitie follow, whiles that he reckoneth vp what they did, in whom a certaine ſingular efficacie and power of the holy Spirit of God did ſhew it ſelfe: neither doth hee ſpeake generally of all men, that it can bee ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered that they were not counted Chriſtians which did not ſell all that they had.</p>

               <p n="1">1 Thoſe thinges which Luke hath reported hitherto, did ſhewe that that companie which was gathered togither vnder the name of Chriſt was rather a companie of Angels than of men. Moreouer that was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible vertue, that the rich men did diſpoile themſelues of their owne accord, not onely of their money, but alſo of their land, that they might relieue the poore. But now he ſheweth that Satan had ine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nted a ſhift to get into that holy companie: &amp; that vnder color of ſuch excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vertue.
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:7788:61"/> For he hath wonderfull wiles of hypocriſie to inſinuate himſelfe. This way doth Sathan aſſault the Church, when as he cannot preuaile by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen war. But wee muſt ſpecially in this place haue reſpect vnto the drift of the holy Ghoſt. For in this hiſtorie he meant to declare, firſt how ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable ſingleneſſe of heart is to God, and what an abhomination hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie is in his ſight: ſecondly howe greatlie hee alloweth the holy and pure policie and gouernment of his Church. For this is the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall point, the puniſhment wherewith God puniſhed Ananias and his wife. As the greatneſſe thereof did at that time terrifie them all, ſo it is vnto vs a teſtimonie, that God cannot abide this vnfaithfulneſſe, when as bearing a ſhew of holines where there is none, we do mocke him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptibly. For if hauing weighed all the circumſtances, we be deſirous to know the ſumme: Luke condemneth no other fault in Ananias, than this, that he meant to deceiue God and the Church with a faigned of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering. Yet there were more euils packed vnder this diſſimulation: the contempt of God, whom he feareth not, though hee knewe his wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: ſacrilegious defrauding, becauſe hee keepeth backe parte of that which hee profeſſed to bee holy to God: peruerſe vanitie and ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe hee vaunteth himſelfe in the preſence of men without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing any reſpect vnto Gods iudgement: want of faith, becauſe he would neuer haue gone this way to worke, vnleſſe he had miſtruſted God: the corrupting of a godlie and holy order: furthermore the hypocriſie it ſelf was a great offence of it ſelfe. The fact of Ananias did beare a goodlie ſhew, although he had giuen onely the halfe of his lande. Neither is this a ſmall vertue, for a rich man to beſtow the halfe of his goods vpon the poore:<note place="margin">Prou. 15.8.</note> but the ſacrifices of the vngodly are an abhomination to God: neither can any thing pleaſe him, where the ſingleneſſe of heart is wanting.<note place="margin">Luke. 21.2.</note> For this cauſe is it that Chriſt maketh more account of the two mites offered by the widdowe, than of the great ſummes of others, who of their great heapes giue ſome part. This is the cauſe why God doth ſhewe an example of ſuch ſharpe puniſhment in Ananias. Nowe let vs note euerie point by it ſelfe. <hi>He laide</hi> it at the feete of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. Loe what ambition doth. Ananias is aſhamed, not to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted one of the beſt. therefore although hee be greedie of monie, yet to the ende he may purchaſe a name amongſt men, hee depriueth himſelfe of ſome part of his riches. In the meane while hee doeth not conſider that hee lyeth and diſceiueth in the ſight of God, and that God will pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh this lye. So it is, that he honoreth the Apoſtles feete, more than Gods eyes. Wherefore wee muſt take good heede, that when wee doe well, wee doe not ſeeke to bee praiſed of the by ſtanders: and it is not without cauſe that Chriſt ſaieth, that it is profitable for vs, when wee giue our almes, to haue the left hande ignorant of that which the right hand doth.</p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>And Peter ſaide.</hi> Howe did Peter knowe Ananias his fraude and purloigning? vndoubtedly by the reuelation of the Spirite. Therefore Luke ſignifieth vnto vs, that the Apoſtles did after a ſort repreſent gods perſon, and ſupplie his roome. If the Spirite of God by the mouth of a
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:7788:61"/> mortall man, do ſo ſore vrge an hypocrite, being otherwiſe painted with the beautifull colour of vertues, how ſhall the reprobate abide the voice of god himſelf, with the ſound of the tru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pet, when they ſhal appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his iudgement ſeat? Furthermore Peter pointeth out the cruelnes and horriblenes of the offence, by his queſtion, when he ſaith, that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan had filled the hart of Ananias. For there is no man whoſe hart is not pricked with the prickes of Satan: and all men are alſo many wayes tempted, yea theſe temptations pearce into their minds: but where Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan poſſeſſeth the hart, he reigneth in the whole man, hauing as it were expelled God. This is a ſigne of a reprobate, to be ſo addicted and giuen ouer to Satan, that the Spirit of God hath no place. That which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth afterward concerning lying, may haue a double ſenſe: either that he did falſely beare a ſhew of the Spirit, or that he lyed againſt the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. And in deede it is word for word <hi>Mentiri Spiritum:</hi> but foraſmuch as the Greeke word <hi>Pſeudeſthai</hi> is ioyned with a double accuſatiue caſe, &amp; that doth better agree with the text, I am rather of this minde, that Ananias is reprehended, becauſe he did lie falſely to the holy Ghoſt. Which he confirmeth ſhortly after, when he vpbraideth this vnto him, that he hath lyed vnto God and not vnto men. Wherefore we muſt take great heed, that hypocriſie reigne not in vs: which hath this wickednes proper to it, to goe about to diſceiue God, and as it were, <hi>cornicum oculos configere, to goe about to make blinde thoſe which are most wiſe:</hi> which cannot be without a diſloyall and vnſeemely mocke. Wherfore it is not without cauſe that Peter ſaieth, that where this commeth to paſſe, the heart is poſſeſſed of Satan. For who durſt (vnles he were void of reaſon) ſo blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme God? Therfore Peter asketh him as of ſome wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der: becauſe ſuch blindneſſe is horrible.</p>
               <p n="4">4 <hi>Did it not remaining.</hi> This amplifieth the offence, becauſe he ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned being enforced by no neceſſitie. For ſeeing it is no iuſt or lawful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe to haue been prouoked by ſome other meanes, how much worſe is it to run headlong vnto wickedneſſe willingly, and as it were of ſet pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to pull downe Gods vengeance? We gather out of this, that no man was enforced to ſell his goods or landes. For Peter ſaieth that Ananias had free libertie to keep both his land and his money: becauſe in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond member the field which was ſold, is take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the price it ſelf. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſhould neuertheles haue been counted faithfull, though he had kept that which was his owne. Whereby it appeareth that they are me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deſtitute of their right wits, who ſay that it is not lawful for the faithfull to haue any thing of their owne.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thou haſt not lied to men but to God.</hi> Although the wordes be diuerſly conſtrued, yet doe I not doubt but that this confirmeth the former ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. For hypocrites do ſo inwrappe themſelues in ſo many ſhifts, that they thinke they haue nothing to doe with God. And Peter ſpeaketh thus expreſly, becauſe Ananias had deceiued the church.<note place="margin">Mat. 18.20.</note> But he ought to haue conſidered, that, Where two or three bee gathered together in the name of Chriſt, he is preſent there as the chief gouernour: yea hee ought to haue behaued himſelfe no other wiſe in that aſſemblie, than if
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:7788:62"/> he ſhould haue ſeene God with his eyes. For ſeeing that God wil reigne in the Church, if we giue him any reuerence, wee muſt reuerence that rule and gouernement religiouſly, which hee exerciſeth by his woorde. The Apoſtles were in deed men, but not priuate men:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 3.16. &amp; 17. &amp; 6.19</note> becauſe God had put them in his ſteede. Furthermore we muſt note, that he ſaith that he lieth to God, who doeth lie to the holy Ghoſt. For the diuinitie of the holy ghoſt is manifeſtly proued by this forme of ſpeech. In like ſort Paul ſaith: Yee are the Temples of God, becauſe his Spirite dwelleth in you. 1. Cor. the third Chapt.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <note place="margin">2. Cor. 2.16.</note>5 <hi>When Ananias heard theſe thinges.</hi> The death of Ananias doeth in deede declare and proue the force of the word, which Paul doth highly extoll: to wit, that it is the ſauour of death vnto death to thoſe which periſh. 2. Cor. 2. He ſpeaketh in deede of the ſpirituall death of the ſoule, but there was a viſible ſigne in the bodie of Ananias, of that puniſhment which cannot bee ſeene with the eies of men. Hee was not ſlaine with ſword, by force, nor hand, but was ſtriken deade with the onely hearing of the voice. When we heare this, let the threatnings of the Goſpel ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie vs, and humble vs in time, leaſt we alſo feele the like effect. For that which is ſpoken of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Eſaie. 11.4.</note> He ſhall ſlea the wicked with the breath of his mouth: doth not only appertaine to the heade of the wicked, but alſo to euery member. For thoſe which refuſe the ſaluation offered in his word, it muſt needs be deadly to them, which was naturally wholſome. But and if any man doe thinke it an abſurd thing, that the Apoſtle did puniſh A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanias bodily: Firſt I anſwere that this was an extraordinarie thing: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly that this was one of the gifts of the Spirit: as it appeareth by the 12.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 12.10</note> Chapter of the firſt to the Corinthians. After which ſort we ſhall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward ſee Elimas the ſorcerer ſtriken with blindneſſe by Paul. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Peter did nothing which was impertinent to his function,<note place="margin">Actes. 13.8.</note> when hee did in time ſhoote that dart which the holy Ghoſt had giuen him. And whereas ſome thinke that this was too cruell a puniſhment, this commeth to paſſe, becauſe weighing Ananias his ſinne in their owne and not in Gods ballance, they count that but a light offence which was a moſt great and grieuous crime, being full of ſuch hainos offences, as I haue alreadie declared. Otherſome doe thinke that this was nothing ſo, becauſe they ſee many hypocrites eſcape ſcotfree daily, which do no leſſe mocke God than did Ananias: yea, becauſe they themſelues being moſt groſſe contemners of God, are yet notwithſtanding vnpuniſhed for their wickedneſſe. But as God hath powred out viſible graces vppon his Church in the beginning, to the ende we may know that hee will be preſent with vs by the ſecrete power of his ſpirite: yea hee ſhewed that openly by externall ſignes, which wee feele inwardly by the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of faith: ſo hee declared by the viſible puniſhment of two, howe horrible a iudgement remaineth for all hypocrites, which ſhall mocke God and his Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And there came great feare.</hi> This was the Lordes purpoſe, by puniſhing one, to make the reſt afraide, that they might reuerently beware of all hypocriſie. And that which Luke ſaieth, that <hi>they feared,</hi> doeth apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:7788:62"/> vnto vs alſo. For God meant to giue all ages a leſſon at that time: that they may learne to deale ſyncerely and vprightly with him. In the meane ſeaſon, the puniſhment of this wicked perſon ought to haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged the godlie heereafter to conſecrate their goods more freely to God and the poore: becauſe they might gather howe precious almes was in the ſight of God, ſeeing the profaning thereof was ſo puniſhed.</p>

But ſhee in holding on ſo careleſly, doeth declare that ſhee was vncureable: becauſe ſhee is touched with no feare of God. And heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by are wee taught to labour diligently to bring ſinners into the way. For the ſpirite of God keepeth this moderation: but when as ſtubbernneſſe and the ſtubberne contempt of God is added vnto the offence, it is now high time to puniſh. Therefore thoſe men are too arrogant who are diſpleaſed with the immoderate rigour of God. It is rather our duetie
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:7788:63" rendition="simple:additions"/> to conſider how we ſhall in time to come ſtande before the iudgement ſeat of God. Although this is too much to deſpiſe his holie power &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie, if we will haue him mocked freely without any puniſhment. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, ſo many circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtances which before I haue gathered, do ſufficiently proue that Ananias and Sapphira were not worthie of one death only. For firſt of all hypocriſie is of it ſelf very abhominable to God: ſecondly whereas they are determined to lie vnto God, this ariſeth of great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt in that they do not reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce &amp; fear Chriſt being the chief gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of thoſe amongſt whom they were, it is vngodlines ioyned with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudencie: becauſe, ſo they can eſcape ſhame and reproch amongſt men, before whom they were determined to vaunt &amp; brag, they paſſe not to denie their manifeſt wickedneſſe vnto God. Whereas they do ſtubbern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly denie their offence, this doth as it were, make vp the heape and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. And whereas innumerable hypocrites do no leſſe mocke God and the church daylie, who notwithſtanding are not puniſhed with death, I haue alreadie ſhewed why this ought to ſeeme to bee no inconuenient thing. For as much as God is the only iudge of the world, it belongeth to him to puniſh euery man at his pleaſure, when &amp; how it ſeemeth good to him. Wherefore wee may not preſcribe vnto him a certaine meane &amp; maner of puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. But the greatnes of the ſpiritual iudgement which is as yet hid, hath been ſet before vs, in the bodily puniſhment of two, as in a mirrour.

For he came to ſaue the world, and not to condemne it. Therefore whereas the ſicke are healed, and other are deliuered from diuels, theſe benefites done to the bodie, doe repreſent the ſpirituall grace of Chriſt: and therefore they agree with his natural office, that I may ſo ſpeake. That feareful ſigne which was ſhewed in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanias and Saphira, came to paſſe exraordinarilie. Luke ſaieth that the church was encreaſed by myracles, becauſe they ſerue for faith (as wee haue ſaid) to prepare ſome, to confirme other ſome. Whereby that is proued againe, which I haue ſaid els where, that myracles muſt neuer be ſeparated from the word. Luke ſheweth the multitude of myracles by this, in that the ſicke were brought foorth euerie where, that they might bee healed. For God meant thus to ſet foorth the Goſpel of his ſonne, eſpeciallie at the beginning: that he might for a certaintie teſtifie to the Iewes, that that reſtoring of all thinges was preſent, which was ſo often promiſed, and in which all their hope was repoſed, as they themſelues did pretende, and make ſemblance. It is welknowne that Couches were certaine little beddes in which the men of olde were woont to reſt at noone. Becauſe they might the more eaſily carrie them out, they laide the ſicke in them.</p>

For euerie man liued at home at his owne houſe, but they had their meetings there, as aſſuredly no bodie of the Church can otherwiſe continue. For if euery man wil be his owne teacher, and pray apart by himſelf, and if there be no meetings &amp; aſſemblies, how excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentlie ſo euer the Church be ordered and appointed, yet muſt it needs

               <p n="28">28 The chiefe Prieſt layeth two crimes to the charge of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. For hee accuſeth them of contumacie or ſtubbornneſſe, becauſe they obeyed not the decree of the Councell. In the ſecond member he bewrayeth an euill conſcience, or at leaſt he ſheweth that he handeled rather a priuate buſineſſe then any publike cauſe. For he complaineth that the Apoſtles will cauſe the Prieſtes and the Scribes to be hated for the death of Chriſte. Beholde therefore, what that is which netteleth them, becauſe they feare the reuenge and puniſhment of wicked mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Hee pretendeth at the firſt doctrine: but we may gather out of the ende, that hee was not ſo carefull for doctrine. In the meane ſeaſon hee accuſeth the Apoſtles of ſedition: for he taketh that for a thing which all men for the moſt part did graunt: that Chriſt was put to death iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie. Notwithſtanding this is the pincipall point of the accuſation, that they did not obey the commaundement of the Prieſtes. It was an haynous offence not to obey the chief Prieſt: how much more haynous was it then to deſpiſe the whole order? But the chiefe Prieſt doeth not conſider what is his dutie towarde God and the Church: he abuſeth his authoritie tyrannouſly, as if the ſame were not vnder any lawes. As the Pope dealeth with vs at this day. For ſeeing that hee taketh to himſelfe an vnbrideled authoritie &amp; gouernment, he feareth not to condemne vs for Schiſmatikes, ſo ſoone as he ſeeth vs refuſe his decrees. For hee cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth at theſe ſentences. He which deſpiſeth you, deſpiſeth me:<note place="margin">Luke. 10.16</note> &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he concludeth that we will rebel againſt God. But if hee will bee hearde as the ambaſſadour of Chriſt, he muſt ſpeake out of the mouth of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Nowe foraſmuch as he doth manifeſtly play the miniſter of Satan: he boroweth authoritie without ſhame and colour, of the name of Chriſte:
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:7788:67"/> Yea the very forme of ſpeech which the chiefe Prieſt vſeth, doth proue, how careleſly ſpirituall tyrants, who vſurp ſuch authoritie and Lordſhip as is not ſubiect to the word of God, dare graunt libertie to themſelues to attempt whatſoeuer pleaſeth them.

God commaundeth vs to beare witnes of Chriſt: therfore it is in vain for you to commaund vs to keepe ſilence. But I haue declared before in the third chap. when this ſentence taketh place, that we ought rather to obey God than men: God doth ſet men o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vs in ſuch ſort with power, that he keepeth ſtil his own autoritie fafe &amp; ſound. Therfore we muſt obey rulers ſo far, that the commandement of God be not broken. Wheras power &amp; authoritie is lawfully vſed, then it is out of ſeaſon to make compariſon between god &amp; man.

For he which goeth beyond his bounds in his office (becauſe he ſetteth bimſelf againſt God) muſt bee diſpoyled of his honour, leaſt vnder a colour or viſure hee deceiue. The office of a Paſtour is verie excellent, the authoritie of the Churche is great, yet ſo that no parre of Gods power and, Chriſtes maſterſhippe bee diminiſhed. Whence wee may eaſilie gather that the pryde of the

               <p n="30">30 <hi>The God of our fathers.</hi> They diſcende vnto the matter whereof they are to ſpeake, that they may declare that they made ſmall account of the commandement of the prieſtes, not without cauſe ne yet vnadui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly. For (as I haue alreadie ſaid) the compariſon between God &amp; man taketh no place ſaue onely when there is ſome contrarietie. Therefore they proue by this, that they are inforced by the fear of god to refuſe the commandement of the prieſts: becauſe God commaundeth that which they forbid. Therfore firſt of all they ſay that God had raiſed vp Chriſt, after the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cuſtome of the ſcriptures. For this ſpeech is common, that God rayſed vp prophetes or iudges, or rather miniſters, whom hee determined to vſe vnto ſome great worke: which importeth as much as that all excellencie of nature is weak, vnleſſe God do furniſh thoſe with ſingular giftes, whom he preferreth vnto any excellent office. Peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture alſo they allude vnto that famous place of Moſes,<note place="margin">Deut. 18.15 before. 3.22</note> which Peter ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in his firſt ſermon. They cite the <hi>God of the fathers</hi> by name as the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, that they may declare that they bring in no new form of religion, neither yet will they enforce vpon the people any newe God. For they were to make anſwer to that falſe ſlaunder, that they went about to lead away the people from the law and the prophets. Not that they allow all that worſhip which was vſed by the fathers, as profane men are content with this onely argument, that the fathers taught thus, that they doe all things according to the cuſtom and decree of their aunceſtours: but the Apoſtles ſpeak in this place of theſe <hi>fathers</hi> with whom God hath made his couenant, who followed right and pure doctrine, who imbraced the promiſe of ſaluation with true faith, finally, who had their beginning of the heauenly Father, &amp; who through the onely begotten ſonne of God were the children of God together with their poſteritie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whom ye.</hi> In this member the apoſtles declare vnto them plainly thar they were the enemies of god, who wold haue the chief honor giuen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as vnto the gouernours and prelates of the church.

But neither could death extinguiſh his power, neither could that ſhame and reproch which he ſuffered amongſt you, take away his honour.

The <hi>right hand of God</hi> is taken for his power. Neither is the ſame Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor vſed in this place, which we had before chap. 2. and which is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon elswhere, when Chriſt is ſaid to be lift vp vnto the right hand of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: but the meaning of this place is, that Chriſt which was ſlain by the hand of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, was lift vp on high by the power of God, that he might bear rule ouer angels and men. And this ſeemeth ſecretely to be ſet againſte al the enterpriſes of Satan &amp; the world: as if he ſhould ſay that they ſhal haue no good ſucceſſe, becauſe they ſhal neuer climbe ſo high, as to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the hand of God, whereby hee hath both wrought mightily alreadie in his only begotten Sonne, neither will he euer ceaſe to worke. Yet the end is added alſo, that he may be a captain &amp; Sauior. For ſo often as god did put his people in hope of ſaluation, he was wont to promiſe a prince or a king, by whoſe hand he would reſtore all things. The Apoſtles do te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie that this principalitie was graunted to Chriſt. Notwithſtanding they do more plainly expreſſe his office by the other adiunct. The ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me is this, that Chriſt is placed in the higheſt degree of honor, that he may gouerne the people of god: and not that only, but that he may ſhew him ſelf to be a ſauing captain, or the authour of ſaluation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To giue repentance.</hi> They ſhew in this place howe Chriſte reigneth to ſaue the people: to wit, when he bringeth his own to repentance, &amp; doth reconcile them vnto God through the remiſſion of ſinnes. Furthermore we know that the ſumme of the goſpel is contained in theſe two things. Wherefore the Apoſtles do not onely ſtand vppon the defence of their cauſe, but they preach the office of Chriſt plentifully, that they may win euen ſome of the mortall enemies of Chriſt, if it may be. Furthermore, wee haue declared before, what the word <hi>repentance</hi> doth ſignifie: to wit, that it is an inward turning of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto god, which ſheweth it ſelf after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by external workes. For Chriſt giueth vs the Spirit of regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for this cauſe, that he may renue vs inwardly: to the ende that a new life may afterward follow the newneſſe of the minde and heart. And if it belong to Chriſt to giue repentaunce, then it followeth that it is not a thing which is in mans power. And ſurely ſeeing that it is a certaine wonderfull reformation or faſhioning again, which maketh vs new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, repayreth in vs the image of God, bringeth vs out of the bondage of ſin, vnto the obedience of righteouſneſſe: it is a thing as impoſſible for men to conuert themſelues, as to create themſelues. Repentaunce is I graunt a voluntarie conuerſion, but whence haue we this will, ſaue on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe God chaungeth our heart,<note place="margin">Ezec. 11.19</note> that it may hee made fleſhie of a ſtonie heart: flexible of hard and ſtubborne: and finally, right of wicked? And this commeth to paſſe when Chriſt regenerateth vs by his Spirite. Neither is this giuen in a moment, but it muſt bee increaſed dailie du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring our whole life: vntill we be fully ioyned to God: which ſhal be then, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we haue put off our fleſh. This is in deed the beginning of repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce when a man who before was turned away from God, renounceth the
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:7788:68" rendition="simple:additions"/> world, and himſelfe, and doth purpoſe to lead a newe life. But becauſe when wee haue entred the way, wee are farre from the marke, wee muſt needs goe forward continually. Wee haue both, through the benefit of Chriſt. For as he beginneth repentaunce in vs, ſo doeth hee alſo giue vs perſeuerance. This is an ineſtimable grace: but it ſhould doe vs but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle good, vnleſſe it were coupled with forgiueneſſe of ſinnes. For Chriſte doth both finde vs the enemies of God at the firſt, and alſo there are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes vices remaining in vs, which cauſe diſagreement between him &amp; vs: ſo that he may iuſtly be offended with vs, rather than mercifull vnto vs. And therein doeth our righteouſneſſe conſiſt, if God doe not impute our ſinnes vnto vs. Therefore this latter grace muſt neuer bee ſeparated from the former. Yea rather the Goſpell ſhall be lame and corrupt, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it conſiſt vpon theſe two members, that is, vnleſſe men bee taught, that they are reconciled to God by Chriſte, by the free imputation of righteouſneſſe, and that they are faſhioned againe vnto newneſſe of life by the Spirit of regeneration. So that wee vnderſtand briefly howe wee muſt obtaine ſaluation in Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="32">32 <hi>And we are his witneſſes.</hi> After that they haue declared that their doctrine came from god, they diſcend now vnto the other part: that they ſpeake as they were commaunded by god, leaſt they ſeeme to attempt any thing vnaduiſedly. For this alſo was a neceſſarie defence: as it is for all the miniſters of the Goſpell: to wit, that they make this openly kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen to all men, that they teach nothing but that which they haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of God. Secondly, that they are called hereunto, ſo that they cannot auoide the neceſſitie of teaching vnleſſe they will reſiſt God. Luke put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth <hi>wordes</hi> in this place in ſteede of things, according to the Hebrewe phraſe. Although if any man had rather vnderſtand it of the ſpeech it ſelf, I doe not denie but that it may be ſo. The ſumme is, ſeeing they are brought forth by God to be witneſſes, they may not giue back, but they muſt publiſh that which he hath commaunded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And alſo the ſpirit.</hi> They confirm their calling by the effect. For this was as a ſeale to approue their doctrine, ſeeing that God gaue the holie Spirit to thoſe which beleeued. For as much as it appeared manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by this that hee allowed the faith of the Goſpel, and it was accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to him. In that they ſay, <hi>to thoſe which obey him,</hi> I referre it vnto Chriſt: as if they ſhuld haue ſaid, Thoſe which beleeue in Chriſt, are plen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tifully rewarded for their obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. Therfore god wil haue Chriſt obeied wherfore eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our miniſterie doth pleaſe him in that thing. Yet here may a queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be moued, ſeing that we haue faith by the reuelatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſpirit how is it ſaid in this place that the ſame is giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> after faith? I anſwer, that the gift of tongues, of propheſie, of interpretation, of healing, and ſuche like, are ſpoken of in this place, wherwith god did beautifie his Church. As Paul ſaith, wher he asketh the Galathia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, Whether they receiued the Spirit by the law or by the hearing of faith. Therfore the illumination of the ſpirit goth before faith, bicauſe it is the cauſe therof:<note place="margin">Gal. 3.2. Mat. 13.12.</note> but there folow other graces afterward, that we may go forward: according to that, To him that hath, ſhal be giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And if we will be enriched euer now &amp; then
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:7788:69"/> with new giftes of the Spirite, let vs holde out vnto God the lappe of faith. But the reward wherwith our want of faith is rewarded at this day, is farre vnlike, for the moſt part beeing deſtitute of the Spirite of God: doth neither ſee nor vnderſtand any thing.</p>
               <p n="33">33 <hi>They were cut inſunder.</hi> The Prieſtes ought to haue beene tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly moued though they had had harts of yron: but they burſt.

They woulde gladly mocke all the Goſpell: as they attempt whatſoeuer they canne, that they may count it as nothing: but there is in the ſame a certaine hidden maieſtie, which driueth away mightilie all their delicacie.

               <p n="34">34 Luke ſheweth nowe after what manner God brought to nought that furie of the wicked. They were purpoſed to put the Apoſtles to death: Gamaliel ſtandeth vp amidſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to break off that mad conſultati<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on. Furthermore, hee noteth the circumſtaunces, to the ende wee may knowe how it could be, that one man could preuaile ſo much againſt ſo many. Hee ſaieth hee was a Phariſee, which ſect was in great eſtimation as we knowe. Hee ſaieth that hee was in <hi>price</hi> or honoured amongeſt the people: And they feared the people. Heereby it commeth to paſſe that they are the more afraide to doe anye thinge contrary to
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:7788:69"/> his minde. So God doeth oftentimes ſet ſuddain terrors againſt his ene<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mies (when they looke not for them) to ſtaye their violence. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more Gamaliel commaundeth the Apoſtles to goe aſide, leaſt they ſhould be the more imboldned by his words. For we muſt not think that he ſpake thus, becauſe he did allowe the doctrine of the Goſpel, or that he meant to defende the ſame: but becauſe he ſaw all the reſt enflamed with furie, hee being a man moderate and courteous, doeth with ſober ſpeech temper that exceſſe. But if we conſider all things well, this iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and opinion is vnmeete for a wiſe man. I knowe that many count it as an Oracle: but it appeareth ſufficiently heereby that they iudge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe, becauſe by this meanes men ſhould abſtain from al puniſhments, neither were any wicked fact any longer to be corrected. Yea all helpes of life were to be refuſed, which we cannot prolong one moment. Both things are true, that no indeuours of men can deſtroy that which is of God: and that that which is of men, is not ſo ſtronge that it can ſtande. But he gathereth amiſſe hence, that men muſt ſit ſtill and ſay nothing in the meane ſeaſon. We muſt rather marke what God commaundeth vs to doe: and he will haue vs to reſtraine wickednes. To this ende hath he appointed Magiſtrates, and armed them with the ſword. To this end hath he ſet Elders ouer his Church, to bring the froward in order, and that they may not ſuffer ſinne licentiouſly to rage without puniſhment. Therefore it is gathered amiſſe, that wee muſt refraine from puniſhing becauſe God is ſufficient of himſelfe, to take away euils. Although his whole counſell is ſuch. Gamaliel willeth the Scribes and Elders, to take heed that they make not open warre againſt God. And he ſpeaketh as it were touching a doubtfull matter. Whereby it appeareth that he hath no certaintie from the foundation: when as he doubteth in the qualitie of the cauſe, neither dare ſet downe whether it be good or euil, but doth onely commaund to deferre it for a time, vntill the cauſe appeare more plainely. In ſumme, Gamaliel fetteth an euill conſequent from true grounds: becauſe he applieth that amiſſe vnto the externall office and manner of doing, which ought to ſerue for faith onely. On the other ſide, let this bee our Logike, That which is of God, muſt needes ſtande though all the whole world ſay nay: therefore faith muſt ſtand without all feare againſt all the aſſaults of Satan and men, ſeeing faith is vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propped and ſupported with the eternall truth of God: although hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen fal, our ſaluation is ſafe, which hath God to be the author and kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per thereof: becauſe God doeth defende the kingdome of Chriſt, it can neuer bee ouerthrowne with any violence: becauſe the doctrine of the Goſpel is grounded in God, howſoeuer men reſiſt or ſhake the ſame, yet ſhall it neuertheleſſe continue firme. Againe, although the wicked at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt whatſoeuer they can, and ſeeke al meanes to deſtroy the church, although they furiouſly ſtriue againſt Chriſt and his Church ſo much as they are able, yet they ſhall not preuaile, becauſe it is the propertie of God to bring the counſels of men to naught: and by this meanes doeth he puniſh their raſhneſſe. We ſee that both members are well applied to faith. But in the meane ſeaſon there is no cauſe why the ſeruauntes of
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:7788:70"/> Chriſt ſhould be leſſe diligent in maintaining the truth: why they ſhould ſuffer the Church to decay through their fault: why they ſhoulde care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly winke at their wickedneſſe who endeuor to turne all thinges topſie turuie.</p>
               <p n="36">36 <hi>There aroſe one Theudas.</hi> If we credit Ioſephus, Gamaliel altereth in this place the true courſe of the hiſtorie. For hee reporteth that Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das Gaulanites, who was borne in Gamala, at ſuch time as <hi>Quirinius,</hi> or <hi>Cyrenius</hi> was Proconſull, did raiſe a tumult with his adherentes, becauſe they woulde not haue their goods taxed: and that <hi>Theudas</hi> at ſuch time as <hi>Cuſpius Fadus</hi> was Procuratour, did boaſt that hee was a Prophet of God. And <hi>Fadus</hi> was ſent into Iudea by <hi>Claudius Caeſar.</hi> The former hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorie is recorded in the eighteenth booke of Antiquities: and the other in the twentith. But I thinke that when Luke ſaith, <hi>After him was there one Iudas:</hi> he meant not to note the courſe of time as if he were the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: but foraſmuch as Gamaliel brought in two like examples, he might put the one in place of the other, without hauing reſpect of time. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the worde <hi>post,</hi> is as much as Moreouer, or beſides. Furthermore e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen theſe examples wherewith Gamaliel confirmeth his opinion, doe not ſufficiently agree with the preſent cauſe. For, becauſe they did not by and by reſiſt Iudas, that ſedition which he had raiſed, was the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of many murthers, and at length he was vanquiſhed with hand and weapon. Theudas alſo had done farre more hurt, vnleſſe he had beene put to flight in time by <hi>Cuſpius Fadus.</hi> But Gamaliel hath reſpect vnto this alone, that men haue vnlucky ſucceſſe when as they auance themſelues vnaduiſedly: and that commeth to paſſe by the iuſt iudgement of God. But becauſe the Prieſtes refuſe to harken when God giueth them good cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel, they are worthy to be made amaſed by ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with friuilous reaſons, wauering hither &amp; thither through fooliſh perplexitie. Furthermore if wee caſt the time, wee ſhall finde that it was twelue yeeres at leaſt after the death of Chriſt, before the Apoſtles were beaten. For vnto the fiue yeeres, which remained of the gouernement of <hi>Tyberius,</hi> we muſt adde three and one halfe, which <hi>Caligula</hi> reigned. <hi>Fadus</hi> was not ſent by Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius into Iudea, before the ſecond or thirde yeere of his reigne. Gama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liel rehearſeth not the act within a day or two after. Therefore that ſpace of time is complete whereof I ſpake. Wherefore the conſtancie of the Apoſtles was the more excellent, who though they bee ſo euill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded for thoſe longe paines which they had endured, yet are they not diſcouraged, neither doe they ceaſe to holde on as they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne.</p>

Neuertheleſſe we ſee howe farre Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maliel is from true knowledge, who compareth the holy Miniſters of Chriſt vnto ſeducers and robbers: although hee mitigateth his words afterwarde, and inclining towarde the better part, leaueth it indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, whether they haue taken this matter in hande hauing God for
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:7788:70"/> their authour or noe. Yet hee ſpeaketh doubtfullie, becauſe hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uideth onely for quietneſſe, all enquirie being ſet a parte.

And it appeareth alſo what euill ſucceſſe thoſe doubtfull counſels haue, wherein men alone are reſpected, and the trueth of God ſet aſide. Gamaliel obteineth thus much, that the liues of the Apoſtles may be ſaued, but in the meane ſeaſon, the ſonne of God is blaſphemed &amp; ſlaundered in their perſon. The truth of the Goſpel is buried in eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſilence, ſo much as in the enimies lyeth. God ſurely doth by this meanes wonderfully ſpread abroad his worde: yet that counſel ceaſeth not to be euill. Which we muſt note for this cauſe, becauſe moſt men at this day doe thinke, that they doe not a little obey God, if they ſaue the liues of thoſe men which come in hazard for the doctrine of the Goſpel, or ſomewhat appeaſe the enimies who are otherwiſe bloodie: in the meane ſeaſon they are not afraide to driue them vnto the wicked deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of Chriſt, the confeſſing of whom is farre more precious in the ſight of God, then the life of all men.

So the faithfull muſt bee two manner of wayes affectioned ſo often as they ſuffer perſecution for the Goſpel, they muſt bee touched with the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſſe of puniſhmentes, yet ſo that they ouercome this ſorrowe with ſpirituall ioy.

                  <hi>That they were counted worthie.</hi> This might ſeeme at the firſt bluſh ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurde, in that Luke placeth honour in reproch: but the diſagreement which is betweene God and the worlde cauſeth this, that that which is counted amongſt men moſt reprochfull, excelleth in dignirie and glory in the ſight of God &amp; his angles. We know that the kind of death which Chriſt ſuffered, was of all other moſt ſhamefull, and yet did he triumph moſt noblie vpon the croſſe: ſo when we are made like vnto him, we may worthily boaſt that it is a point of ſingular excellencie, that we ſuffer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke in the ſight of the worlde.<note place="margin">Galat. 6.17.</note> Thus doeth Paul boaſt of the markes of Chriſt. For wee muſt heere reſpect the cauſe, which doeth aſſociat vs vnto Chriſt, who doth not onely ſwallow vp the ſhame of the world with his glorie, but doth alſo turne reproches, ſlaunders, and mockes of the worlde into great honour. Wherefore it is no maruell that there bee ſo fewe found which are ſtronge &amp; ſtout to beare the croſſe, becauſe we are almoſt all drowned &amp; ouerwhelmed with the ſenſe of the fleſh: and there is ſcarſe one amongſt an hundreth which conſidereth that the reproch of Chriſt doth farre excell all the triumphes of the worlde, which is the onely matter of comfort.

               <p n="1">1 Luke declareth here vpon what occaſion, and to what ende, and alſo with what rite Deacons were firſt made. He ſaith, When there aroſe a murmuring amongſt the Diſciples, it was appeaſed by this remedie, as it is ſaid in the common prouerbe, Good lawes haue taken their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of euill manners. And it may ſeeme to be a ſtraunge thing, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that this is a function ſo excellent and ſo neceſſarie in the Church, why it came not into the Apoſtles mindes at the firſt, before there was any ſuch occaſion miniſtred, to appoint Deacons, and why the Spirite of God did not giue them ſuch counſell which they take nowe, being as it were enforced thereunto. But that which happened, was both better then, and is alſo more profitable for vs at this day, to bee vnto vs an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. If the Apoſtles had ſpoken of chuſing Deacons, before any neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie did require the ſame: they ſhould not haue had the people ſo ready: they ſhould haue ſeemed to auoid labour and trouble: many would not haue offered ſo liberally into the hands of other men. Therefore it was requiſite that the faithfull ſhoulde bee conuict by experience, that they might chooſe Deacons willingly, whom they ſaw they could not want: and that through their owne fault. We learne in this hiſtorie, that the Church cannot bee ſo framed by and by, but that there remaine ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to he amended, neither can ſo great a building bee ſo finiſhed in one day, that there may not ſomething be added to make the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. Furthermore we learne that there is no ordinance of God ſo holie and laudable, which is not either corrupt or made vnprofitable through the faulte of men. Wee woonder that thinges are neuer ſo well orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the worlde, but that there is alwayes ſome euill mixed with the good; but it is the wickedneſſe and corruption of our nature which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth this. That was indeede a godly order whereof Luke made menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on before, when the goods of all men being conſecrated to God, were diſtributed to euery man as hee had neede: when as the Apoſtles being as it were the ſtewardes of God and the poore, had the chiefe gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the almes. But ſhortly after there ariſeth a murmuring which trobleth this order. Here appereth that corruption of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wherof I haue ſpoken, which doeth not ſuffer vs to vſe our good things. Wee muſt alſo marke the ſubtiltie of Satan, who to the end he may take from vs the vſe of the giftes of God, goeth about this continually, that it may not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine pure and ſounde: but that being mixed with other diſcommodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, it may firſt be ſuſpected, ſecondly loathed, and laſtly quite taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. But the Apoſtles haue taught vs by their example that we muſt not yeelde vnto ſuch engines and policies of Satan. For they do not thinke it meete (being offended with the murmuring) to take away that mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery which they know pleaſeth God: but rather inuent a remedy where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the offence may be taken away, and that may bee retained which is Gods. Thus muſt we doe. For what offences ſoeuer Satan raiſe, we muſt
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:7788:72"/> take good heede that he take not from vs thoſe ordinances which are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe wholeſome.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The number encreaſing.</hi> We ought to wiſh for nothing more then that God woulde encreaſe his Church, and gather togither many on euerie ſide vnto his people: but the corruption of our nature hindereth vs from hauing any thing good or happie in all pointes. For there ariſe many diſcommodities alſo, euen of the encreaſings of the Church. For it is a harde matter to keepe many hypocrites from creeping into the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, whoſe wickedneſſe is not by and by diſcouered, vntill ſuch time as they haue infected ſome part of the flocke with their infection. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer many wicked, froward, &amp; diſſolute perſons, do inſinuate themſelues vnder a falſe colour of repentance. And that I may paſſe ouer innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable things, there is neuer ſuch agreement amongſt many, but that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the diuerſitie of their maners, their opinions are alſo diuers: ſo that one thing cannot pleaſe all alike. This offence cauſeth many to be deſirous to chooſe a few for a Church, it cauſeth them to loath or elſe to hate a multitude. But no trouble, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>A murmuring of the Greekes.</hi> Heereby it appeareth that they were not fully regenerate by the Spirite of God, to whom the diuerſitie of nation and countrie miniſtreth occaſion of diſagreement. For in Chriſt there is neither Iews nor Grecian: therefore this indignation ſmelleth of the fleſh and the world. Wherefore wee muſt take good heede that the like fault be not founde in vs. There is another faulte, in that they declare their indignation by murmuring. Furthermore it is vncertaine whether the complaint were true or no. For when Luke ſaieth that the Greekes murmured, becauſe their widowes were not honoured, he ſheweth not what was done indeed, but what they thought was done. And it may be that for as much as the Apoſtles did preferre the Iewes, becauſe they were better knowne, the Greekes did th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ke (though falſely) that their widowes were deſpiſed as ſtraungers. And this ſeemeth to bee more like to be true. Furthermore the worde <hi>ministring</hi> may bee expounded two manner of wayes, actiuely or paſſiuely. For wee knowe that at the firſt there were widowes choſen vnto the miniſtration. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding I doe rather thinke that the Greekes did complaine, becauſe their widowes were not ſo liberallie relieued as they wiſhed. So that the miniſtration ſhall bee that daylie diſtribution which was wont to be made.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>The twelue hauing called the multitude vnto them.</hi> It is a point of pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and meekenes that the Apoſtles are no more moued: It is a point of prudence and godly carefulneſſe, in that they preuent the euil which began to ariſe, without deferring the remedie. For after that euery diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſion and diuiſion hath gathered ſtrength, it is a wound hard to be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. By this aſſemblie it appeareth that the Church was gouerned by order and reaſon, ſo that the Apoſtles had the chiefeſt authoritie, and
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:7788:72" rendition="simple:additions"/> that yet they did impart their counſels and purpoſes vnto the people. Againe wee muſt note that the faithfull or Chriſtians are in this place called diſciples, in wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>It pleaſeth not.</hi> It is in Greeke <hi>ouc areston.</hi> By which word the Grecians do nowe expreſſe euery opinion or decree which is better then other, or which is to be preferred as being better. I doe rather thinke that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles declare what is profitable, than ſimplie what they haue decreed. But if it bee not expedient for them to meddle with this buſineſſe, they ſeeme not to acknowledg ſome fault in that that they miniſtred hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. And ſurely that is true, that, Vſe is the father of wiſedome. Wherfore there ſhall be no abſurditie, if we ſhal ſay, that the Apoſtles deſire of the Church to bee vnburdened of that function, after that they haue tried that it is not meete for them. But if there were any fault, it ought rather to be aſcribed vnto neceſſitie, than vnto them. For they tooke not this burthen vpon them greedily, but ſeeing there was no other way as yet, they had leifer burthen themſelues out of meaſure, than that the poore ſhould be forſlowed. And when as they ſay that it is not meete that they ſhoulde bee occupied in prouiding for the poore, their meaning is that they are vnable to endure both burthens, ſo that they muſt needs let the one alone. For it is as if they ſhould ſay: If thou wilt enioy our miniſtery in the preaching of the Goſpel, deliuer vs from the charge of the poore, becauſe we are not able to do both. But this ſeemeth to be ſpoken out of ſeaſon by them, becauſe they had not left the charge of teaching be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, although they had the ouerſight of the almes. I anſwere, for as much as the adminiſtration was confuſed, they were ſo inwrapped, that they could not wholy attend vpon doctrine, as was meete. Therefore they refuſe that function which draweth them away from the free and perfect charge of teaching. Notwithſtanding wee may not thinke that they had quite caſt away all care of the poore, but that they did onely ſeek ſomwhat to be lightned &amp; eaſed, that they might attend vpon their office. And in the meane ſeaſon they declare that the miniſterie of the word is ſo painefull, that it requireth a whole man, neither will it ſuffer him to be occupied about any other buſineſſe. Which if it had bene well conſidered, there had ben a farre other order taken in the Church. The popiſh biſhops did ſack vp great riches vnder colour of the miniſtration or deaco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſhip: neuertheles they intangled the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues in diuers buſineſſes: which they were ſcarſe able to ouercome though euery one of them had had ten heads. Notwithſtanding ſuch is their wickedneſſe that they ſay that there can be no church, vnleſſe it be drowned in this depth: neither do they ceaſe to brag &amp; boaſt that they are the ſucceſſors of the Apoſtles whereas there is nothing which appeareth to bee more contrary. They were carefull for this, that they might not bee occupied about ſeruing of tables, and ſo be compelled to leaue their owne bankets. For whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer is carefull for his owne table, hee taketh leaue to bee vacant from other mens tables. But omitting theſe things, let vs marke this ſentence.
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:7788:73" rendition="simple:additions"/> We know what a holy thing it is to be carefull for the poore. Therefore for as much as the Apoſtles prefer the preaching of the Goſpell before it, wee gather thereby that no obedience is m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding the hardnes is alſo declared, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as they ſay that they cannot diſcharge both theſe duties. Surely we are not better than they. Therefore let euery one of vs that is called vnto the functio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of teaching addict himſelfe whollie to order this his eſtate well. For we are inclined to nothing more than to fall to ſlouthfulnes. Again the fleſh miniſtreth goodly clokes and colours, ſo that thoſe men cannot ſee by and by that they are lead away from their calling, which inwrappe themſelues in ſtraunge buſineſſe. Wherefor to the end Miniſters may pricke forwarde themſelues to do their duetie, let them remember this ſaying of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles oftentimes, wherin they declare that foraſmuch as they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vnto the function of teaching, they muſt not any longer take charge of the poore. Therefore what excuſes haue prophane affaires (taken in hand euen for ſome priuate gaine) where that is ſet aſide which is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe accounted no ſmall part of the worſhip of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>Therefore brethren looke out.</hi> Now we ſee to what end Deacons were made: The worde it ſelfe is in deede generall, yet is it properly taken for thoſe which are ſtewards for the poore. Whereby it appeareth howe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenciouſly the Papiſts doe mocke God and men, who aſſigne vnto their Deacons no other office but this, to haue the charge of the patten and Chalice. Surelie we neede no long diſputation to proue, that they agree in no point with the Apoſtles. But if the readers bee deſirous to ſee anie more concerning this point, they may repaire vnto our Inſtitution. As touching this preſent place, the Church is permitted to chooſe. For it is tyrannous if any one man appoint or make miniſters, at his pleaſure. Therefore this is the moſt lawful way, that thoſe be choſen by common voices, who are to take vpon them any publike function in the Church. And the Apoſtles preſcribe what manner perſons ought to be choſen: to wit, men of tried honeſtie and credit, men endewed with wiſedome and other gifts of the Spirite. And this is the meane betweene tyranny and confuſed libertie, that nothing be done without the conſent and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of the people: yet ſo that the paſtours moderate and gouerne this action, that their authoritie may be as a bridle, to keepe vnder the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, leaſt they paſſe their bounds too much. In the meane ſeaſon this is worth the noting, that the Apoſtles preſcribe an order vnto the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, leaſt they appoint any ſaue thoſe which are fit. For wee doe God no ſmall iniurie, if wee take all that come to hande to gouerne his houſe. Therefore we muſt vſe great circumſpection, that we chooſe none vnto the holy function of the Church, vnleſſe we haue ſome triall of him firſt. The number of Seauen is applied vnto the preſent neceſſitie: leaſt any man ſhoulde thinke that there is ſome myſterie comprehended vnder the ſame. Whereas Luke ſaith, <hi>full of the Spirit</hi> and wiſdome, I do inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret it thus: that it is requiſite that they bee furniſhed both with other gifts of the Spirit, and alſo with wiſedome, without which that function cannot bee exerciſed well: both that they may beware of the liegerde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:7788:73" rendition="simple:additions"/> of thoſe men, who being too much giuen vnto begging, require that which is neceſſary for the pouertie of the brethren: and alſo of their ſlanders, who ceaſe not to backbite though they haue none occaſion gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen them. For that function is not onely painefull, but alſo ſubiect to manie vngodly murmurings.</p>
               <p n="4">4 <hi>And we will giue our ſelues vnto prayer.</hi> They ſhewe againe that they haue too much buſines otherwiſe, wherin they may exerciſe themſelues during their whole life. For the olde prouerbe agreeth hereunto verie fitlie, which was vſed ſometimes in the ſolemne rites, Doe this. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they vſe the word <hi>proſcartereſai,</hi> which ſignifieth to be as it were faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and tyed to any thing. Therefore Paſtours muſt not thinke, that they haue ſo done their dutie that they need to do no more, when they haue daily ſpent ſome time in teaching. There is another manner of ſtudy, another maner of zeale, another maner of continuance required, that they may in deede boaſt that they are wholie giuen to that thing. They adioyne thereunto prayer, not that they alone ought to pray (for that is an exerciſe common to all the Godly) but becauſe they haue peculiar cauſes to praie aboue all other. There is no man which ought not to be carefull for the common ſaluation of the Church, howe much more then ought the Paſtour, who hath that function enioyned him by name, to labour carefullie for it?<note place="margin">Exod. 17.11 Rom. 1.10. 1. Corin. 3.7.</note> So Moſes did in deede exhort o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers vnto prayer, but hee went before them as the ring leader. And it is not without cauſe that Paule doth ſo often make mention of his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Againe wee muſt alwayes remember that, that wee ſhall looſe all our labour beſtowed vppon plowing, ſowing and watering, vnleſſe the encreaſe come from heauen. Therefore it ſhal not ſuffice to take great paines in teaching, vnleſſe wee require the bleſſing at the hands of the Lord, that our labour may not bee in vaine and vnfruitfull. Heereby it appeareth, that the exerciſe of prayer is not in vaine commended vnto the miniſters of the word.</p>
               <p n="5">5 <hi>Stephen full of faith.</hi> Luke doth not therefore ſeparate faith from the Spirite, as if it alſo were not a gift of the Spirite: but by Spirit hee mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth other gifts wherewith Stephen was endewed, as zeale, wiſedome, vprightneſſe, brotherly loue, diligence, integritie of a good conſcience: ſecondly hee expreſſeth the principall kinde. Therefore he ſignifieth that Stephen did excell firſt in faith, and ſecondly in other vertues, ſo that it was euident that hee had abundance of the grace of the Spirite. He doth not ſo greatlie commende the reſt, becauſe vndoubtedly they were inferiour to him. Moreouer the auncient writers, doe with great conſent affirme that this Nicholas, which was one of the ſeauen, is the ſame of whom Iohn maketh mention in the Reuelation: to wit,<note place="margin">Apoca. 2.15</note> that hee was an authour of a filthie and wicked ſect: for as much as hee would haue women to be common. For which cauſe we muſt not be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in chooſing miniſters of the Church. For if the hypocriſie of men do deceiue euen thoſe, which are moſt vigilant and careful to take heed, what ſhall befall the careleſſe and negligent? Notwithſtanding if when we haue vſed ſuch circumſpection as is meete, it ſo fall out that wee bee
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:7788:74"/> deceiued, let vs not be trobled out of meaſure, for as much as Luke ſaith, that euen the Apoſtles were ſubiect to this inconuenience. Some will aske this queſtion, Then what good ſhall exhortation doe? to what vſe ſerueth prayer? ſeeing that the ſucceſſe it ſelfe ſheweth that the electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was not wholy gouerned by the Spirite of God? I anſwere, that this is a great matter that the Spirit directed their iudgements in chooſing ſixe men: in that he ſuffereth the Church to goe aſtray in the ſeuenth, it ought to ſeeme no abſurd thing. For it is requiſite that wee bee thus humbled diuers wayes, partly that the wicked and vngodly may exerciſe vs: partly that being taught by their example, wee may learne to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine our ſelues throughly, leaſt there bee in vs any hidden and priuie ſtarting corners of guile: partly that we may be more circumſpect to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerne, and that wee may as it were keepe watch continually, leaſt wee bee diſceiued by craftie and vnfaithfull men. Alſo it may bee that the miniſterie of Nicolas was for a time profitable, and that he fel afterward into that monſtrous error. And if ſo be it he fell in ſuch ſort from ſuch an honorable degree; the higher that euery one of vs ſhall bee extolled, let him ſubmit himſelfe vnto God with modeſtie and feare.</p>
               <p n="6">6 <hi>Hauing prayed they laide their hands vpon them.</hi> Laying on of handes was a ſolemne ſigne of conſecration vnder the Law. To this end do the Apoſtles now lay their hands vpon the Deacons, that they may knowe that they are offered to God. Notwithſtanding becauſe this Ceremonie ſhould of it ſelfe bee vaine, they adde thereunto prayer, wherein the faithfull commende vnto God, thoſe miniſters whom they offer vnto him. This is referred vnto the Apoſtles, for all the people did not lay their hands vpon the Deacons: but when the Apoſtles did make prayer in the name of the Church, others alſo did adde their petitions. Hence we gather that the laying on of hands is a rite agreeing vnto order and comlineſſe, for as much as the Apoſtles did vſe the ſame: and yet that it hath of it ſelfe no force or power, but that the effect dependeth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Spirite of God alone.

This was an excellent work of God that the church ſhould ſodainly, and as it were in a moment be raiſed vp: but this
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:7788:74" rendition="simple:additions"/> is worthy no leſſe admiration, in that he furthereth that work which he had begun amidſt ſo many lets, in that the number of thoſe is encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, whom to diminiſh, and ſo conſequently to deſtroy the whole ſtocke, the world doeth ſo greatly labour. In that he ſaieth that <hi>the worde of God</hi> did grow: his meaning is, that it was ſpread further abroade. The worde of God is ſaide to grow two manner of wayes, either when newe diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are brought to obey the ſame, or as euery one of vs profiteth and goeth forwarde therein. Luke ſpeaketh in this place of the former ſort of encreaſing, for hee expoundeth himſelfe by and by, when hee ſpeaketh of the number of the diſciples. Notwithſtanding hee reſtrei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth this ſo great an encreaſing of faith, vnto one Cittie. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it bee to bee thought, that the diſciples were ſcattered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad elſewhere, yet was there no certaine bodie ſaue onely at Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And a great companie.</hi> Seing that (in ſpeaking properly) our faith doth obey the doctrine of the Goſpell, it is a figuratiue ſpeach vttered by Metonymia, when Luke ſaieth, That they obeyed the faith. For the worde <hi>faith</hi> is taken by him for the worde of God, and the very profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Chriſtianitie. And he reckoneth vp the Prieſtes by name, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were for the moſt parte enimies: for which cauſe it was a woonderfull woorke of God, that ſome ſhoulde bee conuerted, and much more woonderfull that many. For at the firſt they raged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſte with this bragge, Hath anie of the rulers beleeued in him? But this multitude which knoweth not the Lawe, are accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And Stephen.</hi> Luke reciteth in this place a newe cumbate of the Church, whereby it appeareth that the glory of the Goſpel was alwaies ioyned with the croſſe and diuerſe troubles. And this is the ſumme, that the Church was aſſaulted in the perſon of one man. Whereby it came to paſſe, that the enimies were the more bolde, and being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewed with innocent bloode, did rage ſorer than they had wont. For they had not gone as yet beyond the priſon and roddes. But to the end we may knowe that the name of Chriſt was glorified as well in the life as in the death of Stephen, Luke ſaith at the firſt, that hee was <hi>full of faith</hi> and power. Whereby hee ſignifieth that his faith was excellent, and that he excelled in power to doe myracles. Neither ought wee to imagine perfection of faith, becauſe he is ſaide to bee full of faith: but this manner of ſpeaking, is much vſed in the Scripture, to call thoſe Full of the giftes of God, who are aboundantly endewed with the ſame. I take <hi>power</hi> (without queſtion) for habilitie to doe miracles. <hi>Faith</hi> comprehendeth not onely the gifte of vnderſtanding, but alſo the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentneſſe of zeale. For as much as his name was famous by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this excellencie, it came thereby to paſſe, that the rage of the wicked was bent againſt him as it were with one conſent to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe him. For ſo ſoone as the force and grace of the Spirite doeth ſhewe it ſelfe, the furie of Sathan is by and by prouoked.</p>
               <p>And it ſhall appeare by the text that Steephen was diligent and
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:7788:75"/> couragious in ſpreading abroade the doctrine of the Goſpel: but Luke paſſeth ouer that, being content to haue commended his faith; which could not be ſlothfull and ſluggiſh.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And there aroſe certaine.</hi> This was the beginning of perſecution, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the wicked after that they haue aſſaied in vaine to ſet themſelues againſt Chriſt by diſputing, when they ſaw that that former attempt did take none effect, they flie vnto ſlaunders, cauilling, and tumults, and at length they breake out into violence and murther. Therefore Luke meaneth by the worde <hi>Riſe,</hi> that thoſe of whom he ſpeaketh, did aſſault the Goſpel with their tongue, and did not by and by bring Stephen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the iudgement ſeate, but did firſt ſet vpon him by diſputing againſt him. Furthermore hee ſignifieth that they were ſtraungers, which li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in Iudea, either that they might exerciſe merchandiſe, or elſe get learning. Therefore he ſaith that ſome of them were <hi>Cyrenians,</hi> ſome of Alexandria, ſome of <hi>Cilicia,</hi> ſome of Aſia. He ſaith that they were all of the Synagogue of the Libertines. It is to be thought that the free men of the citizens of Rome had cauſed a ſynagogue to bee builded of their owne charges, that it might bee proper to the Iewes which came togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of the prouinces. Therefore thoſe which were brought thither by the grace of God, and ought to haue embraced Chriſt ſo much the more willingly, aſſault him firſt, and inflame the furie of others as it were with a trumpet. Alſo Luke will in many other places afterward declare, that the Iewes which were ſcattered abroad in the prouinces, were moſt deadlie enimies to ſounde doctrine, and moſt venemous in moouing tumults. Hee reckoneth vp manie, to the ende the victorie of the truth may be the more famous, whiles that many gathered of diuerſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, depart being vanquiſhed by one man, and it is not to bee doubted but that they were enforced to holde their peace with ſhame. Stephen had alreadie woone great fauor, and gotten great dignitie by myracles. He anſwereth the diſputers now in ſuch ſort, that hee getteth the vpper hande much. Hee putteth not that <hi>Wiſedome and Spirite</hi> which he ſaith his aduerſaries coulde not gaineſtande, as diuerſe thinges. Therefore reſolue theſe wordes thus: They coulde not reſiſt the wiſedome which the Spirite of God gaue him. For Luke meant to expreſſe, that they fought not on both ſides as men: but that the enimies of the Goſpell were therefore diſcouraged &amp; ouercome, becauſe they did ſtriue againſt the ſpirit of God, which ſpake by the mouth of Stephen. And foraſmuch as Chriſt hath promiſed the ſame Spirite to all his ſeruants, let vs onely defende the truth faithfully, and let vs craue a mouth and wiſedome of him: and we ſhall be ſufficiently furniſhed to ſpeake, ſo that neither the wit, neither yet the babling of our aduerſaries ſhall bee able to make vs aſhamed. So the Spirit was as effectuall in our time, in the mouth of the Martyrs which were burnt, and it vttereth the like force nowe daily, that though they were ignorant men, neuer trained vp in any ſchooles, yet did they make the chiefe diuines which maintained poperie no leſſe aſtoniſhed with their voice onely, than if it had thundered and lighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>

Whereby it appeareth that they did ſtriue with an euill conſcience. For what can bee more vnmeete than in their cauſe to leane vnto lies? Admit hee were a wicked man, and guiltie, yet hee muſt not haue falſe witneſſe borne againſt him. But hypocrites which ſhrowde themſelues vnder zeale, doe careleſlie graunt themſelues leaue to doe that. Wee ſee how the Papiſtes at this day corrupt manifeſt places of Scripture, and that wittingly, whiles that they will falſely wreſt teſtimonies againſt vs. I confeſſe in deede that they offend for the moſt part through ignorance. Yet can we finde none of them which doeth not graunt himſelfe libertie to corrupt both the ſenſe and alſo the woordes of the Scripture, that they may bring our doctrine into contempt: yea they ſlaunder vs monſtrouſly euen in the Pulpit. If you aske theſe Rabbines, Whether it bee lawfull to ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a man or no: they will denie that it is lawfull generally: but when they come vnto vs, good zeale doth excuſe them, becauſe they thinke that nothing is vnlawfull, which may burthen vs or our cauſe.

               <p n="14">14 <hi>We haue heard.</hi> It ſhall full well appeare by Stephens defenſe, that hee neuer ſpake any thing touching Moſes or the Temple with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reuerence. And yet notwithſtanding this was not laide to his charge for nothing. For hee had taught the abrogating of the Lawe. But they are falſe witneſſes in this, and ſuborned to lie, becauſe they corrupt purpoſely thoſe thinges which were well and godlilie ſpoken. So Chriſt was enforced to cleare himſelfe, that hee came not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroie the Lawe, but to fulfill the Lawe, becauſe when hee had prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:7788:76" rendition="simple:additions"/> of abrogating the Ceremonies, the wicked wreſted this vnto an other purpoſe, as if he meant to aboliſh and take away the whole Lawe. Furthermore they wreſted that wickedlie vnto the Temple of Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, which hee ſpake of his bodie. What? was it not obiected to Paule that hee taught That euil is to bee done, that good may come thereof? Therefore there is no cauſe why wee ſhoulde woonder at this day that that is ſo falſely miſconſtrued which wee teach godlily, well and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tablie. Yea wee muſt rather perſwade our ſelues thus, that the doctrine of the Goſpel can neuer be handled ſo warilie and moderately, but that it ſhall be ſubiect to falſe accuſations. For Sathan, who is the father of lying, doeth alwayes beſtirre himſelfe in his office. Againe, becauſe there be manie thinges which are contrarie to the reaſon of the fleſh, men are enclined to nothing more, than to admit falſe reportes, which corrupt the true and ſyncere ſenſe of doctrine. This malice of Sathan, and the ſleights ought to make vs more warie, and more circumſpect, that no prepoſterous thing, or any thing that is vnproperly ſpoken e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape vs, wherewith they may be armed to fight againſt vs. For we muſt carefullie cut off from the wicked that occaſion whereat they ſnatch. And if wee ſee that doctrine which is by vs well and godlily deliuered, corrupted, deformed and torne in peeces with falſe reportes, wee muſt not repent that we haue begunne, neither yet is there any cauſe why we ſhoulde be more ſlacke hereafter. For it is not meete that wee ſhould be free from the poyſoned and venemous bytings of Sathan: which the ſon of God himſelfe coulde not eſcape. In the meane ſeaſon it is our parte and duetie to daſh and put away thoſe lies wherewith the truth of God is burdened: like as we ſee Chriſt free the doctrine of the Goſpel from vniuſt infamie. Onely let vs ſo prepare our ſelues that ſuch indignitie and vnhoneſt dealing may not hinder vs in our courſe. Becauſe wee teach that men are ſo corrupt, that they are altogither ſlaues vnto ſinne and wicked luſtes: the enimies doe thereuppon inferre this falſe accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, that wee denie that men ſinne willingly, but that they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced thereunto by ſome other meanes, ſo that they are not in the faulte, neither beare any blame: yea they ſay farther that we quench altogither all deſire to doe well. Becauſe wee denie that the workes of holy men are for their owne worthineſſe meritorious, becauſe they haue alwayes ſome faulte or imperfection in them, they cauill that wee put no difference betweene the good and the euill. Becauſe wee ſay that mans righteouſneſſe conſiſteth in the grace of God alone, and that godly ſoules can finde reſt no where elſe, ſaue onely in the death of Chriſt: they obiect that by this meanes wee graunt libertie to the fleſh to doe what ſo euer it will, that the vſe of the lawe may no longer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine. When as wee maintaine the honour of Chriſt, which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowe as it pleaſeth them heere and there, after that they haue rent it in a thouſande peeces like a pray, they feigne that wee are enimies to the Saintes.

Others alſo which take away all thinges as did the Academikes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that doth not pleaſe them which we teach, concerning the ſecret predeſtination of God, and that out of the ſcriptures lay to our charge diſpitefullie, that wee make God a tyraunt, which taketh pleaſure in putting innocent men to death, ſeeing that hee hath alreadie adiud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged thoſe vnto eternall death, which are as yet vnborne: and other ſuch thinges can bee ſaide on this behalfe:<note place="margin">2. Cor. 2.16.</note> whereas notwithſtanding they are ſufficientlie conuict that wee thinke reuerently of God, and that wee ſpeake no otherwiſe than hee teacheth with his owne mouth. It is an harde matter to endure ſuch enuie, yet muſt wee not therefore ceaſe of to defende a good cauſe. For the trueth of God is precious in his ſight, and it ought alſo to bee precious vnto vs: although it bee vnto the reprobate the ſauour of death vnto death. But nowe I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne vnto Stephen his accuſation, the principall pointe whereof is this, that hee blaſphemed God and Moſes. They doe for good conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations make the iniurie common to God and to Moſes: becauſe Moſes had nothing in his doctrine, which was his owne or ſeparated from God. They prooue this: becauſe hee ſpake blaſphemouſly againſt the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and the Lawe. Furthermore they make this the blaſphemie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee ſaide that the comming of Chriſt had made an ende of the Temple and the Ceremonies. It is not credible that Stephen ſpake thus as they report: but they maliciouſly wreſt thoſe thinges which were ſpoken well and godlily, that they may colour their falſe accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But although they had chaunged nothing in the wordes, yet Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen was ſo farre from doing anie iniurie to the Lawe and the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that hee coulde no way better and more truely praiſe the ſame. The Iewes did ſuppoſe that the Temple was quite diſhonoured, vnleſſe the ſhadowiſh eſtate thereof ſhoulde endure for euer: that the Lawe of Moſes was fruſtrate and nothing woorth, vnleſſe the Ceremonies ſhoulde bee continuallie in force. But the excellencie of the Temple and the profite of the Ceremonies conſiſt rather in this, whiles that they are referred vnto Chriſt, as vnto their principall patterne. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore howſoeuer the accuſation hath ſome colour, yet is it vniuſt and wicked. And although the fact come in queſtion, that is, whether the matter bee ſo as the aduerſaries lay to his charge, notwithſtanding the ſtate is properlie of qualitie. For they accuſe Stephen, becauſe hee taught that the forme of the worſhippe of God which was then vſed, ſhould bee chaunged: and they interprete this to bee blaſphemie againſt God and Moſes. Therefore the controuerſie is rather concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning right (as they ſay) than the fact it ſelfe. For the queſtion is, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be iniurious and wicked againſt God and Moſes, who ſaith that the viſible Temple is an image of a more excellent ſanctuarie, wherein dwelleth the fulneſſe of the Godhead, and who teacheth that the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes of the Law are temporall.</p>

                  <hi>This Ieſus of Nazareth.</hi> They ſpeake thus of Chriſt diſdainfully, as if the remembrance of him were deteſtable. Neuertheleſſe it may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered out of their accuſations, that Stephen did in the abrogating of the Lawe, ſet the bodie againſt the ſhadowes, and the ſubſtance againſt the figures. For if Ceremonies bee aboliſhed by Chriſt, their trueth is ſpirituall. The Iewes which woulde haue them continue for euer, did conſider nothing in them but that which was groſſe, carnall, earthlie, and which might be ſeene with the eies. Briefly, if the vſe of Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies were continual, they ſhould bee fraile and ſhoulde vaniſh away, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſhould haue nothing but the only external ſhew: ſo that they ſhoulde haue no ſoundnes. Therefore this is their true perpetuitie when as they are abrogated by the comming of Chriſt: becauſe it followeth here vpon, that the force and effect thereof doth conſiſt in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Shall chaunge the ordinances.</hi> It is out of all doubt that Stephen meant this of the ceremoniall part onely: but becauſe men are wont to be more addicted to externall pompe, theſe men vnderſtande that which was ſpoken, as if Stephen would bring the whole lawe to nothing. The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall precepts of the Lawe did in deede concerne the ſpirituall worſhip of God, faith, iuſtice, and iudgement: but becauſe theſe men make more account of the external rites, they call the rites which are commaunded concerning the ſacrifices, <hi>ordinances</hi> of Moſes, by excellencie. This was bredde by the bone from the beginning of the worlde, and it will neuer out of the fleſh ſo long as it laſteth. As at this day the Papiſtes acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge no worſhip of God ſaue onely in their viſures. Although they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer much from the Iewes, becauſe they follow nothing but the friuolous inuentions of men, for the ordinances of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And when they had beheld.</hi> Men doe commonly in places of iudgement turne their eies towarde the partie arreigned, when as they looke for his defenſe. Hee ſaieth that Stephen appeared like to an Angel. This is not ſpoken of his natural face, but rather of his preſent countenance. For whereas the countenance of thoſe which are areigned vſeth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly to be pale, whereas they ſtammer in their ſpeach, and ſhew other ſignes of feare, Luke teacheth that there was no ſuch thing in Stephen: but that there appeared rather in him a certaine maieſtie.

                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:7788:77"/>1 There appeareth as yet ſome colour of equitie in the higheſt prieſt and in the councell: and yet notwithſtanding there is a moſt vniuſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice in his wordes. For he asketh him not what cauſe he had to teach thus, neither doth he admit him vnto the defence of right (which was notwithſtanding the chief:) but he demandeth preciſely whether Stee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vttered theſe wordes whatſoeuer they were: as the Papiſtes at this day will not demaund what doctrine it is, and whether it can be proued out of the ſcriptures: but they enquire whether any man durſt mutter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their ſuperſtitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, that ſo ſoon as he is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uict, they may forthwith burne him. Furthermore, Steeuens anſwere may ſeeme at the firſt bluſh abſurd and fooliſh. He beginneth firſt at the very firſt beginning: after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward he maketh a long narration, wherein there is no mention made in a maner of the matter in hande. And there can be no greater fault than to vtter many wordes, which are nothing appertinent vnto the matter. But whoſoeuer ſhall throughly conſider this long ſpeech, hee ſhall finde nothing therein which is ſuperfluous: and ſhall full well perceiue that Steuen ſpeaketh very appertinently, as the matter requireth. He was ac<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cuſed as an Apoſtata or reuolt, which did attempt the ouerthrow of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and the worſhip of God. Therefore he beateth in this diligently, that he reteineth that God which the fathers haue alwayes worſhipped. So that he turneth away the crime of wicked backſliding: and declareth that his enemies were pricked forward with nothing leſſe than with the zeale of the law. For they bare a ſhew that they were wholy determined to encreaſe the glory of God. Therefore he wringeth from them this falſe boaſting. And becauſe they had the fathers alwaies in their mouths becauſe they were puft vp with the glorie of their nation: Steeuen de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth alſo, that they haue no cauſe to be proud of this: but rather, that the corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the fathers was ſo great &amp; ſo manie, that they ought to to be aſhamed and humbled. As concerning the principall ſtate of the cauſe, becauſe the queſtion was concerning the temple and the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, he affirmeth plainely that their fathers were elected of God to bee a peculiar people before there was any temple, and before Moſes was born. And to this end tendeth that <hi>exordium</hi> or beginning which is ſo far fet. Secondly he telleth them that all externall rites which God gaue by the hand of Moſes, were faſhioned according to the heauenly paterne. Whereupon it followeth, that the ceremoniall law is referred vnto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ende, and that thoſe deale fooliſhly and diſorderedly who omit the truth and ſtay only in the ſignes. If the readers ſhal referre the whole o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Steeuen vnto theſe pointes, they ſhall finde nothing therein which agreeth not very well with the cauſe: as I ſhal declare again brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the end. Neuertheles that ſcope of the whole oration ſhal not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but that we may diſcuſſe all things briefly, which are worth the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>Men, brethren, and fathers.</hi> Although Steeuen ſaw that thoſe which ſate in the councell were for the moſt part the ſworn enemies of Chriſt, yet becauſe the ordinarie gouernment of the people did belong to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and they had the ouerſight of the church, which God had not as yet caſt
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:7788:78"/> of, therefore hee is not afraide for modeſties ſake to call them fathers. Neither doth he flatteringly purchaſe fauour hereby. But he giueth this honour to the order and gouernment appointed by god, vntill ſuch time as the authoritie ſhuld be taken from them, the order being altered. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe the reuerence of the place which they had, doth not hinder him nor ſtoppe his mouth, but that hee doeth freely diſſent from them. Wherby it appeareth how ridiculous the papiſts are, who wil haue vs ſo tyed vnto bare &amp; vain inuented titles, that they may enforce vs to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe vnto their decrees though they be neuer ſo wicked.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The God of glory.</hi> By this beginning he declareth that hee doth not diſagree or diſſent from the fathers in true religion which they folowed. For all religion, the worſhippe of God, the doctrine of the lawe, all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies did depend vpon that couenant, which God made with Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Therefore when Steeuen confeſſed that God appeared to Abraham, he embraceth the law and the prophets, which flowe from that firſt reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as from a fountaine. Moreouer he calleth him the <hi>god of glory,</hi> that he may diſtinguiſhe him from the falſe and feigned Gods, who alone is worthie of glory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When he was in Meſopotamia,</hi> It is well knowen that that region is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by this name, which lyeth betweene the riuer <hi>Tygris</hi> and <hi>Euphrates.</hi> And he ſaith before, he dwelt in Charran: becauſe Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being warned by an oracle, fledde from Chaldea to Charran, which is a Citie of Meſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potamia, famous by reaſon of the ſlaughter of Craſſus and the Romane armie: althogh Plinie ſaith that it was a citie of Arabia. And it is no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell that Chaldea is in this place comprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded vnder the name of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopotamia: becauſe although that region which is encloſed with <hi>Tygris</hi> and <hi>Euphrates,</hi> be properly<note n="“" place="margin">Or <hi>Meſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potamia.</hi>
                  </note> the countrie between two riuers. Yet thoſe which ſet down any deſcriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of countries, do cal both Aſſyria &amp; Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea by this name. The ſumme is this, that Abraham being commanded by God, did forſake his countrie: and ſo he was preuented with the meer goodnes of god, when as he ſought that which was offered him at home of the owne accord. Read the laſt chapter of Ioſua. But it ſeemeth that Moſes his narration doth ſomewhat diſagree with this. For after that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the end of the 11. chap. of Geneſis he had declared, that Abraham doth goe into another countrie to dwel, hauing left his houſe, he addeth in the beginning of the twelf, that god ſpake vnto Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. This is eaſily anſwered. For Moſes reciteth not in this latter place what hapned after the departure of Abraham: but leaſt any man ſhould thinke that Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham wandered into other countries hauing vnaduiſedly forſaken his owne houſe (as light and vndiſcrete men vſe to doe ſometimes) hee ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth the cauſe of his departure, to wit, becauſe he was commaunded by God to flit into another place. And thus much do the words of the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle import. For if hee had beene a ſtraunger in an other countrie, God could not haue commaunded him to depart out of his natiue ſoyle, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking his kinſmen and fathers houſe. Therefore wee ſee that this place agreeth wondrous well with the wordes of Moſes. For after that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes hath ſaide that Abraham went to Charran to the end he may ſhewe that this iourney was taken in hande not through any lightnes of man,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:7788:78" rendition="simple:additions"/> but at the commaundement of god, he addeth that afterward, which he had before omitted, which maner of ſpeaking is much vſed of the Hebr.</p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>Come out of thy countrie.</hi> God vſeth many wordes, to the end hee may the more wound the mind of Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as if it were not a thing ſharpe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of it ſelf to be baniſhed out of his own countrie. And that ſerued to trie his faith: euen as that other thing alſo, that god aſſigneth him no land wherin he may dwel, but maketh him ſtande in doubt &amp; waite for a time. Wherfore the obedience of Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was ſo much the more to bee commended, becauſe the ſweetnes of his natiue ſoyle keepeth him not back fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> going willingly as it were into exile: &amp; in that hee doubteth not to folow God, althogh there appear no certain reſting place, but is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to wander to &amp; fro for a time. Whereas the ſhewing of the land is deferred, it differeth not much fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deceiuing of him Furthermore we learne continually by our owne experience, how profitable it was for A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham thus to be exerciſed &amp; as it were trained by little &amp; little. Manie men are carried with a godly affection to attempt great things. but by &amp; by ſo ſoone as their heat is waxen cold, it repenteth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their purpoſe, &amp; they would gladly ſlip their necks out of the coller. Therfore leaſt A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham ſhuld faint when he was in the midſt of his courſe, through the reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance of thoſe things which he had left behind him, god ſitteth &amp; trieth his mind throughly, immediatly after he had begun, leaſt he take any thing in hand lightly, &amp; vnaduiſedly. To this purpoſe ſerueth the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,<note place="margin">Luk. 14.28.</note> which Chriſt ſetteth before vs concerning the building of the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer. For he techeth that we muſt firſt caſt the charges, leaſt with ſhame we be enforced to leaue off building after we haue begun. And though this were a particular thing in Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in that he was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded to goe out of his own countrie, &amp; to go into a far countrie: in that God carried him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> place to place, yet notwithſtanding there is in theſe words ſome figure of the calling of vs all. We are not al ſimply co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded to forſake our countrie, but we are commanded to denie our ſelues: we are not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to come out of our fathers houſe, but to bid a due to our owne will, &amp; to the deſires of our own fleſh. Againe, if father and mother, wife &amp; children hinder vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> following God, we muſt forſake them all. The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement is giuen ſimply to Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to flit: but we are commanded to doe the ſame vpon condition. For if in any place we cannot ſerue god, we muſt rather make choiſe of exile, than to ſtay in our neſt being ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful &amp; ſluggiſh. Therefore let vs haue the example of Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alwayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our eyes. He is the father of the faithfull, he was tried all manner of wayes: doth he forget his countrie, his friends, and himſelf, that he may giue ouer himſelf vnto God? If we will be counted the children of God,<note place="margin">Ro. 4.16.17.</note> we muſt not degenerate from him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Which I ſhall ſhew thee.</hi> We muſt note that which I touched a little before, that Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is kept in dout, to the end his patience may be tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And this muſt we alſo apply to our own vſe, that we may learn to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend wholy vpon god. And ſurely this is a principal exerciſe of our fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>th, to put our truſt in God, euen when we ſee nothing. God in deed will of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes ſhewe vs a lande wherein hee graunteth vs an abiding place:
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:7788:79"/> yet notwithſtanding becauſe we are ſtrangers in the world, wee haue no certaine and continuall place of aboade any where. Again, our life, as Paule ſaith,<note place="margin">Coloſ. 3.3.</note> is hidde: and being like vnto dead men, wee hope for ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which is hid in heauen. Therfore as touching our perpetuall habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, God doth cauſe vs to depend vpon his prouidence alone when be commaundeth vs as it were to wander in a ſtrange countrie. Leaſt ſuche deferring diſcourage vs, wee muſt holde this general rule of faith: that we muſt go whither god calleth vs, howſoeuer he do not ſhew that which he promiſeth.</p>
               <p n="4">4 <hi>Then going out.</hi> The readineſſe and willingneſſe of faith is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended in theſe wordes. For when he is called, he maketh no delay, but maketh haſt and ſubdueth all his affections, that they may obey the holy commaundement of God. It is vncertaine for what cauſe hee ſtaied at Charran: yet it may be that the weaknes of his father cauſed him to tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie there, who as we read, died there ſhortly after: or els becauſe he durſt goe no further vntill ſuch time as the Lord hadde told him whither hee ſhould goe. It is more like to be true in mine opinion, that he was ſtaied there a while with the weariſomneſſe and ſickneſſe of his father, becauſe Steeuen ſaith plainly, that he was brought thence after the death of his father.</p>
               <q>
                  <p n="5">
                     <hi>5</hi> And he gaue him none inheritance in it, no not the breadth of a foot: and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed that he would giue it him to poſſeſſe, and to his ſeed after him, when as he had no ſonne.</p>
                  <p n="6">
                     <hi>6</hi> And God ſpake after this manner: Thy ſeed ſhall ſoiourne in a strange land, and they ſhall bring it into bondage: and ſhall euill intreat it fortie yeres.</p>
                  <p n="7">
                     <hi>7</hi> But the nation whom they ſhall ſerue, will I iudge, ſaid God. And afterwarde they ſhall come out and ſhal worſhip me in this place.</p>

               </q>
               <p n="5">5 Wee muſt note three things in this place: that GOD exerciſed the patience of his ſeruant, becauſe after that hee had brought him out of his owne countrie, he dwelt in the land of Chanaan as a ſtranger. For Abraham poſſeſſed not one footes breadth, ſaue onely that which hee bought to burie in. And that is counted no poſſeſſion which ſerueth not for the vſes of this life. Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly foraſmuch as that field was bought, Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen doth for good cauſes ſay, that God gaue Abraham nothing. For that could not be gotten either with money, or by any other meanes which man could inuent, which Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did hope for of the promiſe. Secondlie we muſt note, that though God did not ſhew Abraham the thing it ſelfe as yet, yet did he vpholde him by his worde. And this is our ſtay, when God promiſeth that that is laid vp for vs, which as yet wee poſſeſſe not. Therefore when as the thing, that is the poſſeſſion of the land was wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, Abraham had for his help and ſtay the promiſe of God: and being content with the ſame alone, hee deſired nothing in the land of Chana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:7788:79"/> ſaue only an vncerteine reſting place wherin he might ſoiourne. For as much as <hi>epaggellesthai</hi> ſignifieth ſimplie to promiſe. I thought there was no cauſe, why with Eraſmus I ſhould tranſlate it in this place, to <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe againe.</hi> For I reſolue it aduerſatiuely. Althogh he had promiſed, that by the way we may note as it were a ſhew of deceiuing, vnleſſe peradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſome man be diſpoſed to apply it vnto the promiſes which are ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times repeated. Thirdly we muſt note that the promiſe was ſuch that it did not much differ from a meere mocke. God promiſed the land to the ſeed of Abraham when he was foureſcore yeres old, and had to wife one that was barre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, neither had he any hope to haue any iſſue. This ſeemeth to be more tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> friuolous. For why doeth he not rather promiſe that hee will giue him ſeed? but this was a notable trial of faith, in that Abraham without asking any queſtion, or any curious diſputation, did obediently and meekly imbrace that which he had hard proceed out of the mouth of the Lord. Therefore let vs remember that God doeth ſo lift vppe and comfort his ſeruant with his worde, that he doth not onely deferre the giuing of the thing, but alſo he may ſeeme after a ſort to mock him:<note place="margin">Iam. 2.5.</note> as he dealeth with vs alſo in ſome reſpect. For although he cal vs the heires of the worlde, hee ſuffereth vs oftentimes to want euen a competent li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and neceſſarie helpes. And this doth he of ſet purpoſe, that he may bring the wiſdome of the fleſh to nought, ſeeing that we doe not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe giue due honour to his word.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thy ſeed ſhalbe a ſtranger.</hi> Steuen putteth the Iewes in mind in how mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable and reprochfull an eſtate their fathers were in Egipt: and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that this their ſeruitude, wherwith they were oppreſſed came not by chaunce: becauſe it was fortolde long before by the oracle of God. This hiſtorie ought to haue bin of great force, partly to tame their loftie cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages, and to teach them modeſtie, partly to ſet foorth the grace of God: becauſe God had alwayes had a care of that nation. For this is a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar benefite in that the people are reſtored wonderfully as it were from death to life. In the meane ſeaſon the Iewes are taught that the church of God was elswhere, than in the land wherein they dwelt: that the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were choſen to be a peculiar people, and that they were kept ſafe vnder the tuition of God, before euer the temple was built: or the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ceremonies of the law were inſtituted. Theſe things appertain vnto the generall ſcope or drift of the ſermon. But hence may wee gather a profitable admonition. Bondage is of it ſelfe hard and bitter: but when crueltie of maſters is added thereunto, it ſeemeth to be intollerable. Wherefore it muſt needes be that the minde of the godly man was ſore wounded, when he heard that his ſeed ſhould ſerue and bee villanouſlie and cruelly intreated. Moreouer this was no ſmall tryall: forasmuch as theſe thinges were, to looke to, contrarie, the enheritance of the lande of Chanaan which was nowe promiſed, and bondage in a ſtrange coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie. For who woulde not haue thought, that god had as it were forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten his former promiſe, when as he telleth Abraham that his ſeede ſhall endure miſerable bondage? He ſaith at the firſt that he wil giue his ſeed the lande. But he had as yet no ſeed: yea all hope of ſeed was nowe cut
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:7788:80" rendition="simple:additions"/> off. But when doth he promiſe that he will giue it? After his death. By &amp; by he ſaith, that that ſeed ſhould be carried away to another place, that it may ſerue ſtrangers. And how long? Foure hundred yeeres. Doth hee not ſeeme by this meanes to pul back his hand, that he may not perform that which he had promiſed? Let vs know that this was done (not once only) for god dealeth oftentimes with vs thus, ſo that he may ſeem con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to himſelfe: and he ſpeaketh alſo in ſuch ſort as that he may ſeem to call back that which he had promiſed. Therfore it cannot be but that fleſh will iudge that he is contrarie to himſelfe, but faith doth know that his words do agree wel together amongſt themſelues, &amp; with his works. And this is the purpoſe of God, to the end hee may extende the ſight of our faith the farther, to ſhew his promiſes a far of, as it were a long place being put between. Therefore it is our dutie to goe toward &amp; to ſtiue to attaine vnto that ſaluation which is ſet before vs through many ſtraits, through diuers lets, through long diſtance, through the midſt of deeps, and finally, through death it ſelfe. Furthermore ſeeing that wee ſee that the people which God had choſen, did ſerue the Egyptians, and was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courteouſly afflicted, we muſt not bee diſcouraged, if the like condition be prepared for vs at this day. For it is no new thing, neither any vnwo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thing, for the church of God to lie oppreſſed vnder tyrannie, and to be as it were troden vnder foot of the wicked.</p>
               <p n="7">7 <hi>The nation whom they ſhall ſerue.</hi> This iudgement is ioyned with the deliuerance of the people. For whereas God doth puniſh the cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and tyrannie of the wicked Egyptians, he doeth that for his peoples ſake, whom he tooke into his tuition, that it may be ſeene that he is the deliuerer of his church. Therefore ſo often as wee are vniuſtly afflicted by the wicked, let vs remember that God is the iudge of the world, who wil let no iniuries be vnpuniſhed: let euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thus think with himſelf, Seing that I am vnder the tuition of God, who is the iudge of the world, and to whom it belongeth to puniſh all iniuries:<note place="margin">Deu. 32.43. Rom. 12.19</note> thoſe ſhall not eſcape his hand who trouble me now. There is the like place in Deut. 32. Where god ſaith, that vengea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is his. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce Paul gathereth that we muſt giue place to wrath: as if he ſhould ſay, that this ought to ſerue to reform im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience, &amp; to bridle our euil affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, in that god promiſeth that he wil reuenge. For he which reuengeth himſelfe, doth take Gods office from him. And let vs ſtill remember that which I haue alreadie ſaid, that God is touched with an eſpecial care to reuenge iniuries done to his childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as it is in the Pſalme, Hurt not mine annointed, and be not trouble ſome to my prophetes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They ſhall come thence and ſerue me.</hi> Therfore their deliuerance went before the temple, &amp; the worſhip of the law. Wherupon it foloweth, that the grace of God was not tyed to ceremonies. Neuertheleſſe Steeuen noteth the end of their deliuerance, that god choſe both a peculiar peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, &amp; a peculiar place for the true worſhip of his name. Whence we ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther again, that we muſt regard what he commandeth &amp; alloweth. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nations alſo were determined to worſhip God, but becauſe their rites were corrupt and baſtardly, God doth ſeparate the Iewes from the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:7788:80"/> reſt, and aſſigneth them a place, where he wil haue them to worſhip him ſincerely &amp; duly as they ought. This place teacheth vs, that Gods bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites muſt be referred to this end, that men might be brought to addict &amp; giue ouer themſelues wholy to him. Now ſince that god hath diſpear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the treaſures of his grace throughout the whole world: wee muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuor to ſanctifie him, by worſhipping him purely and holily, in what countrie ſoeuer we dwel.</p>
               <p n="8">8 <hi>He gaue him the couenant.</hi> When as he confeſſeth that circumciſion is the couenant of God, hee cleereth himſelfe ſufficiently of that crime which was laid to his charge: but in the mean ſeaſon he ſheweth that the Iewes deale amiſſe, if they place the beginning of their ſaluation in the externall ſigne. For if Abraham was called, &amp; the lande, &amp; redemption promiſed to his ſeed before ſuch time as hee was circumciſed, it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that the glory of the whole ſtock doth not depend vpon circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Paul vſeth the ſame argument in the 4. chap. to the Romans. For ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Abraham obtained righteouſnes &amp; pleaſed God before he was circumciſed,<note place="margin">Rom. 4.11.</note> hee gathereth thence that circumciſion is not the cauſe of righteouſnes. Therefore we ſee that Steeuen frameth no vain and idle narration: becauſe this was very much appertinent vnto the cauſe, that the Iewes might remember how God had adopted them with their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. &amp; it is to be thought that Steuen did plainly expreſſe both things: that althogh circumciſion was giuen by God, that it might be a ſigne of grace, yet was the adoptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before it, both in order &amp; in time. But we haue no neede to diſpute any longer in this place concerning the nature and force of circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, only let vs note this, that god doth firſt promiſe thoſe things to Abraham which he confirmeth afterward by circumciſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: that we may knowe that the ſignes are vain &amp; nothing worth, vnles the word go before. Let vs alſo note that there is a profitable doctrine contained in the word <hi>couenant:</hi> to wit, that god maketh his couenant with vs in the Sacraments, that he may declare his loue toward vs: which thing if it be true, firſt they are not only workes of externall profeſſion amongſt men: but they gaue great force inwardly before god to confirme the faith. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly they are no vaine figures: becauſe God who is true, figureth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing there which he doth not perfourme.</p>

Neither coulde the Iewes obiect that it was a priuate fault of a few: for the infamie reacheth vnto all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. For as much as all the patriarkes, Beniamin except, had polluted themſelues with that treacherie.

For beſides that ſlauerie was a kinde of death, we know what they went about at the firſt, &amp; ſecondly what cruel puniſhments Ioſeph ſuffred of al which his brethren were giltie. Hereby it appeareth that God was bountiful and mercifull to thoſe, which were as it were vnwilling, &amp; which did reſiſt him. For him (who was about to be the authour of health &amp; help) would they haue deſtroyed. Wherfore they did what they could to renounce all the benefites of God. So he wil declare afterward that Moſes was reiected, when he was offered of God to be a redeemer. Therfore the Iewes haue ſmal cauſe to brag of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie of their kinred: but this alone remaineth for them, that beeing aſhamed, they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe that whoſoeuer they are they haue the ſame tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the meere mercie of God, and that they conſider that the lawe was giuen to ſet foorth the ſame.</p>

                  <hi>God was with him.</hi> God was not ſo with him, that hee did alwaies ſhewe forth his power in helping him. For that is no ſmal thing which is ſaide in the Pſalm, That the yron went through his ſoule. Surely it muſt needs be that he was in great heauines,<note place="margin">Pſal. 105.18</note> when being deſtitute of all help, he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered reproch alſo together with bands &amp; the puniſhment of an vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and wicked man: but God vſeth oftentimes to bee preſent with his in ſuch ſort, that he lyeth hid for a time. And the end was an euident toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his preſence, which Ioſeph ſaw not at the firſt. Furthermore we ought to reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber this euer now &amp; then, that Ioſeph was not deliuered becauſe he had called vpon God in the temple, but a farre of in Egypt.</p>
               <p n="10">10 Steeuen addeth the meanes, becauſe God gaue him fauour in the ſight of Pharao. God could haue deliuered him by ſome other meanes, but his counſel had reſpect vnto a farther thing, that Ioſeph being ruler of the kingdom, might entertain his father &amp; al his familie. In theſe two wordes <hi>fauour &amp; wiſdome,</hi> there is the figure Hipallage. For the wiſdome wherewith Ioſeph was endued, was the cauſe that he founde fauour. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I confeſſe that they were two diſtinct benefites. For though Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph were a faithful interpreter of dreames, and did excell in diuine wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, yet the proud tyrant woulde neuer haue brought him to ſo great honour, vnleſſe God had bent the minde of Pharao vnto a certaine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wonted loue: yet notwithſtanding we muſt conſider that order, whereby God vſeth to bring him into fauour. <hi>Wiſdome</hi> doeth not only ſignifie the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:7788:81"/> gift of propheſie in interpreting dreames, but prudence in giuing coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell: for Moſes putteth in both. That which Steeuen reporteth of one man in this place, is extended vnto all. For what aptnes and readineſſe ſoeuer is in men, it ought to be reckoned amongſt the giftes of God, and that his ſpeciall giftes. And it is he that giueth good ſucceſſe as it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him, that his gifts may be profitable to that end for which it ſemed good to him to giue them. Therefore although Ioſeph bee made chiefe ruler of Egypt by Pharao, yet is he lifted vp to ſo great honour properly by the hand of God.</p>
               <p n="11">11 <hi>There came a famine.</hi> Hereby it appeareth that the deliuerance of Ioſeph was ſuch a benefite as was common to al the familie of Iacob. For ſeeing the famin drew on, Ioſeph was ſent before in due time, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide ſuſtenance to feed the hungrie: as he himſelfe doth acknowledge the wonderfull counſell of God in that point. Neuertheleſſe the free goodneſſe of God appeareth plainly in the perſon of Ioſeph, whiles that he is appointed to nouriſh and feed his brethren, who had ſold him, and by that meanes ſent him far away, and thought that hee was gone away quite out of the world: he putteth meat in their mouthes, who had thro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen him into a pit, and had depriued him of the aire and the common breath. Finally, hee nouriſheth &amp; preſerueth their life, who were not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to take from him his life. In the mean ſeaſon Steeuen putteth the Iewes in mind of this, that the patriarks were enforced to depart out of that land, which was giuen them for an heritage, and that they died in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother place. Therfore foraſmuch as they were ſoiourners in it, they are at length baniſhed out of the ſame.</p>
               <p n="14">14 Whereas he ſaith that Iacob came into Egypt with ſeuentie fiue ſoules, it agreeth not with the words of Moſes. For Moſes maketh men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſeuentie only. Hierome thinketh that Luke ſetteth not downe word for word thoſe things which Steeuen had ſpoken, or that he tooke this number out of the Greek tranſlation of Moſes: either becauſe hee himſelf being a Proſylite had not the knowledge of the Hebrew tongue:<note place="margin">Gen-46.27</note> or becauſe he would graunt the Gentiles this, who vſed to read it thus. Furthermore it is vncertaine whether the Greek interpreters ſet down this nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of ſet purpoſe, or whether it crope in afterward through neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence. Which (I mean the latter) might well be, foraſmuch as the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians vſe to ſet down their numbers in letters. Auguſt in his 26. book of citie of God, thinketh that Ioſephs nephewes &amp; kinſmen are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in this number: &amp; ſo he thinketh that the word <hi>went down,</hi> doth ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie all that time which Iacob liued. But that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iecture can by no means be receiued. For in the meane ſpace the other patriarkes alſo had many children born to them. This ſeemeth to mee a thing like to be true, that the ſeuentie interpreters did tranſlate that truly which was in Moſes. And we cannot ſay that they were deceiued: foraſmuch as Deu. 10. wher this nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber is repeated, they agree with Moſes, at leaſt as that place was read without all dout in the time of Hierome. For thoſe coppies which are printed at this day, haue it otherwiſe. Therfore I think that this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference came through the errour of the writers whiche wrote out the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:7788:82"/> bookes. And it was a matter of no ſuche weight, for which Luke ought to haue troubled the Gentiles which were accuſtomed with the Greek reading. And it may be that he himſelf did put down the true number: &amp; that ſome man did correct the ſame amiſſe out of that place of Moſes. For we know that thoſe which had the new teſtament in hand, were ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the Hebrew tongue, yet skilfull in the Greek. Therefor to the end e the wordes of Steeuen might agree with the place of Moſes, it is to be thought that that falſe number which was found in the Greeke tranſlation of Geneſis was by them put in alſo in this place: concerning which if any man contend more ſtubbornly, let vs ſuffer him to bee wiſe without meaſure. Let vs reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber that it is not without cauſe that Paule doth forbid vs to be too curious about genealogies. This ſo ſmal a nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber is purpoſely expreſſed, to the end the power of god may the more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie appear, in ſo great an enlarging of that kinred, which was of no long continua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. For ſuch a ſmall handfull of men could not by any humane maner of engendring grow to ſuch an infinit multitude as is recorded in Exodus, within 250. yeres. We ought rather to weigh the myracle which the Spirit co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth vnto vs in this place,<note place="margin">Exo. 12.37.</note> than to ſtand long about one letter, wherby the number is altered. There ariſe other queſtions, (and thoſe which are more hard to be anſwered) out of the reſt of the text.</p>
               <p n="16">16 Steeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſaith, that the Patriarks were carried into the land of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,<note place="margin">Gen. 50.13.

And Ioſua 24. it is reported, that the bones of Ioſeph were buried without making any mention of the reſt.

And ſurely when Ierome in the pilgrimage of <hi>Paula,</hi> ſaith, that ſhe came by Sichem, he ſaith that ſhe ſaw there the ſepulchres of the 12.

I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> affirme nothing concerning this matter for a certaintie, ſaue onely that this is either a ſpeech wherein is Synecdoche: or els that Luke rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth this not ſo much out of Moſes, as according to the old fame: as the Iewes had many things in times paſt from the fathers, which were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered as it were from hand to hand. And whereas hee ſaith afterwarde they were laid in the ſepulchre which Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had bought of the ſons of Hemor,<note place="margin">Gen. 23.9.</note> it is manifeſt that there is a fault in the worde <hi>Abraham.</hi> For A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had bought a double caue of Ephron the Hitite to burie his wife Sara in: but Ioſeph was buried in another place: to wit, in the field which his father Iacob hadde bought of the ſonnes of Hemor, for an hundred lambes.

And when as they are commanded to caſt out their male infants, it ſeemeth that the deſtruction of the whole na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was preſent. There is another token of deliueraunce giuen, when Moſes commeth abroad: but becauſe he is by &amp; by refuſed and enforced to flie into exile, there remaineth nothing but meer diſpair. The ſumme is this, that God being mindefull of his promiſe, did increaſe the people in time, that he might perform that which he had ſworne to Abraham: but the Iewes (as they were vnthankful &amp; froward) did refuſe the grace of god, ſo that they did what they could to ſhut vp the way before them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. Furthermore we muſt note the prouidence of God in this place, whiles that he doth ſo order the courſe of times, that his works haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies their opportunitie. But men who make haſt diſorderedly in their deſires, cannot hope patiently &amp; be at reſt vntill ſuch time as god ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth his hand: for this cauſe, becauſe they take no heed to that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration wherof I haue ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And to the end god may exerciſe the faith of his children, ſo often as he appeareth with ioyfull tokens of grace, hee ſetteth other things againſt thoſe on the other ſide, which cut off ſodain<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly the hope of ſaluation. For who would not haue ſaid of the Hebrewes, that they wer vtterly vndone, when as the kings co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth al the men children to be put to death?

               <p n="20">20 It is not without cauſe that Steeuen noteth the circumſtance of time. Moſes was born at the very ſame time when the king had comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that all the men children ſhould bee caſt out. Therefore it ſeemeth that the miniſter of deliuera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is dead before he is borne. But that time is moſt fit for God to worke in,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 12.9.</note> when there is no hope or counſell to bee looked for at mans hands. And it appeareth alſo moſt plainly, how God doth make perfect his power in mans weaknes. Moſes is kept three mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths, but at length his parents (that they may ſaue their own liues) are inforced to caſt him out into the riuer. Only they put him in a little co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, that he may not by &amp; by periſh. When as Pharaoes daughter taketh him vp, he eſcaped death in deed, yet ſo that he goeth into another na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being cut off from the kinred of Iſrael. Yea he was like to bee a moſt troubleſome aduerſarie to his nation, vnleſſe God had reſtrained his mind. It is 40. yeres before he ſheweth any token of brotherly goodwill.</p>
               <p n="22">22 Whereas Luke reporteth that he was taught in <hi>all wiſdome</hi> of the Egyptians, hee putteth that in his commendation as a point of excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie. Notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding it might haue ſo falne out, as it doth oftentimes, that beeing puft vp with profane ſciences, hee might haue deſpiſed the baſe commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> people: yet becauſe god hath determined to redeem his people,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:7788:83"/> he doth in the meane ſeaſon frame both the minde of Moſes &amp; al other things to finiſh his worke. The reaſon of mans fleſhe ſhould murmur in this place, Why doth God winke at ſo long miſeries of the people? Why doteh hee ſuffer Pharao to rage more cruelly daily? Why doeth he not ſuffer Moſes to growe vp amongeſt his owne people? Why doth hee af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a ſort cut him off fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the kinred of Iſrael, being adopted by the kings daughter? Why will he ſuffer him to remaine amidſt courtly pleaſures, and doth not rather pull him thence? But the end it ſelfe is ſo wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, that we are enforced to confeſſe, that all theſe thinges were gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by ſingular counſel and order, to ſet forth the glorie of God. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as I ſaid that Luke ſpeaketh in this place of the learning of the Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans for honours ſake, I would not haue it ſo taken, as if there were in the ſame no corruption. Foraſmuch as Aſtrologie doth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful workema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſhip of God, not only in the placing of the ſtarres, &amp; in ſuch excellent varietie, but alſo in their mouing, force, and ſecrete offices, it is a ſcience both profitable &amp; worthie of praiſe. The Egyptians beſtowed great ſtudie in this: but being not content with the ſimple order of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, they wandered alſo in manie fooliſhe ſpeculations, as did the Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans. It is vncertaine whether Moſes were infected with theſe ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions or no. Yet howſoeuer it be, we ſee how ſincerely, &amp; plainly he ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth that before vs to be conſidered in the frame of the world, which is appertinent vnto godlines. Surely this was excellent modeſty in that he which could reaſon with learned and wittie men of the ſecretes of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, doth not only omit higher ſubtilties, but doeth alſo diſcende vnto the common capacitie of euerie moſt ſimple man, and doeth in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſtyle ſet foorth vnto men vnlearned, thoſe thinges which they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue by experience. When Iuſtine bableth concerning Moſes, hee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth him a Magician, which with iugling and inchauntments made paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage for the people through the redde ſea. So that Satan did not only go about to burie the power of God, but alſo to blaſpheme the ſame. But we know that Moſes did not ſtriue with the enchaunters by Magike, but did that only which God had enioined him. Furthermore the Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans had myſticall diuinitie, wherewith they coloured their doting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions, and monſtrous abhominations, as if they wold proue that they went mad not without reaſon: as the Papiſts, whereas they delude and mocke men like ſtage players; in their maſſe and other fooliſh rites, yet they inuent myſteries, that they may perſwade me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that there is nothing there but that which is diuine. The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon ſort of Prieſts cannot climb ſo high: but thoſe which amongſt them wil be accounted more cunning, doe omit no rite, how fooliſhe and childiſh ſoeuer it bee, affirming that there is ſome ſpirituall myſterie in euerie of them. There is extant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this matter a moſt fooliſh mingle mangle, which they call the Rationall of diuine offices. But foraſmuch as Sacrificing Prieſts alone did vſe ſuch dotings amongeſt themſelues, it is not to bee thought that Moſes ſpent any time in theſe, whoſe bringing vp was princely: But that hee was taught in liberall artes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hee was mightie.</hi> This phraſe doth expreſſe amongſt the Hebrewes,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:7788:84"/> a double excellencie, when as he which doth excell in wit and learning, is alſo apt to attempt &amp; bring to paſſe great and weightie matters. Stee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen his meaning is therefore, that Moſes was furniſhed with rare giftes, ſo that they did all confeſſe that he was a ſingular man. But ſeing he was in ſuch eſtimation, the Iſraelits had the leſſe hope that he ſhould be the miniſter which ſhould work their deliuerance.</p>
               <p n="23">23 <hi>When the time was fulfilled.</hi> Many gather by this that Moſes was neuer eſtranged in mind fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his nation: but the words of Steuen incline rather toward the contrarie: to wit, that the Spirit of God did at length awake his mind as it were out of ſleep, that he might at length goe viſite his brethren, whom he had long time neglected. It is to be thought that hee was not ignorant of what ſtocke he came, ſeeing he had ſome token thereof in his fleſh, and ſeeing the rumor thereof was ſpread abroade in the court: becauſe the kinges daughter could not adopt him to bee her ſonne, without ſome ſuſpition of wickedneſſe, vnleſſe his kinred had byn knowen: yet was it long before he was of ſuch courage that hee durſt make knowen the loue which he bare toward his kinred. And this ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth not a little to ſet foorth the glory of God, that Moſes being igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of his calling, doth remaine a long time idle in the kings court: and is afterward called of the Lord contrary to the hope of all men and his owne alſo. Therefore this new care for his brethren, which came into his minde, proceeded from a newe and vnwonted motion of Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite.</p>
               <p n="24">24 <hi>When he ſaw a certaine man.</hi> Moſes came not to this ſpectacle by chaunce, but foraſmuch as God had appointed him to be the deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of his people, he would haue him ſhew foorth this token, &amp; as it were make this beginning. For Steeuen doth plainly expreſſe, that he did at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt nothing vnaduiſedly: but did that which became him, that was appointed to bee a deliuerer of the people, knowing that hee was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto called. For vnleſſe God had armed him and made him puiſſaunt, it had been a thing altogether vnlawfull for him to kill any man, how wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ſoeuer he had bin. It is a godly deed &amp; praiſe worthy, for a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſet himſelfe againſt the wicked, to defend the good againſt the iniuries of the wicked, to bridle their violence: but it is not for a priuate perſon to puniſh or take vengea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. Therfore it was vnlawfull for Moſes to ſlea the Egyptia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſaue only in as much as the Lord had put the ſword in his hand according to the right of his calling. But this heroicall courage and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe of heart was a work of the holy ghoſt: becauſe God doth migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily ſhew foorth his power in thoſe who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he appointeth vnto great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that they may be able to fulfill their function. In ſumme, Steeuen meaneth that Moſes was euen then offered to be the miniſter of deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, when the day was at hand according to the couenant made with Abraham: yet did the people hope for nothing leſſe.</p>
               <p n="26">26 <hi>The day following hee appeared</hi> Steeuen declareth nowe that the fathers did not only neglect, but maliciouſly reiect the grace of god. For although the euill which he mentioneth did proceed from one man on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, yet doeth hee by right aſſigne the fault vnto them al. For if they had
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:7788:84" rendition="simple:additions"/> been thankfull to God, they woulde all with one conſent haue repreſſed his frowardnes. But they are whiſht, &amp; ſuffer that good turn which Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes had done, to be vpbraided vnto him: and ſo much as in them lyeth, they bring him into extreeme danger, whom they ought to haue defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by endangering themſelues. Therfore his drift is this, that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple themſelues were in the fault, that they were no ſooner deliuered and eaſed. So the wickedneſſe of men doth oftentimes hinder God from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he would do. He is ready to helpe thoſe that be his in due time, but we keepe back his hand from our ſelues with diuers lettes: and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward we complaine of his ſlownes, but vniuſtly. Furthermore this vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulneſſe was too wicked againſt God, &amp; too cruell againſt Moſes. They were to thanke God, for giuing them ſuch a faithful patron in the kings court. They were to loue and reuerence Moſes. But they rewarded him full euil with threatnings &amp; reproches. Furthermore, in aſmuch as the fact was brought to the kinges eares, we muſt needs impute that to the treacherie of the people. Therefore as when afterwarde the people could ſee the lande of Chanaan, they did through their own follie keepe themſelues fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> entring in: ſo nowe refuſing the grace of God in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of one man, they cauſe the time of their deliueraunce to be deferred fortie yeeres. For although God had determined what he would do, yet thoſe are iuſtly blamed for the delay, which hinder Moſes in his office.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Men, ye are brethren.</hi> There is indeed amongſt men a generall coniun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, ſo that they ought to vſe great courteſie one toward another, &amp; to abſtain from al iniuries: but this is more vnmeet, and vntollerable when thoſe hurt one another, who are neerer linked together. Therefore Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes doth not onely vſe a generall reaſon, that it may reuoke thir mindes which were deſirous to do harme: but he mentioneth their kinred &amp; fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip of blood to mollifie their crueltie: yet all in vaine: for hee which had done iniurie to his neighbour, doth frowardly thruſt him from him, &amp; addeth thereunto threatning. And this is a common thing amongeſt men. For an euill conſcience doth driue men into furie, &amp; the worſe eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie mans cauſe is, the more boldly &amp; cruelly doth he extoll himſelfe. But vnder what colour doth hee which hath the worſe cauſe ſet himſelfe ſo ſtubbornly againſt Moſes? He ſaith, he is no iudge but he did not reproue them according to authoritie: but did only friendly admoniſhe them. Is it the duetie of a iudge alone to admoniſh vs when wee doe amiſſe? But this is a common vice vſed of al ſtubborn &amp; vnruly perſons, to giue place to no admonitions, ſaue only when they are enforced by violence &amp; au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie: yea they are like frantike men who raile vppon their phiſitions. For which cauſe we muſt be the more carefull to bridle our luſts: leaſt we runne headlong with ſuch blinde furie againſt thoſe which are deſirous to cure our vices. Furthermore wee are taught by this example, that the ſeruants of God cannot ſo doe their duetie in reprouing ſuche vices of men, but they ſhal ſuffer many iniuries, offend many, &amp; incurre dangers: &amp; chiefly when they doe well, they ſhall ſurely heare euill. But they muſt ſwallow vp the vnworthines of theſe euils, that they may not therefore ceaſe to do that which the Lord commanded the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; which he alloweth.
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:7788:85"/> Moſes is burdened here with a cruell falſe accuſation that he vſurpeth the authoritie of a ruler, &amp; by this means they lay treaſon to his charge. Secondly it is obiected vnto him reprochfully, that he ſlue an Egyptian? both theſe were very odious. Whereby we may gather with how dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous a temptation the mind of the holy man was ſtriken. And foraſmuch as we ſee that he was neither diſcouraged by exile, neither by any other euils, ſo that it did not repent him of his well doing, let vs alſo learne by his example, to beare a valiant and ſtrong minde and courage againſt all ſuch aſſaultes of Satan.</p>

The ſhifts &amp; ſleights of Satan are captious: we are more than bent naturally to diſtruſtfulnes, what doubts ſoeuer ariſe in our mindes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the worde of god, we do eaſily admit the ſame. It was a hard ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, to be thruſt from earthly delights, &amp; a ſumptuous life, vnto the painfull and baſe office of feeding ſheepe: and eſpecially foraſmuch as Moſes ſawe ſo muche time ſpent, and beeing in the meane ſeaſon ſent into the wilderneſſe, what other thing could he imagine with him ſelfe, but that that was vaine, &amp; a plain mock which the Lorde had promiſed? Foraſmuch as being now foureſcore yeres of age, he was occupied about the feeding of his father in law his ſheepe, when could hee haue hoped that there ſhould haue been any vſe of him in deliuering the people? It is good for vs ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times to cal to mind theſe cumbates of the godly vntil they be throughly imprinted in our memorie, leaſt our mindes faint, and our hearts faile vs, if the Lord make vs ſtay longer than we could wiſhe. Againe, Moſes giueth a notable example of modeſtie, ſeeing that in all that time hee attempteh nothing, he raiſeth no tumults, neitheir intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth himſelf any way, to beare rule: as troubleſome men vſe to doe: but employeth himſelfe in his ſheepheardes function, as diligently as if hee ſhould neuer haue been called vnto any greater charge.

               <p>
                  <hi>The Angel of the Lord appeared vnto him.</hi> It is firſt dema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded who this angel
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:7788:85"/> was: and ſecondly why he appeared in ſuch a forme? For after that Luke had called him an Angel, he bringeth him in immediatly ſpeaking thus: I am the God of Abraham &amp;c. Some anſwere. As God doth ſometime attribute and impart vnto his miniſters thoſe thinges which are moſt proper to himſelfe: ſo is it no abſurd or inconuenient thing if they haue his name giuen them. But ſeeing this Angel affirmeth manifeſtly, that he is the eternall God, who alone is, and in whom all thinges haue their being, we muſt needes reſtreine this title vnto the eſſence of God: for it can by no meanes agree to the Angels. It might be ſaide more fitly, that Becauſe the Angel ſpeaketh in the name of the Lorde, he taketh vppon him his perſon: as if he declared his commandements word for word, as out of the mouth of God. Which manner of ſpeaking is vſuall in the Prophets. But when Luke ſhal ſay afterward that this was the ſame An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, through whoſe aſſiſtance and guiding Moſes deliuered the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: and Paule in the tenth Chapter of the former to the Corinthians doth affirme that Chriſt was that guide,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 10.4.</note> there is no cauſe why we ſhould now wonder, that the Angel taketh to himſelfe that which is proper to God alone. Therefore let vs firſt of all ſet downe this for a ſuretie that there was neuer ſince the beginning any communication betweene god and men, ſaue onely by Chriſt. For wee haue nothing to doe with God, vnleſſe the mediatour bee preſent to purchaſe his fauour for vs. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this place, doeth plentifully proue the Diuinitie of Chriſt, and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth that he is of the ſame eſſenſe with the father. Furthermore he is called an Angel not onely bccauſe he had the Angels alwayes to beare him companie, and to be as it were his apparitours, but becauſe that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerance of the people did ſhadowe the redemption of vs all, for whoſe ſake Chriſt was to be ſent of his father, that he might take vpon him the ſhape of a ſeruaunt togither with our fleſh. It is certaine in deede that God did neuer appeare vnto men as he is, but vnder ſome ſhape, agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to their capacitie. Notwithſtanding there is another reaſon why Chriſt is called by this name, becauſe hee being appointed by the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall counſell of God to be vnto men the miniſter of ſaluation, doeth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare vnto Moſes to this ende. Neither is that contrarie to this doctrin, which is written in the ſeconde Chapter to the Hebrewes,<note place="margin">Hebr. 2.16.</note> that Chriſt neuer tooke the Angels, but the ſeede of Abraham. For although hee tooke vpon him the ſhape of an Angel for a time, yet did he neuer take the nature of Angels: as wee knowe that hee was made very man. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth that wee ſpeake ſomewhat of the burning buſh. That is common that God doeth applie the ſignes vnto the thinges by a certaine likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. And this is almoſt the common order and way of the ſacraments. Furthermore this was the fitteſt thing that could haue beene ſhewed to Moſes, to confirme his faith in the preſent buſineſſe. He knewe in what ſtate hee had left his nation, although there were a greater number of men, yet were they not vnlike to a buſh. For the thicker the buſh is, and the more ſtore of ſhrubbes it hath, the more ſubiect is it to take fire, that it may burn on euery ſide: ſo the people of Iſrael were but a weake band, and ſuch as was laide open to all iniuries, and this vnwarlike multitude
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:7788:86"/> being preſſed downe euen with their owne weight, hadde incenſed the crueltie of Pharao onely with the proſperous ſucceſſe of increaſing. Therefore the people being oppreſſed with cruell tyrannie, is as it were a pile of woode ſet on fire at euery corner, neither is there any thing which keepeth it from being conſumed to aſhes, ſaue this, becauſe the Lord ſitteth in the middeſt thereof. And although the vndoubted fire of perſecution did then burne, yet becauſe the Church of God is neuer free from afflictions in the world, the continuall eſtate thereof is after a ſort painted out in this place. For what other thing are wee but fewell for fire? And there flie abroad innumerable fire brands of Sathan conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, which ſet on fire both our bodies and alſo our mindes: but the Lord deliuereth &amp; defendeth vs by his wonderful and ſingular goodnes, from being conſumed. Therefore the fire muſt needs burne, that it may burne vs in this life: but becauſe the Lord dwelleth in the mids of vs, he ſhall ſo preſerue vs, that afflictions ſhal do vs no harme: as it is alſo ſaid in the ſixe and fourtith Pſalme.<note place="margin">Pſalm. 46.6.</note>

               <p n="31">31 <hi>He wondered at the viſion.</hi> Let vs know that God did vſe thus to deale with our fathers, that they might aſſuredly know his maieſtie. For hee meant to make a manifeſt diſtinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> betwene the viſions which he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the iuggling caſts of Satan. And this certaintie is more neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. For what credit ſhould the Oracles of God otherwiſe carry, wherein the couenant of eternall life is contained? Therfore foraſmuch as this a loue is the true ſtay of faith, it muſt needs haue God to bee the authour therof, that he may vndoubtedly declare that it is he that ſpeaketh. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain foraſmuch as Satan walketh about continually, &amp; doth by many &amp; ſtrange ſhifts inſinuate himſelf, and hath ſo many wayes to deceiue, and eſpecially ſeing he doth pretend the name of God craftilie: we muſt take great heed of his mocks. We ſee how in times paſt hee deluded all nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the Papiſts alſo. For all the monſters of ſuperſtitions, al the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of errors which were in times paſt, and do as yet reigne in popery, did proceede from dreames, viſions, and falſe reuelations. Yea further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more euen the Anabaptiſts haue their illuſions thence. Therefore this is the onely remedie, that God do diſtinguiſh by certaine markes thoſe viſions which he ſheweth. For then are we without da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger of erring, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he hath reuealed his maieſtie vnto vs. For this cauſe was the minde of Moſes ſtriken with admiration, and then afterward he draweth neere to conſider: after that he is come neerer, the Lorde toucheth him with a more liuely feeling of his preſence, ſo that he is afraide. For I confeſſe that ther is none of al theſe things which Sata<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cannot imitate: yet falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, like an Ape. And the Lord doth not only ſhew himſelf by ſuch ſignes, but helping our dulnes, he doth alſo open our eyes, that we may not be deceiued. Againe the holy ghoſt doeth imprint in our minds certaine marks &amp; tokens of Gods preſence, that there may no doubt remain.</p>
               <p n="32">32 <hi>I am the God of thy fathers.</hi> Now we ſee to what end the viſion was offered to Moſes, to wit, that the word of God might haue his authoritie. For bare viſions ſhould do but a little good, vnleſſe doctrine were ioyned therwithal. And it is ioyned with them not as an inferior part, but as the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:7788:86" rendition="simple:additions"/> cauſe of al viſions &amp; the end. And whereas he calleth himſelfe the God of Abraham, Iſaach, and Iacob, there is a double reaſon why hee calleth himſelfe ſo. As the maieſtie of God is infinite, if we will comprehend it, it doth rather ſwallow vp our ſenſes: if we indeuor to aſcend vnto it, we vaniſh away. Therefore he adorneth himſelfe with titles, vnder which we may comprehend him. But we muſt marke that God maketh choiſe of ſuch titles, as that he may by them call vs backe vnto his word. For he is called the God of Abraham, Iſaach, and Iacob, for this cauſe, becauſe he committed vnto them the doctrine of ſaluation, that he might there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by be made knowne to the worlde. But God had reſpect properly vnto the preſent circumſtance, when he ſpake to Moſes on this wiſe. For both this viſion, and the hope of the deliuerie of the people, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement which he was about to giue to Moſes, did depend vpon the couenant, which he had made in times paſt with the fathers. So that the ſuſpition of noueltie is taken way, and the minde of Moſes is lifted vp to hope for redemption, which was grounded in the olde promiſe. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this title is as much as if God had ſaide: I which haue promiſed in times paſt to your fathers, that I haue a care of your ſafetie, which haue taken the kinred of Abraham to my tuition by a free couenant, yea which haue appointed this time for an end of your bondage, I appeare now vnto thee, that I may performe that which I promiſed. Like as at this day all the promiſes of God muſt leane &amp; be ſtayed vpon this foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, that they may be ſure and certaine to vs, that God hath adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vs in Chriſt, and hath promiſed that hee will bee our God and our father. And Chriſt gathereth out of this place by good reaſon, that the godly liue after they be deade.<note place="margin">Mat. 22.32.</note> For if the whole man periſh in death, this were an vnfitte ſpeech, I am the God of Abraham. Let vs ſuppoſe that there is no Rome: ſhall not hee bee laught at, which ſhal call himſelfe Conſul of Rome? For this is requiſite in Relation, that the members be aunſwerable betweene themſelues. There is alſo another reaſon to be conſidered, that for as much as God hath in his hand both life and death, without all doubt he preſerueth thoſe aliue whoſe father he will be, and whom hee counteth his children. Therefore though A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, Iſaach, and Iacob, died concerning the fleſh, yet doe they liue in ſpirite with God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And Moſes being afraide.</hi> This might ſeeme to bee an abſurde thing, that a voyce full of conſolation doeth rather terrifie Moſes than make him glad: but it was good for Moſes to bee thus terrified with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, that hee might frame himſelfe vnto the greater reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence: Neither doeth the voice of God alone ſtrike his minde: but his maieſtie, whereof he ſaw a ſigne in the burning buſh. And what mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueile is it, if man bee afriade when hee feeth God? And eſpeciallie let vs remember, that mens mindes are by this meanes prepared vnto feare &amp; reuerence, as in Exod. xx. Thou haſt ſeen ſignes,<note place="margin">Exod. 20.22.</note> thou haſt heard the ſound of the trumpe, that thou maiſt learne to feare the Lord. But ſome wil ſay, Why dare not Moſes now for feare conſider, who was not afraid to draw neere before? I anſwere, that the neerer wee drawe vnto
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:7788:87" rendition="simple:additions"/> God, the more his glorie doth appeare, ſo are we the more afraide, and that by right. And God maketh Moſes afraide for none other cauſe, ſaue onely that he may make him obedient vnto him. This feare was a preparation not vnfit for greater boldnes. And to this end tendeth that which followeth, Put off thy ſhoes from thy feete, for he is admoniſhed by this ſigne with reuerence to receiue the commaundements of God, and to giue him due glorie by all meanes.</p>
               <p n="33">33 <hi>Becauſe the place wherein.</hi> The Lord meant by this commendation which he giueth to the place, to lift vp the minde of Moſes into heauen, that he might not thinke vppon any earthly thing. And if ſo be it Moſes was to be pricked forward with ſo many pricks, that hauing forgotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the earth, he might harken to God: muſt not we haue our ſides eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as it were digged through, ſeing wee are an hundreth times more ſlow than hee? Notwithſtanding here may a queſtion be asked, how this place became ſo holy? For it was no more holy than other places before that day. I anſwere that this honor is giuen to the preſence of God, and not to the place, and that the holineſſe of the place is ſpoken of for mans ſake. For if the preſence of God doe make the earth holy, howe much more force thereof ought men to haue. Notwithſtanding wee muſt alſo note, that the place was thus bewtified onely for a time, ſo that God did not fixe his glory there:<note place="margin">Gene. 35.7.</note> as Iacob erected an altar to God in Bethel, after that God had ſhewed ſome token of his preſence there. When as his poſterity did imitate the ſame afterward, it was ſuch worſhip as was reproued. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally the place is called holy for Moſes his ſake onely, that hee may the better addreſſe himſelfe to feare God, and to obey him. Foraſmuch as God doth now ſhew himſelfe vnto vs euery where in Chriſt, and that in no obſcure figures, but in the full light, and perfect truth, wee muſt not onely put off our ſhoes from our feete, but ſtrippe our ſelues ſtarke naked of our ſelues.</p>
               <p n="34">34 <hi>In ſeing I haue ſeene.</hi> God promiſeth nowe that he will deliuer his people, that hee may appoint Moſes to bee his miniſter afreſh; becauſe the former obiection was taken away by ſo long ſpace of time. For God is ſaide to ſee our miſeries, when hee hath reſpect to vs, and is carefull for our ſafetie: as he is ſaid againe, to ſhut his eyes, and turne his backe, when as he ſeemeth to ſet light by our cauſe. In like ſort is hee ſaide to come downe. He needeth not to moue out of his place to helpe vs, for his hand reacheth throughout the heauen and earth: but this is refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto our vnderſtanding. For ſeeing that he did not deliuer his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from their affliction, it might ſeeme that he was a farre off, and was buſied about ſome other thing in heauen. Nowe he ſaith that the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites ſhall perceiue that hee is nigh vnto them. The ſumme tendeth to this end, that Moſes knowing the will of God, may not doubt to follow him as a guide, and the more boldly to imploy himſelfe about the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery of the people, which he knew was the worke of God. For we muſt note that hee ſaieth that hee heard the <hi>mourning</hi> of the people. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he hath reſpect vnto thoſe which are in miſery, and vniuſtly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, yet when we lay our mournings &amp; complaints in his lap, hee is

               <p n="35">35 Stephen paſſeth ouer manie things, becauſe he maketh haſte vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this ſumme, that the Iewes may vnderſtande, that the fathers were not deliuered therefore, becauſe they had deſerued that with their god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, but that this benefite was beſtowed vpon them being altogither vnworthy: and ſecondly that there is ſome more perfect thing to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped for of theſe beginnings. When Moſes beeing ordained of God to be their reuenger and deliuerer, was nowe in a redineſſe, they ſtopt the way before him: therfore God doth deliuer them now, as it were againſt their will. That which is added touching myracles and wonders, ſerueth as well to the ſetting forth of the grace of God, as to make knowne the calling of Moſes. It is ſurely a ſtraunge thing, that God doth vouchſafe to declare his power by diuers wonders, for ſuch an vnthankful peoples ſake. But in the meane ſeaſon he bringeth his ſeruant in credite. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whereas the Iewes ſet leſſe by him afterwarde, whereas they aſſaie ſometimes to driue him away by railing, whereas they ſcould ſomtimes, ſometimes murmur, ſometimes ſet vpon him outragiouſly, they bewray thereby both their wickednes, and alſo their contempt of the grace of God. Their vnthankfulneſſe and vngodlineſſe was ſo encreaſed alwayes, that God muſt needs haue ſtriuen with woonderfull patience with ſuch a froward and ſtubburne people.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A ruler and a deliuerer.</hi> We muſt vnderſtande the contrarieties which augment the fault. They woulde haue obeyed Moſes if a tyrant had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed him to be a iudge, but they contemne him proudly and refuſe him diſdainefully being appointed of God, and that to bee a deliuerer. Therefore in deſpiſing him, they were wicked: and in reiecting grace, vnthankful. And wheras Moſes hath ſuch an honorable title giuen him, God doth not ſo giue and reſigne vnto man that honour which is due to himſelfe, that he looſeth any whit of his authoritie thereby. For doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe Moſes was not called a Redeemer or deliuerer in any other reſpect, ſaue onely becauſe he was the Miniſter of God. And by this meanes the glorie of the whole worke remaineth in the power of God wholy. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let vs learne, that ſo often as men haue the titles which belong to God giuen them, God himſelfe is not diſpoyled of his honour: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the worke is done by their handes, they are by this meanes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended.
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:7788:88"/> To this ende tendeth that which Stephen ſaieth, that this charge was committed to Moſes in the hand of the Angel. For by this meanes Moſes is made ſubiect to Chriſt, that vnder his conduct and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, he may obey God. For Hand is taken in this place not for mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie, but for principalitie. Wherefore God did ſo vſe the ſeruice of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that the power of Chriſt did ſurpaſſe him, as hee is euen at this day the chiefe gouernour in accompliſhing the ſaluation of the Church, yea he vſeth the miniſterie of men in ſuch ſort, that the force and effect de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth vpon him alone.</p>
               <p n="37">37 <hi>A Prophet ſhall God raiſe vp.</hi> Stephen indeuoureth vndoubtedly to proue by theſe words, that Chriſt is the ende of the Law: although hee doth not expreſſe the ſame in plaine words. And aſſuredly (as we haue alreadie ſaide) Luke reciteth not word for worde all thoſe things which Stephen vttered: but it is ſufficient for him to note the principal points of matters. Furthermore wee haue ſaide before in the thirde Chapter that this teſtimonie is ſo applied to Chriſt, that notwithſtanding it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth to the other prophetes alſo. For after that Moſes had forbidden the people to be carried to and fro with the wicked ſuperſtitions of the Gentiles, hee ſheweth what ought to followe. There is no cauſe (ſaith hee) why thou ſhouldeſt deſire Magicians and inchaunters: for God will neuer ſuffer thee to want Prophetes to teach thee faithfully. And nowe it is certaine that the miniſterie of the Prophetes was temporall, as was alſo the miniſterie of the Lawe: vntill Chriſt ſhoulde bring the full perfection of wiſedome into the worlde. Therefore Steephen his ſpeech tendeth to this end, that Moſes doeth not keepe the people faſt bounde to himſelf alone, when as he ſetteth before them and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vnto them another teacher. The Prophetes were in deede inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters of the Law, and all their doctrine was as it were an addition or appertenance of thoſe thinges, which were vttered by Moſes: but for as much as this was alſo certaine, that Chriſt ſhoulde bring a more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect kinde of doctrine, becauſe hee ſhoulde make an ende of all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies: it followeth that hee is made the chiefe: and that the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall maſterſhippe (that I may ſo call it) is his, leaſt the faith of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel ſhoulde be doubtfull. Nowe we knowe to what ende Stephen inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingleth Moſes his teſtimonie: to wit, that he may proue that the Iewes did no leſſe contemne him (of whom they made boaſt with open mouth to be their onely teacher) euen nowe when hee is deade, than they did in times paſt whiles hee liued wickedly, and frowardly reiect him.

               <p n="38">38 Stephen proceedeth to ſet foorth the frowardneſſe of the people, who though they were prouoked with ſo manie benefites of God, yet did they neuer ceaſe maliciouſly to reiect him. If they had beene diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient and vnthankfull to God before, yet this ſo wonderfull a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerance ought to haue brought them into a better minde: but he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth that they were alwayes like themſelues. It was meete that ſo many myracles ſhoulde not onely haue ſtuck faſt in their mindes, but alſo haue continued ſtill before their eyes. But hauing forgotten all, they flie backe ſodainlie vnto the ſuperſtitions of Aegypt. The memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall of their cruell ſeruitude was yet freſh, which they had eſcaped by paſſing ouer the redde ſea: and yet they preferre thoſe tyrantes by whom they were more than cruelly handled, before their deliuerer. This was therefore a heape of vngodlineſſe moſt deſperate, that their ſtubborneſſe coulde not bee broken or ouercome with ſo manie bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites of God, but that they did awayes returne vnto their nature. This doeth greatly augment the greatneſſe of the offence, where Steephen ſaieth that Moſes was then with them in the wilderneſſe. For beſides that there appeareth heere rare goodneſſe and long ſufferance of the Lord, in bearing with them, they make themſelues to be without all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, whiles that being beſet on euery ſide with ſo manie ſtraites, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought into ſo great diſtreſſe, hauing Moſes to bee their guide in their iourney, and the faithfull keeper of their life, they fall away ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe treacherouſly from God. Finally it appeareth that they were like vntamed beaſtes, whom God coulde not keepe in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with ſo manie bandes. Therefore in as much as Moſes lefte not off to gouerne them euen through the wilderneſſe vnder the conduct and aide of the Angel, it is an eaſie matter to gather by this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of time, how incurable and obſtinate their frowardneſſe was. As it was a point of monſtrous rebellion, not to be humbled with miſeries, and euen with the verie ſight of death. Where as hee ſaieth that Moſes was with the Angel and the fathers, there is a contrarie reſpect. Hee was preſent with the fathers, that hee might bee their guide, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the commaundement of the Lorde: he was with the Angell as a miniſter. Where vppon it followeth that hee was no priuate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to whom this iniurie was done, but it was done to the gouernance of God: when the people coulde bee kept backe with the reuerence of neither, from running headlong into wicked rebellion. We haue alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſpoken of the Angel. But the participle <hi>lalonutos,</hi> or, which ſpake, hath a double meaning. For it may be vnderſtoode either of the firſt viſion, wherby Moſes was called to redeem the people, or of that ſpeech which god had with Moſes, after they were come ouer the red ſea. And becauſe Chriſt declared both waies that he was the author of their deliuerance,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:7788:89" rendition="simple:additions"/> it is no great matter whether we chooſe: yea there is no let, but that it may be extended vnto both. For he which beganne to ſpeake to Moſes from the beginning, that he might ſend him into Aegypt, did continue the tenour of his ſpeech afterward, vntill the worke was finiſhed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Which receiued liuely Oracles.</hi> Eraſmus tranſlated it Liuely ſpeech: but thoſe which are expert in the Greek tongue, they ſhall know that I haue more truly tranſlated the words of Stephen For there is greater maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie in Oracles then in Speech. I ſpeake onely of the word: for I knowe that whatſoeuer proceedeth out of the mouth of God, the ſame is an Oracle. Moreouer hee purchaſeth authoritie for the doctrine of Moſes in theſe wordes, becauſe hee vttered nothing but that which proceeded from God. Whereupon it followeth that they did not ſo much rebell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Moſes as againſt God. Whereby their ſtubbernes is more diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. And this is a general way to eſtabliſh doctine: when men teach no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but that which is commaunded them by God. For what man dare make Moſes inferiour to him: who (as the Spirit affirmeth) ought onely to be beleeued for this cauſe, becauſe he faithfully vnfolded and deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the doctrine which he had receiued of God? But ſome man may ask this queſtion why he calleth the lawe a liuing ſpeech? For this title ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to diſagree much with the words of Paul:<note place="margin">1. Cori. 3.7.</note> where hee ſaith that the lawe is the miniſterie of death, and that it worketh death, and that it is the ſtrength of ſinne. If you take liuely ſpeech for that which is effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and cannot be made fruſtrate by the contempt of men, there ſhalbe no contrarietie: but I interpret it as ſpoken actiuely, for that which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to liue. For ſeing that the Law is the perfite rule of godly and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly life, and it ſheweth the righteouſneſſe of God, it is counted for good cauſes the doctrine of life and ſaluation. And to this purpoſe ſerueth that ſolemne proteſtation of Moſes, when he calleth heauen and earth to witneſſe, that hee hath ſet before them the way of death and life. In which ſenſe the Lord himſelf complaineth,<note place="margin">Ezechiel 20</note> that his good Law is broken, &amp; his good commandements wherof he had ſaid, He which ſhal do theſe things, ſhall liue in them. Therefore the Law hath life in it ſelfe. Yet if any man had leiffer take liuing, for that which is full of efficacie and ſtrength, I will not greatly ſtande in contention. And whereas it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the miniſterie of death, that is accidentall to it, becauſe of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature of man. For it doth not ingender ſin, but it findeth it in vs. It offereth life, but wee which are altogither corrupt, can haue nothing but death by it. Therefore it is deadly in reſpect of men alone. Though Stephen had reſpect vnto a farther thing in this place: for he doeth not onely ſpeake of the bare commaundementes, but comprehendeth all Moſes his doctrine, wherein the free promiſes are included, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently Chriſt himſelfe, who is the onely life and health of men. We muſt remember with what men Stephen had to doe. They were ſuch as were prepoſterouſly zelous of the law, who ſtayed onely in the dead and deadly letter of the Lawe: and in the meane ſeaſon they raged againſt Stephen, becauſe he ſought Chriſt in the Law, who is in deede the ſoule thereof.

<pb n="161" facs="tcp:7788:89"/> giueth them to vnderſtande, that there is ſome greater and ſome more excellent thing hidden in the Lawe, than they haue hitherto knowne. For as they were carnall, &amp; content with an outward ſhew, they ſought no ſpiritual thing in it, yea they would not ſo much as ſuffer the ſame to be ſhewed them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That he might giue them to vs.</hi> This ſerueth to refute the falſe accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wherewith he was falſely burthened. For ſeeing he ſubmitteth his necke to the yoke of the Lawe, and profeſſeth that hee is one of Moſes his ſcholers, hee is farre from diſcrediting him amongſt others. Yea, rather hee turneth backe the fault which was laide to his charge, vppon thoſe which were the authours of the ſlaunder. That was as it were a common reproch for all the people, becauſe the fathers woulde not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the Lawe. And therewithall hee telleth them, that Moſes was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be a Prophet, not onely for his time: but that his authoritie might be in force with the poſteritie, euen when he was deade. For it is not meete that the doctrine of God ſhoulde bee extinguiſhed togither with the miniſters, or that it ſhould bee taken away. For what is more vnlikely than that that ſhould dye, whereby wee haue immortalitie. So muſt wee thinke at this day: as the Prophetes and Apoſtle ſpake vnto the men of their time, right ſo did they write vnto vs, and that the force of their doctrine is continuall, becauſe it hath rather God to bee the authour thereof, than men. In the meane ſeaſon he teacheth, that if any reiect the word appointed for them, they reiect the counſell of God.</p>
               <p n="39">39 <hi>They refuſed and were turned away.</hi> Hee ſaith that the fathers reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Moſes: and hee ſheweth the cauſe alſo, becauſe they gaue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues rather vnto the ſuperſtitions of Aegypt: which was horrible and more than blind furie, to deſire the cuſtomes and ordinances of Aegypt, where they had ſuffered ſuch grieuous thinges of late. Hee ſaieth that they <hi>were turned away</hi> into Aegypt in their heartes, not that they deſired to returne thither bodily, but becauſe they returned in mind vnto thoſe corruptions, which they ought not ſo much as to haue remembred, without great deteſtation and hatred. It is true in deede, that the Iewes did once ſpeake of returning: but Stephen toucheth not that hiſtorie now. Furthermore he doth rather expreſſe their ſtubberneſſe, when he ſaieth that they were turned away. For after that they had taken the right way, hauing God for their guid and gouernour, they ſtart aſide ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly: as if a ſtubberne vnbroken horſe not obeying his rider, ſhoulde frowardly run backward.</p>
               <p n="40">40 <hi>Make vs.</hi> Though the Iewes bee turned backe diuerſe wayes, yet Stephen maketh choiſe of one notable example aboue all the reſt, of their filthy and deteſtable trecherie: to wit, when they made themſelues a Calfe, that they might worſhip it in ſteede of God. For there can no more filthy thing be inuented, than this their vnthankfulnes. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that they were deliuered out of Aegypt: neither do they denie that this was done by the grace of God and the miniſtery of Moſes: yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they reiect the author of ſo great goodneſſe togither with
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:7788:90"/> the miniſter. And vnder what colour? They pretend that they cannot tell what is become of Moſes. But they know full well that he is in the mount. They ſaw him with their eies when he went vp thither, vntil ſuch time as the Lorde tooke him vnto himſelfe, by compaſſing him about with a cloude. Againe, they know that Moſes is abſent for their healths ſake, who had promiſed that he would returne, and bring vnto them the Lawe which God ſhoulde giue. He badde them onely be quiet a while They raiſe madde vprores ſodainely within a ſmall time, and without any cauſe: yet to the ende they may couer their madneſſe with the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of ſome reaſon, they will haue Gods preſent with them, as if God had ſhewed vnto them no token of his preſence hitherto: but his glory did appeare daily in the cloud and piller of fire. Therefore we ſee what haſte they make to commit idolatrie through wicked contempt of god, that I may in the meane ſeaſon omitte to declare howe filthie and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked their vnthankfulnes was, in that they had ſo ſoone forgotten thoſe myracles, which they ought to haue remembred euen vntill the ende of the worlde. Therefore by this one backſliding it appeareth ſufficientlie what a ſtubberne and rebellious people they were. Moreouer it was more expedient for the cauſe which Stephen had in hand, to recite this hyſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of their rebellion than the other. For the people doeth quite ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe the worſhippe of God, they refuſe the doctrine of the Law, they bring in a ſtraunge and prophane religion. And this is a notable place, becauſe it pointeth out the fountain from which all maner of ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons did flowe ſynce the beginning, and eſpecially, what was the firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of making Idols: to wit, becauſe man which is carnall, will not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding haue God preſent with him, according to the capacitie of his fleſh. This is the cauſe why men were ſo bolde in all ages, to make Idols. And God doeth in deede apply himſelfe to our rudeneſſe thus farre, that he ſheweth himſelfe viſiblie after a ſort vnder figures. For there were manie ſignes vnder the Law to teſtifie his preſence. And he commeth downe vnto vs euen at this day by Baptiſme, and the Supper, and alſo by the externall preaching of the worde. But men offende two manner of wayes in this: for firſt being not content with the meanes which God hath appointed, they boldly get to themſelues new meanes. This is no ſmall fault, becauſe their fingers itch alwayes to haue new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions without keeping any meane, and ſo they are not afraid to paſſe the bounds which God hath appointed them. But there can be no true image of God, ſaue that which he appointed. Therefore what images ſo euer are feigned and inuented by man beſides his word, they are falſe &amp; corrupt. There is alſo another vice no leſſe intollerable, that as mans minde conceiueth nothing of God but that which is groſſe and earthly, ſo it tranſlateth all tokens of Gods preſence vnto the ſame groſſeneſſe. Neither doth man delight in thoſe idols onely, which hee himſelfe hath made, but alſo doth corrupt whatſoeuer God hath ordeined, by wreſting it vnto a contrary end. God commeth downe vnto vs in deede as I haue alredy ſaid: but to this ende, that he may lift vs vp into heauen with him. But we, becauſe wee are wholy ſet vpon the earth, will in like ſort haue
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:7788:90"/> him in the earth. By this meanes is his heauenly glorie deformed, and that fulfilled altogither which the Iſraelites ſay here, <hi>Make vs gods.</hi> For whoſoeuer he be that doth not worſhip God ſpiritually, he maketh vnto himſelfe a new God. and yet if yee throughly weigh al things, the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites will not haue a God made of ſet purpoſe by them, but they thinke rather that they haue the true and eternall God vnder the ſhape of the golden Calfe. For they are ready to offer the appointed ſacrifice, &amp; they approue that with their conſent, which Aaron ſaieth, that thoſe are the gods by whom they were brought out of Aegypt. But God paſſeth not for thoſe friuolous imaginations: but he complaineth that men put ſtrange gods in his place, ſo ſoone as they departe euen a verie little from his word.</p>
               <p n="41">41 <hi>And they made a Calfe.</hi> We may eaſily gather by that which goeth before, why they were more delighted in that figure than in any other. For although Aegypt did ſwarme with innumerable idols, yet it is well knowne, that they made the greateſt account of an Oxe. And whence is it that they are ſo deſirous to haue an Idoll, ſaue onely becauſe they were turned backe into Aegypt, as Stephen hath alreadie ſaid? We muſt note the ſpeech, when hee ſaieth that they offered ſacrifice to the Idoll. Aaron commaundeth the people to aſſemble themſelues togither to worſhip God: they come altogither. Therefore they teſtifie that they meane nothing leſſe than to defraud God of his worſhippe, howſoeuer they tranſlate the ſame vnto the Calfe. Yea rather they are determined, to worſhippe God in the image of the Calfe. But becauſe they forſooke the true God, by making an Idoll, whatſoeuer followeth afterward, it is iudged to be giuen to the Idol: becauſe God refuſeth al wicked worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping. For it is not meete to account that as beſtowed vpon him, which he hath not commaunded, and becauſe hee forbid them expreſly to erect any viſible image vnto him, that is meere ſacriledge what ſoeuer is done afterward in honour thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They reioyced ouer the workes.</hi> This ſpeech is taken out of Ieſaias, yea out of the Prophets, who in like ſort vpbraide vnto the Iewes that they were delighted in their owne inuentions. And ſurely it is wonderfull madneſſe, when men arrogate vnto themſelues any thing in Gods mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. I take this reioycing to bee that ſolemne daunſing whereof Moſes ſpeaketh in the two and thirtith Chapter of Exodus. Yet Stephen tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth a common vice, wherewith Idolaters are infected. For although it be altogither vnlawful for men to attempt any thing in religion which God hath not appointed: yet doe they inuent euery thing vnaduiſedly, and ſetting light by the word of God, they make choiſe of the workes of their owne handes. But Stephen ſheweth that whiles they take ſuch pleaſure in this libertie, they diſpleaſe God ſo much the more. But if we will haue God to allow our worſhip, we muſt abſtaine from the works of our hands, that is from our owne inuentions For all that which men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent of themſelues, is nothing elſe but ſacrilegious profanation. The Idol is properly ſo called reprochfully, as it were a thing nothing worth, becauſe no reaſon doth ſuffer man to make God.</p>

               <p>Steuen wil here declare, that the Iewes did neuer make an end of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but that they wandred farther in their froward errors: ſo that that firſt fal of theirs, was vnto them as it were an entrance into a Labyrinth. And this doth he aſſigne vnto the iuſt vengeance of God, that after that time their madneſſe grew ſo, that they gat for one Idoll infinite. This example teacheth vs to be careful to follow the rule which God hath ſet downe: becauſe ſo ſoone as wee are turned euen but a little a ſide from the ſame, we muſt needs be carried too and fro with diuerſe dotings, we muſt needs be intangled in many ſuperſtitions, and be vtterly drowned in the huge ſinke of errors. Which puniſhment God in iuſtice laith vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on men, which refuſe to obey his worde. Therefore Stephen ſaith that God was turned away; which word importeth as much as if he ſhoulde ſay, that he turned his backe. For hee had faſtened his eyes after a ſorte vppon the people, when hee ſhewed his ſingular care which he tooke in gouerning them, being offended with their falling away, nowe hee turneth his face another way. We may alſo hereby gather that we can no otherwiſe followe the right way, ſaue onely when the Lord watcheth ouer vs to gouerne vs: out ſo ſoone as his face is turned away, we runne by and by into errours. The Iſraelites were forſaken of God euen then, when they made the Calfe: but Stephen meant to expreſſe the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the puniſhment, as if he ſhould haue ſaide, that they were alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither caſt off into a reprobate ſenſe then, as Paule alſo teacheth, that thoſe which gaue not glorie to God when he had ſhewed himſelfe vnto them, were by the iuſt iudgement of God giuen vp vnto blindneſſe, and blockiſhneſſe,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.28.</note> and vnto ſhamefull luſtes. Hereby it came to paſſe, that after that religion began to bee corrupt, innumerable abhominations ſucceeded a fewe ſuperſtitions, and groſſe monſters of Idolatry, came in place of light corruptions. For becauſe men neglected the light which was ſet before them, they became altogither blockiſh by the iuſt iudgement of God, ſo that they had no more iudgement than bruite beaſtes. Idolatrie ſurely is very fertill, that of one feigned God, there ſhoulde by and by come an hundreth, that a thouſande ſuperſtitions ſhoulde flowe from one. But this ſo great madneſſe of men ſpringeth hence, becauſe God reuengeth himſelfe by deliuering them to Sathan: becauſe after hee hath once taken in hande to gouerne vs, there is no chaunge in his parte, but hee is pluckt away from vs by our raſh light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>

                  <hi>Haue yee offered vnto mee ſlaine beastes and ſacrifices.</hi> This place is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of the firſt Chapter of Amos. The ſpeech which Stephen vſeth
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:7788:91" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſheweth that all the prophecies were gathered into one bodie. And A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos addeth (after that he had inueighed againſt the Idolatrie and ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie ſinnes of the people) that this is no new euill, that the Iewes are rebellious againſt God, becauſe their fathers had fallen away from true godlineſſe euen in the wildernes. Furthermore he denieth that they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered ſlaine beaſtes to him, not becauſe there were there no ſacrifices at al, but becauſe god refuſed their corrupt worſhip: like as he reproueth &amp; chideth the people in Iſaias, becauſe they honored him with no ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, Thou (ſaith he) O Iacob, haſt not called vppon mee,<note place="margin">Iſa. 43.22.</note> neither haſt thou honored me with thy ſacrifices, neither haue I made thee ſerue in offering or incenſe. Thou haſt not bought for mee calamus, neither haſt thou filled mee with fatneſſe. But thou haſt beene burdenous vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me in thy ſinnes, and haſt cauſed me to ſerue in thine iniquities. Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly the Iewes did all theſe thinges daily, but God accepteth not the obedience of the wicked, neither doth he approue the ſame. Againe he abhorreth all that which is polluted with ſuch mingle mangles as are added. Thus doth Amos ſpeake of the fathers which were reuolts. That which is added forthwith, may bee referred either vnto them or vnto their poſteritie.</p>
               <p n="43">43 <hi>You tooke to you the tabernacle of Moloch.</hi> Some take the copulatiue for the aduerſatiue, as if he ſhould ſay, Yea rather yee worſhipped the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doll. It may be reſolued alſo into the coniunction cauſall, thus, You did not offer ſacrifices to me, becauſe yee erected a tabernacle to Moloch. But I expound it ſomewhat otherwiſe, to wit, that God doth firſt accuſe the fathers for the more vehemencie: and then afterwarde he addeth, that their poſteritie did encreaſe the ſuperſtitions, becauſe they gat to themſelues new and diuerſe Idols: as if the Prophet had ſpoken thus in the perſon of God, If I ſhall rippe vp from the beginning (O houſe of Iacob) howe your kinred hath behaued it ſelfe towarde me, your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers beganne to ouerthrowe and corrupt, euen in the wilderneſſe, that worſhippe which I had commanded: but you haue farre paſſed their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſſe, for you haue brought in an infinite companie of Gods. And this order is fitter for Stephen his purpoſe. For he intendeth to prooue (as we haue alreadie ſaid) that after the Iſraelites fel away vnto ſtrange and baſtardly rites: they neuer made an ende of ſinning: but being ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with blindneſſe, they polluted themſelues euer nowe and then with newe Idolatries, vntill they were come euen vnto the laſt end of impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Therefore Steephen confirmeth this ſentence fitly with the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of the Prophet, that the Iewes deſcending of wicked and rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous fathers, had neuer ceaſed to wax worſe and worſe. And although the Prophetes wordes be ſomewhat vnlike to theſe, yet is the ſenſe all one. It is to be thought that Stephen who had to deale with the Iewes, did repete worde for worde in their tongue, that which is in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet: Luke which wrote in Greeke, did followe the Greeke interpreter. The Prophet ſaieth Yee honoured Succuth your king, and Ciium your image, the ſtarre of your gods. The Greeke interpreter made a nowne common of anowne proper, becauſe of the aliance of the word Succoth,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:7788:92"/> which ſignifieth a Tabernacle. Furthermore I cannot tell whence he fetcheth that his Rempham; vnleſſe it were becauſe that word was more vſed in that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And figures which yee made.</hi> The worde Image which is in the Prophet, doeth of it ſelfe ſignifie no euill thing. Moreouer the worde <hi>typos</hi> is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken amongſt the Grecians in good part. For the Ceremonies which God appointed, are called <hi>typoi.</hi> Notwithſtanding the Prophet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth expreſlie the figures which the Iewes had made. Why ſo? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God will not be worſhiped vnder a viſible and externall forme. If any man obiect that hee ſpeaketh in this place, of ſtarres: that is true I confeſſe: but I ſtande onely vpon this, that although the Prophet doth giue their Idols ſome honeſt name, yet doeth hee ſharpely condemne their corrupt worſhippe. Whereby the fooliſh and childiſh cauilling of the Papiſtes is refuted. Becauſe they denie that thoſe images which they worſhippe, are Idols, they ſay that that madde worſhippe of theirs is <hi>eiconodouleia</hi> or ſeruing of Images, and not <hi>eidolodouleia</hi> or worſhiping of Idols. Seeing they mocke God ſophiſtically, there is no man that is indewed euen but with common vnderſtanding, which doeth not ſee that they are more than ridiculous euen in ſuch toyes. For although I mooue no queſtion about the woorde, it is certaine that the worde <hi>typos</hi> is more honourable than <hi>eiconos.</hi> But thoſe ſame typoi or figures are ſimplie condemned in this place, which men make to themſelues not onely <hi>pros ten latreian,</hi> or that they may worſhippe them, but <hi>pros ten proſcuneſin,</hi> that is, that they may giue them euen any reuerence at all. Therefore that filthie diſtinction falleth flat to the ground, wherein the Papiſts thinke they haue a craftie ſtarting hole.</p>

                  <hi>Beyond Babylon.</hi> The Prophet nameth Damaſcus: neither doeth the Greeke interpretation diſſent from the ſame. Wherefore it may be that the word Babylon crope in here through errour. Though in the ſumme of the thing there be no great difference. The Iſraelites were to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away to Babylon: but becauſe they thought that they had a ſure and ſtrong fortreſſe in the kingdome of Syria, whoſe head Damaſcus was: therefore the Prophet ſaith, that Damaſcus ſhall not helpe them, but that God ſhall driue them farther, as if hee ſhoulde ſay, So long as you haue Damaſcus ſet againſt your enimies, you thinke that you are well ſenſed: but God ſhall carry you away beyond it: euen into Aſſyria and Chaldea.</p>

For he ſaith that God had commaunded howe he would bee worſhipped by them. Whereupon it followeth that they were intangled in ſo manie er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, becauſe they would not follow that forme which God had appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Although he girdeth them for two cauſes: Becauſe being not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with that rule alone which God had preſcribed, they inuented to themſelues ſtrang worſhips: ſecondly becauſe they had no reſpect vnto the right end of the temple, and of the ceremonies which God had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. For wheras they ought to haue ben vnto them exerciſes of the ſpirituall worſhippe, they apprehended nothing but that which was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, according to their carnall nature, that is, they tooke the ſhadowe for the bodie.</p>
               <p>Therefore wee ſee that the Iewes were firſt reprehended for their boldneſſe, for becauſe that being not content with the plaine worde of God, they were carried away after their owne inuentions. Secondlie they are reprooued for the prepoſterous abuſe of the true and ſyncere worſhip: becauſe they followed the fleſh in ſteede of the Spirite. They had, ſaith he, the Tabernacle of witneſſe. Therefore it was their owne wantonnes and raſhneſſe onely, which cauſed them to ſinne. For ſeeing they were wel taught, what was the right way and order of worſhiping God, all cloake and colour of ignorance was taken away. Which thing is worth the noting. For ſeeing God doeth after a ſort bridle vs, when he maketh his will knowne vnto vs, if after we haue receiued his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, wee turne aſide either vnto the right hand or to the left, we be twiſe giltie: becauſe the ſeruaunt which knoweth his maſters will, and doeth it not, ſhall ſuffer more ſtripes. This is the firſt marke where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the holy Spirit doeth diſtinguiſh all baſtardlie and corrupt worſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings from the true and ſyncere worſhippe. Yea (to ſpeake more brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) the firſt difference betweene true worſhip and Idolatrie is this, when the godly take in hand nothing but that which is agreeable to the word of God: but the other thinke all that lawfull which pleaſeth themſelues: and ſo they count their owne wil a Law, whereas God alloweth nothing but that which hee himſelfe hath appointed.

<pb n="168" facs="tcp:7788:93"/> is oftentimes repeated, I will meete with you there. Therefore the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle was conſecrated by the couenant and worde of the Lorde, and his voice was hearde there continually, that it might bee diſtinguiſhed from all prophane places.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>According to the forme which hee had ſeene.</hi> This is referred vnto the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde point which I haue touched. For it may bee that hee which ſhall vſe the Ceremonies onely which God appointed, ſhall notwithſtanding worſhip God amiſſe for God careth not for externall rites, ſaue onely in as much as they are tokens of the heauenly trueth. Therefore God would haue the Tabernacle to bee made like vnto the heauenly figure, that the Iewes might knowe that they were not to ſtay ſtill in the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall figures. Furthermore let him which is diſpoſed, read my commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries vppon the Epiſtle to the Hebrewes,<note place="margin">Exo. 25.40.

Stephen doeth onely briefly tell them in this place that the worſhippe which God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded the Iewes, is ſpiritual, and that they according to their carnal blockiſhneſſe were euill and falſe interpreters. Therefore as wee haue ſaide that God alloweth no worſhippe but that which is grounded in his commaundement: ſo wee are taught heere, that it is requiſite in the right vſe of the commaundement, that the ſpirituall trueth be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.

               <p>Neither durſt Dauid him ſelfe after hee had taken it from the enemies, bring it into the threſhing floore of <hi>Areuna,</hi> vntil the Lord had declared by an Angell from heauen, that that was the place which hee had cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen. And Steeuen counteth this a ſingular benefite of God not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great cauſe, that the place was ſhewed to Dauid, wherein the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites ſhould hereafter worſhip God. As in the Pſalme,<note place="margin">Pſal. 132.3.</note> he reioyceth as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſome notable thing: I was glad when they ſaid vnto me, We will go into the houſe of the Lord, our feet ſhalbe ſtable in thy courtes, O Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem. The prieſthood was coupled with the kingdom. Therfore the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie of the kingdome is ſhewed in the reſting of the arke. Therefore it is ſaid that he deſired this ſo earneſtly, that he bound himſelfe with a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne vow, that he would not come within his houſe, that his eyes ſhuld enioy no ſleepe, nor his temples any reſt, vntill hee ſhould know a place for the Lord, and a tabernacle for the God of Iacob. Furthermore the place was ſhewed to Dauid,<note place="margin">1. Reg. 5.5.</note> but it was graunted to Salomon to build the temple.</p>
               <p n="47">47 <hi>Salomon built.</hi> Steeuen ſeemeth to gird Salomon glauncinglye in this place, as if he did not regard the nature of God in building the temple, yet did he attempt that work not without the commaundement of God. There was alſo a promiſe added, wherein God did teſtifie that he would be preſent with his people there. I anſwere that when Steeuen denieth that God dwelleth in temples made with hands, that is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred vnto Salomon, who knew full well that God was to bee ſought in heauen, and that mens mindes muſt be lifted vp thither by faith. Which thing he vttered alſo in that ſolemne prayer which he made. The hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens of heauens doe not containe thee: and how much leſſe this houſe? but he reproueth the blockiſhneſſe of the people, which abuſed the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: as if it had had God tied to it.<note place="margin">Iſay. 6.6.</note> Which appeareth more plainly by the teſtimonie of Iſaias, which he citeth alſo: God, ſaith he, wold haue Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to build him a temple, but they were greatly deceiued who thought that he was as it were included in ſuch a building: as he complaineth by his Prophet, that the people doe him iniurie when as they imagine that he is tyed to a place. But the Prophet doth not for that cauſe onely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueigh againſt the Iewes, becauſe they worſhipped. God ſuperſtitiouſly, thinking that his power was tied to the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, but bicauſe they did eſteem him according to their owne affection, and therfore after that they had ended their ſacrifices and externall pompe, they imagined that he was pleaſed, and that they had brought him indebted to them. This was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt a common errour in all ages, becauſe men thought that cold cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies were ſufficient enough for the worſhip of God. The reaſon is, becauſe for aſmuch as they are carnal &amp; wholie ſet vpon the world, they imagine that God is like to them. Therefore to the end God may take from them this blockiſhneſſe, he ſaith that he filleth all things.</p>
               <p n="49">49 For whereas hee ſaieth, that <hi>heauen</hi> is his ſeate, and the <hi>earth</hi> his footeſtoole: it muſt not be ſo vnderſtood, as if he had a body, or could be diuided into parts after the maner of men: but bicauſe he is infinit, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſaith, that he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be comprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded within any ſpaces of place.
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:7788:94" rendition="simple:additions"/> Therefore thoſe men are deceiued, who eſteeme God or his worſhip ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their own nature. And becauſe the Prophet had to deal with hypocrites, he doth not only diſpute about the eſſence of God: but alſo teacheth generally, that he is far vnlike to men, &amp; that he is not moued with the vaine pompe of this worlde, as they are. Here ariſeth that que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion alſo, why the Prophet ſaith that the Lorde hath no place of reſt in the worlde,<note place="margin">Pſal. 132.14</note> whereas notwithſtanding the Spirite affirmeth the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie els where, Pſal. 132. This is my reſt for euer. Moreouer Iſaias doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorne the church with this ſelfe ſame title, that it is the glorious reſt of God: alluding vnto the temple. I anſwere, that when GOD appointed ſignes of his preſence in the temple &amp; ſacrifices in times paſt, he did not this to the end he might ſettle and faſten himſelfe and his power there. Therefore the Iſraelites did wickedly, who ſetting their mindes wholy vpon the ſignes, did forge to themſelues an earthly God. They dealt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo vngodlilie, who vnder this colour tooke to themſelues libertie to ſin, as if they could readily &amp; eaſily pacifie god with bare ceremonies. Thus doth the world vſe to mock God. When God doth declare by the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall rites that he will be preſent with his, that he may dwell in the midſt of them, he commaundeth them to lifte vp their mindes, that they may ſeek him ſpiritually. Hypocrites which are intangled in the world, wil ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pluck God out of heauen: and wheras they haue nothing but vain &amp; bare figures, they are puft vp with ſuch fooliſhe confidence, that they pamper themſelues in their ſinnes careleſly. So at this day the Papiſts include Chriſt in the bread &amp; wine in their imaginatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: that don ſo ſone as they haue worſhipped their idoll with a fooliſh worſhip, they vaunte &amp; crack, as if they were as holy as angels. We muſt diligently note theſe two vices, that men do ſuperſtitiouſly forge to them ſelues a carnall and worldly God which doth ſo come down vnto them, that they remaine ſtill hauing their mindes ſet vpon the earth, &amp; that they riſe not vppe in mind to heauen. Again they dreame that God is pacified with friuolous obedience. Hereby it commeth to paſſe that they are befotted in the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſignes: &amp; ſecondly that they go about to bring God indebted to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> after a childiſh maner, &amp; with things which bee nothing worth. Now we vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in what ſenſe the prophet ſaith, that god hath no place of reſt in the world. He would indeed that the temple ſhould haue byn a ſigne &amp; pledge of his preſence, yet only to the godlie which did aſcend into heauen in heart, which did worſhip him ſpiritually with pure faith. But he hath no place of reſt with the ſuperſtitious, who through their fooliſh inuentions, tie him vnto the elements of the world, or do erect vnto him an earthly worſhip: neither yet with Hypocrites, who are puffed vp with dru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ken confidence, as if they had done their dutie toward god wel, after that they haue plaied in their toies. In ſumme, the promiſe receiued by faith, doth cauſe God to heare vs in his temple, as if he were preſent, to ſhew forth his power in the ſacraments: but vnleſſe we riſe vp vnto him by faith, we ſhall haue no preſence of his. Hereby we may eaſily gather, that when he dwelleth amidſt thoſe that be his, he is neither tyed to the earth, neither comprehended in any place, becauſe they ſeeke him ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuallie
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:7788:94" rendition="simple:additions"/> in heauen.</p>
               <p n="50">50 <hi>Hath not mine hande.</hi> The Prophete telleth the people in theſe words, that god hath no need either of gold, either of precious furniture of the temple, either of the ſacrifices: whereupon it followeth that his true worſhip is not conteined in ceremonies. For he deſireth none of all theſe things which we offer vnto him, for his own ſake, but only that he may exerciſe vs in the ſtudie of godlines, which argument is handeled more at large Pſal. 50. For although this be a ſhamefull fooliſhnes, to go about to feed god with ſacrifices: yet vnleſſe hypocrits were drowned in the ſame, they would make no ſuch account of toyes: becauſe all that is vnſauery before God, which diſſenteth from the ſpiritual worſhip. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let vs know that God ſeeketh vs &amp; not ours, which we haue only at pleaſure.

               <p n="51">51 For aſmuch as Steeuen doth not expreſly anſwere the points of the accuſation, I am of their minde who thinke that he would haue ſaid more, if his oration had not been broken off with ſome vprore. For wee know what a ſeſſions of iudges he had. Therefore no maruell if they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced him to hold his peace with noyſe &amp; outcries. And we ſee alſo, that he did vſe long inſinuation of ſet purpoſe, that he might tame &amp; appeace them, who were like brute beaſtes moſt cruell. But it is likely that their madneſſe was then incenſed, when hee proued that they had moſt wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly corrupt the law, that the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple was polluted with their ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, &amp; that there is nothing ſincere amongſt them, becauſe whiles they did ſticke in bare figures, they did not worſhip God ſpiritually: becauſe they did not referre the ceremonies vnto the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly figure. But thogh Steeuen did not enter the cauſe ſtraight way, but aſſayed to make their fierce mindes ſomewhat more gentle by little and little: yet did he rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon very fitly to purge him ſelf of the crime laid to his charge. Theſe two things, as we haue ſaid, were the principall points of the queſtion, That Steeuen had blaſphemed God and his temple, That hee went about to diſanull the lawe. That Steeuen might cleere himſelf of both theſe falſe flau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders, he bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at the calling of Abraham, &amp; declareth that the Iewes excelled the Gentiles, not of their own nature, not by any right of their own, not by any merites of workes, but by a f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 chunk">

                  </gap> priuiledge, becauſe god had adopted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the perſon of Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. This is alſo very pertinent to the cauſe, that the couenant of ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was made with Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, before any te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple or ceremonies were, yea before circumciſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was appointed. Of
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:7788:95"/> which things the Iewes did ſo boaſt, that they ſaid ther was no worſhip of God without them, neither any holineſſe. After that he ſet down how wonderfull and manifold the goodneſſe of God was towardes Abraham his ſtocke, and againe howe wickedly and frowardly they had refuſed ſo much as in them lay, the grace of God. Whereby it appeareth that it cannot bee aſcribed to their owne merites, that they are counted Gods people: but becauſe God did chooſe them of his owne accord being vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthie, &amp; did not ceaſe to do the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> good, though they were moſt vntha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>k<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. Their loftie and proude ſpirites might by this meanes haue bin ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, tamed, and humbled, that being emptied of that wind of fooliſhe glory, they might come vnto the mediator. Thirdly, he declared that the Angell was the gouernour and chiefe in giuing the lawe and deliuering the people: and that Moſes did ſo ſerue in his function, that hee taught that there ſhould come other prophets hereafter, who ſhould notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding haue one which ſhould be the chief of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that he might make an end of all propheſies, &amp; that he might bring the perfect accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them all. Whereby it is gathered that theſe are nothing leſſe than Moſes his diſciples, who reiect that kinde of doctrine which was promiſed and commended in the law, together with the authour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Laſt of all he ſheweth that all the olde worſhip which was preſcribed by Moſes, is not to bee eſteemed of it ſelfe, but that it ought rather to be referred to another end, becauſe it was made according to the heauenly paterne: and that the Iewes haue alwayes been wicked interpreters of the law: becauſe they conceiued nothing but that whiche was earthly. Hereby is it proued that there is no iniurie done to the temple and the lawe, when Chriſt is made as it were the end and truth of both. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſtate of the cauſe did conſiſt chiefly in this: that the worſhippe of GOD doeth not properlie conſiſt in ſacrifices and other things, and that all ceremonies did nothing els but ſhadow Chriſte. Steeuen was purpoſed to ſtand vppon this point, if the Iewes woulde haue permitted him: but becauſe when he was come to the pith of the matter, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not abyde to heare any more, they were ſo incenſed with furie; the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of thoſe things which hee had ſaid, vnto this cauſe which hee had in hand, is wanting. And he is inforced to vſe a ſharpe reprehenſion for a concluſion:<note place="margin">Exod. 32.9. &amp; 33.3.5.</note> 
                  <hi>Yee of an hard neck,</hi> ſaith he. We ſee how ſoone he is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with them with an holy zeale: but becauſe he ſaw that he ſpake many things to ſmall end, eſpecially before deafe men, he breaketh off his doctrine. This is a Metaphor taken from horſes or oxen, which Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes vſeth often, when he will ſay that his people is a rebellious people &amp; diſobedient to God, and alſo vnruly. The vpbraiding which foloweth, was of greater force with them. Circumciſion was vnto them a veile &amp; couering to couer all vices. Therefore when he calleth them vncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in heart, he doth not only meane that they are rebellious againſt god &amp; ſtubborn: but that they were found treacherous &amp; couena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers euen in that ſigne whereof they did ſo greatly boaſt, and ſo he tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth that backe moſt fitly to their ſhame, whereof they made boaſt to their glorie. For this is all one as if hee ſhoulde haue ſaid, that they had
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:7788:95" rendition="simple:additions"/> broken the couenant of the Lord, ſo that their circumciſion was void &amp; profane. This ſpeech is taken out of the law and the prophetes. For as god hath appointed the ſigne, ſo he would haue the Iewes know to what end they were circumciſed: to wit, that they might circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciſe their hearts and all their corrupt affections to the Lord, as we reade, And now cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſe your heartes to the Lorde.<note place="margin">Rom. 2.28.</note> Wherefore the letter of circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as Paule calleth it, is a vain viſure with God. So, foraſmuch as at this day, the ſpirituall waſhing is the truth of our baptiſme, it is to be feared leaſt that may well bee obiected to vs, that wee are not partakers of Baptiſme, becauſe our ſoules and fleſh are polluted with filthineſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Yee haue alwaies reſiſted.</hi> At the firſt Steeuen vouchſafed to call theſe men Fathers and brethren, againſt whom hee inueigheth thus ſharply. Therfore ſo long as there remained any hope, that they might be made more gentle, he dealt not only friendlie with them, but he ſpake honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly vnto them: now ſo ſoone as he eſpieth their deſperate ſtubborneſſe, he doth not only take from them all honour, but leaſt he ſhould haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie fellowſhip with them, he ſpeaketh vnto them as vnto men of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kinred. You, ſaith he, are like to your fathers, who haue alwayes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled againſt the ſpirit of God. But hee himſelfe came of the ſame Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: and yet that he may couple himſelfe to Chriſte, he forgetteth his kinred, in as much as it was wicked. And yet for al this, he bindeth them not all in one bundle as they ſay, but he ſpeaketh vnto the multitude. And thoſe are ſaid to reſiſt the Spirite, who reiect him whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſpeaketh in the prophetes. Neither doth hee ſpeake in this place of ſecrete reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, wherwith God inſpireth euery one: but of the externall miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. Which we muſt note dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly. He purpoſeth to take from the Iewes, all colour of excuſe. And therefore he vpbraideth vnto them, that they had purpoſely, and not of ignorance, reſiſted God. Wherby it appeareth, what great account the Lord maketh of his word, and howe reuerently he will haue vs to receiue the ſame. Therfore leaſt like Gyants we make warre againſt God, let vs learne to hearken to the miniſters, by whoſe mouth he teacheth vs.</p>
               <p n="52">52 <hi>Which of the Prophets.</hi> For aſmuch as they ought not to beare their fathers fault, Steeuen ſeemeth to deale vniuſtly, in that he recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth this amongſt their faultes, vnto whom he ſpeaketh: but he had iuſt cauſes ſo to doe. Firſt becauſe they did vaunt that they were Abraham his holy progenie, it was worth the labour to ſhew vnto them how great vanitie that was, as if Steuen ſhould ſay, that there is no cauſe why they ſhould vaunt of their ſtock, for aſmuch as they come of thoſe who were wicked murderers of the prophetes. So that he toucheth that glancing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, which is more plainly ſet downe by the prophetes, that they are not the children of prophetes, but a degenerate and baſtardly iſſue, the ſeed of Chanaan &amp;c. Which thing we may at this day obiect to the papiſtes, when as they ſo highly extoll their fathers. Furthermore, this ſerueth to amplifie withall, whereas he ſaith, That it is no new thing for them to reſiſt the truth: but that they haue this wickedneſſe, as it were by inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance from their fathers. Furthermore, it was requiſite for Steeuen by
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:7788:96" rendition="simple:additions"/> this meanes to plucke from their faces the viſure of the church, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they burthened him. This was an vnmeete preiudice againſt the doctrine of the Goſpel, in that they boaſted that they are the church of God, and did challenge this title by long ſucceſſion. Therefore Stee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen preuent them on the contrary, and proueth that their Fathers did no leſſe than they, rage againſt the prophets, through wicked con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and hatred of ſound doctrine. Laſtly this is the continual cuſtome of the ſcripture, to gather the fathers and children togeather vnder the ſame giltineſſe, ſeeing they pollute themſelues with the ſame offences, &amp; that famous ſentence of Chriſt anſwereth thereto. Fulfil the meaſure of your fathers vntill the iuſt blood come vpon you, from Abell vnto Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charias.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Who haue foretold.</hi> Hereby we gather that this was the drift of all the prophtes to direct their nation vnto Chriſt: as he is the end of the lawe. It were too long to gather all the propheſies wherein the comming of Chriſt was foretold.<note place="margin">Rom. 10.4.</note> Let it ſuffice to know this generally, that it was the common office of all the prophets to promiſe ſaluation by the grace of Chriſt. Chriſte is called in this place the Iuſt, not onely to note his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie, but of the effect: becauſe it is proper to him, to appoint iuſtice in the world. And euen in this place doth Steeuen proue that the Iewes were altogether vnworthie of the benefit of redemption: becauſe the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did not onely refuſe that in times paſt, which was witneſſed vnto them by the prophets, but they did alſo cruelly murther the meſſengers of grace: &amp; their children indeuored to extinguiſh the authour of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes and ſaluation which was offered vnto them. By which compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon Chriſte teacheth that the wicked conſpiracie of his enemies was an heape of al iniquities.</p>
               <p n="53">53 <hi>Who haue receiued the law.</hi> They called that furie wherewith they raged againſt Steuen, zeale of the law: as if he had been a forſaker of the law, &amp; a reuolt, &amp; had inforced others to fall away in like ſort. Although he was determined to cleere himſelf of this falſe accuſation, yet hee did not go through with his anſwer. For he could not be hearde, &amp; it was to no end to ſpeak to deaf men. Therfore he is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent at a word to take fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their falſe colour &amp; pretence. It is euident, ſaith he, that you lie when you pretend the zeale of the law, which you tranſgreſſe &amp; break without ceaſing: &amp; as he obiected vnto them in the words next going before, the treacherous murther of the Iuſt. ſo now he vpbraideth vnto them their reuolting from the lawe. Some man will ſay that Steeuens cauſe is no whit bettered hereby, becauſe the Iewes breake the law. But as wee haue alreadie ſaid, Steeuen doth not ſo chide them, as if his defence did prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſt in this iſſue, but that they may not flatter the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues in their falſe boaſting.

               <p>Which doctrine is very requiſite for vs vnto conſtancie. Thoſe which are teachers cannot do their dutie as they ought, but they muſt ſet the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And foraſmuch as there are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſome wicked men, which ſet light by the maieſtie of God, they muſt euer now and then, haue recourſe vnto this vehemencie of Steuen. For they may not winke, when Gods honour is taken from him. And what ſhalbe the end therof? Their vngodlines ſhalbe the more incenſed, ſo that we ſhall ſeeme to powre oyle into the fire (as they ſay). But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer come of it, yet muſt we not ſpare the wicked, but wee muſt keepe them downe mightilie: although they could powre out all the furies of hel. And it is certaine that thoſe which will flatter the wicked, doe not reſpect the frute, but are faint hearted through feare of daunger. But as for vs, howſoeuer we haue no ſuch ſucceſſe as we could wiſh, let vs know that courage in defending the doctrine of godlineſſe, is a ſweet ſmelling ſacrifice to God.</p>
               <p n="55">55 <hi>For aſmuch as he was full.</hi> We cannot almoſt expreſſe into what ſtraites the ſeruant of Chriſt was brought, when hee ſaw himſelfe beſet rounde with raging enemies: the goodneſſe of his cauſe was oppreſſed, partly with falſe accuſations and malice, partly with violence and outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious outcries: he was inuironned with ſterne countenaunces on euery ſide: he himſelfe was hailed vnto a cruell and horrible kinde of death, he could eſpie ſuccour and eaſe no where. Therfore being thus deſtitute of mans helpe, he turneth him ſelfe to warde God. We muſt firſt note this, that Steuen did looke vnto God, who is the iudge of life and death, (turning his eyes from beholding the world) when he was brought into extreeme deſpaire of all thinges, whiles that there is nothing but death before his eyes. That done, we muſt alſo adde this, that his expectation was not in vaine, becauſe Chriſt appeared to him by and by. Although Luke doth ſignifie, that he was now armed with ſuch power of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as could not be ouercome, ſo that nothing could hinder him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the heauens. Therefore Steuen looketh vp toward heauen, that he may gather courage by beholding Chriſt, that dying he may triu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>phe gloriouſly, hauing ouercom death. But as for vs, it is no maruel if Chriſt doe not ſhew himſelf to vs, becauſe we are ſo ſet &amp; tyed vpon the earth. Hereby it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to paſſe, that our harts faile vs at euery light rumor of danger, and euen at the falling of a leafe. And that for good cauſes, for where is our ſtrength but in Chriſt? But we paſſe ouer the heauens, as if we had no helpe any where els, ſaue only in the world. Furthermore this vice can be redreſſed by no other meanes, then if God lift vs vp by his Spirit being naturally ſet vpon the earth. Therefore Luke aſſigneth this cauſe, why Steue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> loked vp ſtedfaſtly toward heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: becauſe he was full of the ſpirite. We muſt alſo aſcend into heauen hauing this ſpirite to be our directer and guid, ſo often as we are oppreſſed with troubles. And ſurely vntill ſuch time as he illuminate vs, our eyes are not ſo quicke of ſight, that they can come vnto heauen. Yea the eyes of the fleſhe are ſo dull, that they cannot aſcend into heauen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hee ſaw the glory of God.</hi> Luke ſignifieth as I haue ſaid, that Chriſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:7788:97" rendition="simple:additions"/> foorthwith to Steuen ſo ſoone as he lifted vp his eyes towards heauen. But he telleth vs before, that he had other eyes giuen him than the fleſhly eyes, ſeeing that with the ſame he flieth vp vnto the glory of God. Whence we muſt gather a generall comfort, that God will be no leſſe preſent with vs, if forſaking the worlde, all our ſenſes ſtriue to come to him: not that he appeareth vnto vs by any externall viſion, as hee did to Steeuen, but he will ſo reueale himſelfe vnto vs within, that wee may in deed feele his preſence. And this maner of ſeeing ought to be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for vs, when God doth not only by his power and grace declare that he is nigh at hand, but doth alſo proue that hee dwelleth in vs.</p>
               <p n="56">56 <hi>Behold I ſee the heauens.</hi> God ment not only priuately to prouide for his ſeruant, but alſo to wring and torment his enemies: as Steeuen doth couragiouſly triumph ouer them, when he affirmeth plainely that he ſaw a myracle. And here may a queſtion be moued, how the heauens were opened. For mine owne part, I think that there was nothing chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in the nature of the heauens: but that Steeuen had new quickneſſe of ſight graunted him, which pearced through all lets euen vnto the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſible glory of the kingdome of heauen. For admit we graunt, that there was ſome diuiſion or parting made in heauen, yet mans eye could neuer reach ſo farre. Againe, Steeuen alone did ſee the glory of God. For that ſpectacle was not only hid fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the wicked, who ſtoode in the ſame place, but they were alſo ſo blinded within themſelues, that they did not ſee the manifeſt truth. Therefore hee ſaith, that the heauens are opened to him in this reſpect, becauſe nothing keepeth him from beholding the glory of God. Whereupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it foloweth that the myracle was not wrought in heauen, but in his eyes. Wherefore there is no cauſe, why we ſhould diſpute long about any naturall viſion: becauſe it is certaine that Chriſt appeared vnto him not after ſome naturall maner, but after a new &amp; ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular ſort. And I pray you of what colour was the glory of GOD, that it could be ſeen naturally with the eyes of the fleſh? Therefore wee muſt i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine nothing in this viſion, but that which is diuine. Moreouer, this is worth the noting, that the glory of God appeared not vnto Steeuen wholy as it was, but according to mans capacitie. For that infiniteneſſe cannot be comprehended with the meaſure of any creature.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The ſonne of man ſtanding.</hi> Hee ſeeth Chriſte reigning in that fleſhe, wherin he was abaſed: ſo that in very deed the victorie did conſiſt in this one thing. Therefore it is not ſuperfluous, in that Chriſt appeareth vnto him, and for this cauſe doth he alſo call him the ſonne of man, as if hee ſhoulde ſay, I ſee that man, whom yee thought yee had quite extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by death, enioying the gouernment of heauen: therfore gnaſh with your teeth as much as you liſt: there is no cauſe why I ſhoulde feare to fight for him euen vnto blood, who ſhall not only defend his own cauſe, but my ſaluation alſo. Notwithſtanding here may a queſtion be moued, why he ſaw him ſtanding, who is ſaid elswhere to ſit. Auguſtine as hee is ſometimes more ſubtill than needes, ſaieth, that hee ſitteth as a iudge, that hee ſtoode then as an aduocate. For mine owne part I thinke that though theſe ſpeeches be diuers, yet they ſignifie both one thing, For
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:7788:98" rendition="simple:additions"/> neither ſitting, ne yet ſtanding noteth out, how the body of Chriſt was framed: but this is referred vnto his power &amp; kingdome. For where ſhal wee erect him a throne, that hee may ſit at the right hande of God the Father: ſeeing God doth fill all things in ſuch ſort, that wee ought to y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine no place for his right hand? Therefore the whole text is a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor, when Chriſt is ſaid to ſit or ſtande at the right hande of God the Father, and the plaine meaning is this, that Chriſt hath all power giuen him, that he may raigne in his Fathers ſteede in that fleſh wherein hee was humbled, and that he may be next him. And although this power be ſpread abroad through heauen and earth, yet ſome men imagine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe, that Chriſte is euery where in his humane nature. For though he be contained in a certaine place, yet that hindereth no whit, but that he may and doth ſhewe foorth his power throughout all the whole world. Therefore if wee bee deſirous to feele him preſent by the working of his grace, we muſt ſeeke him in heauen: as he reuealed himſelfe vnto Stee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen there. Alſo ſome men doe affirme ridiculouſly out of this place, that he drewe neere vnto Steeuen that hee might ſee him. For wee haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie ſaide that Steeuen his eyes were ſo lifted vp by the power of the Spirite, that no diſtance of place coulde hinder the ſame. I confeſſe in deed that ſpeaking properly, that is, philoſophically, there is no place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the heauens. But this is ſufficient for mee, that it is peruers doting to place Chriſte any where els, ſaue only in heauen, and aboue the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the world.</p>
               <p n="57">57 <hi>Crying with a loude voice.</hi> This was either a vaine ſhew of zeale, as hypocrites are almoſt alwayes pricked forwarde with ambition, to breake out into immoderate heate as Caiphas when hee heard Chriſte ſay thus, After this yee ſhal ſee the ſonne of man &amp;c. did rent his clothes in token of indignation, as if it were intollerable blaſphemie: or els cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely the preaching of the glory of Chriſte was vnto them ſuch a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that they muſt needes burſt through madneſſe. And I am rather of this minde for Luke ſaith afterward, that they were carried violently as thoſe men which haue no hold of themſelues, vſe to leape out immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately.</p>
               <p n="58">58 <hi>They ſtoned.</hi> God had appointed this kinde of puniſhement in the lawe, for falſe Prophetes: as it is written in the thirteenth chapter of Deuteronomie: but God doth alſo define there, who ought to be recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in that number: to wit, he which doth attempt to bring the people vnto ſtrange Goddes, therefore the ſtoning of Steeuen was both vniuſt and alſo wicked, becauſe he was vniuſtly condemned. So that the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs of Chriſte muſt ſuffer like puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t with the wicked. It is the cauſe alone which maketh the difference: but this difference is ſo highly eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med before God and his angels, that the rebukes of the martyrs doe far excell al glory of the worlde. Yet here may a queſtion bee moued, How it was lawfull for the Iewes to ſtone Steuen who had not the gouernment in their hands. For in Chriſts cauſe they anſwere, It is not lawfull for vs to put any man to death. I anſwere, that they did this violently and in an vproare. And whereas the preſident did not puniſh this wickedneſſe,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:7788:98" rendition="simple:additions"/> it may be that he winked at many things, leaſt he ſhould bring that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred vpon his owne head which they bare againſt the name of Chriſte. Wee ſee that the Romane preſidentes did chiefly winke at the ciuil diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordes of that nation euen of ſet purpoſe: that when one of them had murthered another, they might the ſooner be ouercome afterward.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the witneſſes laide downe their cloathes at a young mans feete, named Saul.</hi>

                  <p n="59">

                     <hi>60</hi> And he kneeled downe, and cryed with a loude voyce: Lord, lay not this ſinne to their charge. And when he had ſaid thus, he fell on ſleepe.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>And the witneſſes.</hi> Luke ſignifieth that euen in that tumult they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued ſome ſhewe of iudgement. This was not commaunded in vaine that the witneſſes ſhoulde throwe the firſt ſtone: becauſe ſeeing they muſt committe the murther with their owne handes, many are holden with a certaine dread, who otherwiſe are leſſe afraide to cut the throtes of the innocent with periurie of the tongue. But in the meane ſeaſon we gather how blinde and madde the vngodlineſſe of theſe witneſſes was, who are not afraide to imbrue their blooddie handes with the blood of an innocent, who had alreadie committed murther with their tongues. Whereas hee ſaith, that their cloathes were laid downe at the feete of Saul, he ſheweth that there was no let in him, but that beeing caſt into a reprobate ſenſe, he might haue periſhed with the reſt. For who woulde not thinke that he was deſperate, who had infected his youth with ſuch crueltie? Neither is his age expreſſed to leſſen his fault, as ſome vnskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full men goe about to prooue: for he was of thoſe yeeres, that want of knowledge coulde no whit excuſe him. And Luke will ſhortly after de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that he was ſent by the high Prieſt to perſecute the faithful. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was no childe, he might well be counted a man. Why then is his youth mentioned? That euery man may conſider with him ſelfe, what great hurt he might haue done in Gods Church, vnleſſe Chriſte hadde brideled him betimes. And therin appeareth a moſt notable token both of Gods power, and alſo of his grace, in that he tamed a fierce and wilde beaſt in his chiefe furie, euen in a moment, and in that he extolled a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable murtherer ſo highly, who through his wickedneſſe was drowned almoſt in the deepe pit of hell.</p>
               <p n="59">59 <hi>Calling on.</hi> Becauſe he had vttered wordes enough before men though in vaine, he turneth himſelfe now vnto God for good cauſes, and armeth himſelfe with prayer to ſuffer all thinges. For although we haue need to run vnto Gods help euerie minute af an houre during our whole warfare, yet we haue greateſt need to call vpon God in the laſt conflict which is the hardeſt.</p>
               <p>And Luke expreſſeth again how furious mad they were: becauſe their
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:7788:99" rendition="simple:additions"/> crueltie was not aſwaged euen when they ſaw the ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Chriſt pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing humbly. Furthermore, here is ſet downe a prayer of Steeuen hauing two members. In the former member where he commendeth his ſpirite to Chriſt, he ſheweth the conſtancie of his faith. In the other, where he prayeth for his enemies, he teſtifieth his loue towarde men. Foraſmuch as the whole perfection of godlineſſe conſiſteth vpon theſe two partes, we haue in the death of Steeuen a rare example of a godly &amp; holy death. It is to be thought that he vſed many mo words, but the ſumme tendeth to this end.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lord Ieſu.</hi> I haue alreadie ſaid, that this prayer was a witneſſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence: and ſurely the couragiouſneſſe and valiauntneſſe of Steeuen was great, that when as he ſaw the ſtones flie about his eares, wherewith he ſhould be ſtoned by and by, when as he heareth cruell curſes and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proches againſt his head, hee yet ſtayeth himſelfe meekely vppon the grace of Chriſt. In like ſort the Lord wil haue his ſeruants to be brought to nought as it were ſometimes, to the end their ſaluation may bee the more wonderfull. And let vs define this ſaluation not by the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of our fleſh but by faith. Wee ſee how Steeuen leaneth not vnto the iudgement of the fleſh, but rather aſſuring himſelfe euen in very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction that he ſhalbe ſaued, he ſuffereth death with a quiet mind. For vndoubtedly he was aſſured of this,<note place="margin">Col. 3.3.</note> that our life is hid with Chriſte in God.</p>
               <p>Therefore caſting off all care of the bodie, hee is content to commit his ſoule into the handes of Chriſte. For hee coulde not pray thus from his heart, vnleſſe hauing forgotten this life, he had caſt of all care of the ſame.<note place="margin">Pſal. 31.6.</note> It behoueth vs with Dauid to commit our ſoules into the handes of God daylie, ſo long as we are in the worlde, becauſe we are inuironed with a thouſand deaths: that God may deliuer our life from all dangers: but when we muſt die indeed, and we are called thereunto, we muſt flie vnto this prayer, that Chriſte will receiue our ſpirite. For hee commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his owne Spirite into the handes of his Father, to this end that hee may keepe ours for euer. This is an vneſtimable comfort, in that wee knowe our ſoules doe not wander vppe and downe when they flit out of our bodies, but that Chriſt receiueth them, that hee may keepe them faithfully, if wee commend them into his handes. This hope ought to encourage vs to ſuffer death patiently. Yea whoſoeuer commendeth his ſoule to Chriſt with an earneſt affection of faith, he muſt needes reſigne himſelfe wholy to his pleaſure and will. And this place doth plainelie teſtifie that the ſoule of man is no vaine blaſt, which vaniſheth away, as ſome frantike fellowes imagine dotingly, but that it is an Eſſentiall ſpirite, which liueth after this life. Furthermore wee are taught hereby, that we call vpon Chriſt rightly and lawfully, becauſe all power is giuen him of the Father for this cauſe, that all men may commit themſelues to his tuition.</p>
               <p n="60">60 <hi>Kneeling down, he cried.</hi> This is the other part of his prayer, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he ioyneth the loue of men with faith in Chriſt: and ſurely if we deſire to be gathered to Chriſt for our ſaluation, we muſt put on this affection.
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:7788:99" rendition="simple:additions"/> Whereas Steeuen prayeth for his enemies, and thoſe moſt deadly, and euen in the very inſtant, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their crueltie might prouoke him vnto de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of reuenge, he declareth ſufficiently what affection hee beareth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward all other men. And we know that we are all commanded to do the ſame which Steuen did:<note place="margin">Mat. 5.93.94.</note> but becauſe there is nothing more hard than ſo to forgiue iniuries, that we will wiſh wel to thoſe who would haue vs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, therfore we muſt alwaies ſet Steeuen before our eyes for an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. He crieth in deed with a loud voice, but he maketh ſhew of nothing before men, which was not ſpoken ſincerely and from the heart, as God himſelfe doth witneſſe. Yet he cryeth aloud, that he may omit nothing which might ſerue to aſſwage the cueltie of the enemies. The fruite ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared not foorthwith, yet vndoubtedly he prayed not in vaine: &amp; Paule is vnto vs a ſufficient teſtimonie, that this ſinne was not laide to all their charges. I will not ſay as Auguſtin, that vnleſſe Steeuen had prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the church ſhould not haue had Paul: for this is ſomwhat hard: only I ſay this, that whereas God pardoned Paul, it appeareth thereby, that Steeuen his prayer was not in vaine. Here ariſeth a queſtion, How Stee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen prayeth for thoſe, which he ſaid of late, did reſiſt the holy ghoſt. but this ſeemeth to be the ſinne againſt the Spirit, which ſhall neuer be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen. We may eaſily anſwere, that that is pronounced generally of all, which belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geth to many euery where. Therfore he called not the body of the people rebellious in ſuch ſort, that he exempted none: againe I haue declared before, what manner of reſiſting hee condemned in that place: for it followeth not by and by that they ſin againſt the holy ghoſt, who reſiſt him for a time. When he prayeth, that God will not lay the ſinne to their charge, his meaning is, that the guiltines may not remain in them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And when hee had ſaid thus, hee fell on ſleepe.</hi> This was added that wee may knowe that theſe wordes were vttered euen when he was readie to yeeld vppe the Ghoſte, which is a token of wonderfull conſtancie: alſo this word <hi>ſleepe</hi> noteth a meeke kind of death. Nowe becauſe hee made this prayer when he was at the point of death, hee was not moued with any hope of obtaining pardon, to bee ſo careful to appeaſe his enemies: but only that they might repent. When this worde <hi>ſleepe</hi> is taken in the ſcripture for to die, it muſt bee referred vnto the bodie: leaſt any man imagine fooliſhly with vnlearned men, that the ſoules doe alſo ſleepe.</p>

For the wicked are like brute beaſtes, for when they haue once ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted blood, they are more deſirous thereof, and become more cruel tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitting murther. For Sata<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who is the father of all crueltie, doeth firſt take from them all feeling of humanitie, when they are once imbru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with innocent blood: that done he ſtirreth vp in them an vnquench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able thirſting after blood: whence thoſe violent aſſaults to commit mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, come: ſo that when they haue once begun, they wil neuer make an end, with their will. Moreouer, when they haue power once graunted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to doe hurt, their boldneſſe encreaſeth in tract of time, ſo that they are caried headlong more immoderately, which thing Luke alſo noteth when he ſaith, The perſecution was great. Vndoubtedly the church had but ſmal reſt before, neither was it free from the vexatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the wicked, but the Lord ſpared his for a time, that they might haue ſome libertie: &amp; now they began to be ſorer ſet on. Theſe thinges muſt be applyed vnto our time alſo. If the furiouſneſſe of our enemies ſeeme at any time to be as it were fallen on ſleepe, ſo that it caſteth not out flames farre: let vs knowe that the Lorde prouideth for our weakneſſe: yet let vs not in the meane ſeaſon imagine that we ſhall haue continuall truce, but let vs bee in readineſſe to ſuffer ſorer bruntes, as often as they ſhall breake out ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainely. Let vs alſo remember, that if at any time the conſtancie of one man haue whetted the crueltie of our enemies, the blame of the euill is vniuſtly aſcribed to him. For Luke doth not defame Steeuen, when as he ſaith, that by meanes of him the church was ſorer vexed than before: but he rather turneth this to his praiſe, becauſe he did valiauntly as the Standard-bearer encourage others with his example, to fight couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly. When he calleth it the church which was at Ieruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, his meaning is not, that there were churches elswhere, but he paſſeth ouer vnto theſe things which enſued thereupon. For whereas there was but this one on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly body of the godly in al the world, it was rent in peeces through flight: yet there ſprang vp more churches by and by of thoſe lame members, which were diſperſed heere and there, and ſo the body of Chriſte was ſpread abroad farre and wide, whereas it was before ſhut vp within the
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:7788:100"/> walles of Ieruſalem.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They were all ſcattered abroad.</hi> It is certain that they were not all ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered abrode, but the ſcripture vſeth an vniuerſall note, for that which we ſay, Euery where, or abroad. The ſumme is this, that not only a fewe were in danger: becauſe the crueltie of the enemies raged throughout the whole church. Many doe oftentimes take themſelues to their feete, through faintneſſe of hearte, euen when they heare any light rumour, but theſe are in another caſe. For they fled not vnaduiſedly beeing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, but becauſe they ſawe no other meanes to pacifie the furie of the aduerſaries. And he ſaith that they were ſcattered not only through diuers places of Iudea, but that they cam euen vnto Samaria: ſo that the middle wall began to be pulled down,<note place="margin">Ephe. 2.14.</note> which made diuiſion between the Iewes and the Gentiles. For the conuerſion of Samaria, was as it were the firſt frutes of the calling of the Gentiles. For although they had cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion as had the people of God, yet wee know that there was great diſſention, and that not without great cauſe, foraſmuche as they had in Samaria only a forged worſhip of god, as Chriſt affirmeth, bicauſe it was only an vnſauerie emulation. Therefore God ſet open the gate for the goſpel then, that the ſcepter of Chriſt ſent out of Ieruſalem, might come vnto the Gentiles. He exempteth the Apoſtles out of this number, not that they were free from the common daunger: but becauſe it is the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of a good paſtour, to ſet him ſelfe againſt the inuaſions of wolues, for the ſaftie of his flocke. But here may a queſtion bee asked, foraſmuch as they were commaunded to preach the Goſpel throughout the whole world, why they ſtayed at Ieruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,<note place="margin">Mark. 16.16</note> euen when they were expelled the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce with force and hand? I anſweare, that ſeeing Chriſte had commaunded them to begin at Ieruſalem, they employed themſelues there, vntill ſuch time as beeing brought into ſome other place by his hand, they might knowe for a ſuretie that he was their guide. And wee ſee how fearefully they proceeded to preache the Goſpell: not that they foreſlowed that function which was inioyned them: but becauſe they were amaſed at a newe and vnwonted thing.</p>
               <p>Therefore ſeeing they ſee the Goſpell ſo mightily reſiſted at Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, they dare goe to no other place, vntil ſuch time as they haue broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that firſt huge heape of ſtraites. Aſſuredly they prouide neither for their caſe, ne yet for their owne commodities, eyther for beeing voide of care, by ſtaying at Ieruſalem: for they haue a painefull charge: they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually amiddeſt diuers daungers, they encounter with great troubles: wherfore vndoubtedly they are purpoſed to do their dutie. And eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, wheras they ſtand to it, when all the reſt flie, that is an euident te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie of valiant conſtancie. If any man obiect, that they might haue diuided the Prouinces amongeſt them, that they might not all haue been occupied in one place: I anſwere, that Ieruſalem alone had buſines enough for them all.</p>
               <p>In ſum, Luke reckoneth vp this as a thing worthie of prayſe, that they followed not the reſt into voluntarie exile, to auoid perſecution: and yet he doth not reprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the flight of thoſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whoſe ſtate was more free.
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:7788:101" rendition="simple:additions"/> For the Apoſtles did conſider what particular thing their calling hadde: to wit, that they ſhould keepe their ſtanding, ſeeing the wolues did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uade the ſheepefolde. The rigour of Tertullian and ſuch like was too great, who did deny indifferently that it is lawful to flie for fear of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. Auguſt. ſaith better, who giueth leaue to flie in ſuch ſort that the churches beeing deſtitute of theyr Paſtours, bee not betrayed into the hands of the enemies.</p>
               <p>This is ſurely the beſt moderation, which beareth neither too muche with the fleſh, neither driueth thoſe headlong to death, who may lawe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſaue their liues. Let him that is diſpoſed reade the 180. Ep. to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noratus. That I may returne to the Apoſtles, if they had been ſcattered here and there with feare of perſecution, euen at the beginning, all men might haue rightly called them hirelings. How hurtfull and filthie had the forſaking of the place bin, at the preſent time? how greatly wold it haue diſcouraged the mindes of all men? What great hurt ſhould they haue done with their example among the poſteritie? It ſhall ſometimes ſo fall out in deede, that the paſtour may alſo flie: that is, if they inuade him alone, if the laying waſte of the church be not feared, if hee bee ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. But and if both his flocke and hee haue to encounter with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſarie, hee is a treacherous forſaker of his office, if hee ſtande not ſtoutlye to it euen vntill the end. Priuate perſons haue greater liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>They dreſſed Steeuen.</hi> Luke ſheweth that euen in the heat of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, the godly were not ſo diſcouraged, but beeing alwayes zealous, they did thoſe dueties which did belong to godlineſſe. Buriall ſeemeth to be a matter of ſmall importance: rather than they will foreſlowe the ſame, they bring themſelues in no ſmall haſſarde of life. And as the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of time doth declare that they contemned death valiantly: ſo againe wee gather thereby that they were carefull to doe this thing not without great and vrgent cauſe. For this ſerued greatly to exerciſe their faith, that the bodie of the holy martyr ſhoulde not bee left to the wilde beaſtes, in whom Chriſte had triumphed nobly according to the glory of his Goſpel. Neither could they liue to Chriſt, vnleſſe they were readie to be gathered vnto Steeuen into the ſocietie of death. Therfore the care they had to burie the martyr, was vnto them a meditation vnto inuincible conſtancie of profeſſing the faith. Therfore they ſought not in a ſuperfluous matter with an vnaduiſed zeale to prouoke their aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries. Although that generall reaſon which ought alwayes and euerie where to be of force amongſt the godly, was vndoutedly of great weight with them. For the rite of burying doth appertaine vnto the hope of the reſurrection, as it was ordeined by God ſince the beginning of the world to this end.</p>
               <p>Wherefore this was alwayes counted cruell Barbariſme, to ſuffer bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to lie vnburied willingly. Profane men did not know why they ſhuld count the right of buriall ſo holy: but wee are not ignorant of the ende therof: to wit, that thoſe which remaine aliue may know, that the bodies are committed to the earth as to a priſon, vntil they be raiſed vp thence.
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:7788:101" rendition="simple:additions"/> Whereby it appeareth that this duty is profitable rather for thoſe which are aliue, than for thoſe which are deade. Although it is alſo a point of our humanitie, to giue due honour to thoſe bodies to which wee knowe bleſſed immortalitie to be promiſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They made great lamentation.</hi> Luke doth alſo commend their profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of godlineſſe and faith in their lamentation. For a dolefull and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſperous ende cauſeth men for the moſt part to forſake thoſe cauſes wherein they were delighted before. But on the other ſide theſe men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare by their mourning, that they are no what terrified with the death of Stephen, from ſtanding ſtoutly in the approbation of their cauſe: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering therewithal what great loſſe Gods church ſuffered by the death of one man. And we muſt reiect that fooliſh Philoſophie, which willeth me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be altogither blockiſh, that they may be wiſe. It muſt needs be that the Stoicks were void of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon ſenſe, who would haue a man to be with out all affection. Certaine mad fellowes would gladly bring in the ſame dotings into the Church at this day, and yet notwithſtanding although they require an heart of yron of other men, there is nothing ſofter or more effeminate than they. They cannot abide that other men ſhould ſhedde one teare: if any thing fall out otherwiſe than they woulde wiſh, they make no end of mourning. God doth thus puniſh their arrogancy ieſtingly (that I may ſo terme it) ſeing that he ſetteth them to be laught at euen by boyes. But let vs know that thoſe affections which God hath giuen to mans nature, are of themſelues no more corrupt, than the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour himſelfe: but that they are firſt to bee eſteemed according to the cauſe: ſecondly if they keepe a meane and moderation. Surely that man which denieth that wee ought to reioice ouer the giftes of God, is more like a blocke than a man: therefore wee may no leſſe lawfully ſorrowe when they be taken away. And leaſt I paſſe the compaſſe of this preſent place, Paule doeth not altogither forbidde men mourning, when any of their friends is taken away by death, but he would haue a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them and the vnbeleeuers: becauſe hope ought to bee to them a comfort, and a remedie againſt vnpatience. For the beginning of death cauſeth vs to ſorrow for good cauſes: but becauſe we knowe that we haue life reſtored to vs in Chriſt, we haue that which is ſufficient to appeaſe our ſorrowe. In like ſort when wee are ſorie that the Church is depriued of rare and excellent men, there is good cauſe of ſorrow: onely we muſt ſeek ſuch comfort as may correct exceſſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>But Saul.</hi> Wee muſt note two thinges in this place, howe greate the cruelty of the aduerſaries was, and howe wonderfull the goodneſſe of God was, who vouchſafed to make Paul a Paſtour of ſo cruel a wolfe. For that deſire to lay waſt the Church wherewith he was incenſed, did ſeeme to cut away all hope. Therefore his conuerſion was ſo much the more excellent afterward. And it is not to bee doubted but that this pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment was laid vpon him by God, after that he had conſpired to put Stephen to death togither with the other wicked men, that he ſhoulde be the ringleader of crueltie. For God doeth oftentimes puniſh ſinnes more ſharply in the Elect than in the reprobate.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="186" facs="tcp:7788:102"/>4 <hi>And they were ſcattered abroad.</hi> Luke declareth in this place alſo, that it came to paſſe by the wonderful prouidence of God, that the ſcattering abroad of the faithfull, ſhould bring many vnto the vnitie of faith: thus doth the Lord vſe to bring light out of darknes, &amp; life out of death. For the voice of the Goſpel which was heard heretofore in one place onely, doth now ſound euerywhere: in the meane ſeaſon we are taught by this example, that we muſt not yeeld vnto perſecutions: but rather be encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged vnto valiantnes. For when the faithfull flie from Ieruſalem, they are not afterwarde diſcouraged either with exile, or with their preſent miſeries, or with any feare, that they degenerate vnto ſlouthfulnes: but they are as ready to preach Chriſt euen in the midſt of their calamitie, as if they had neuer ſuffered any trouble. Moreouer Luke ſeemeth to note that they leade a wandering life, in that they chaunged their lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings often. Therefore if we deſire to be counted their brethren, let vs pricke forwarde our ſelues ſo diligently, that no feare or bitterneſſe of croſſe diſcourage vs, but that wee goe forward in ſhewing forth the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of faith: and that we neuer be weary of furthering the doctrine of Chriſt. For it is an abſurde thing that exile and flight which are the firſt exerciſes of martyrdome, ſhoulde make vs dumbe and faint-harted.</p>

               <p n="5">5 Luke ſaide that they all preached the word of God, now he maketh mention of Philip alone, both becauſe his preaching was more fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and effectuall than the preaching of the reſt, and alſo becauſe there followed notable hiſtories, which he will adde afterwarde. Hee put the citie of Samaria, for the citie Samaria, which was laide waſte by Hir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canus,

When hee ſaieth that Philip <hi>preached Christ,</hi> hee ſignifieth that the whole ſumme of the Goſpel is contained in Chriſt. The other ſpeach which he vſeth ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie after, is more perfect: yet it is al one in effect. Hee ioyneth the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God and the name of Chriſt togither: but becauſe we obtaine this goodneſſe through Chriſt, to haue God to reigne in vs, and to lead an heauenly life, being renewed into ſpirituall righteouſneſſe, and dead to the worlde, therefore the preaching of Chriſt containeth this point alſo vnder it. But the ſumme is this, that Chriſt doeth repaire with his grace the worlde, being deſtroyed, which commeth to paſſe when hee reconcileth vs to the father: ſecondly when hee regenerateth vs by his ſpirite, that the kingdome of God may be erected in vs, when Sathan is put to flight. Moreouer whereas he declared before, that the Apoſtles did not ſtirre one foote from Ieruſalem, it is to be thought that he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of one of the ſeauen Deacons, in this place, whoſe daughters did alſo prophecie.</p>
               <p n="6">6 <hi>And the multitude gaue eare.</hi> Luke declareth howe the Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans did embrace Philips doctrine. For hee ſaieth that they hearde, whereby they tooke ſome taſte: there was alſo another pricke where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they were pricked forwarde, and that was myracles: at length there followed attentiueneſſe. This is the right going forwarde vnto faith.<note place="margin">Rom. 10.14.</note> For thoſe which refuſe that doctrine which they haue not hearde: howe is it poſſible that they ſhoulde euer come vnto faith, which commeth by hearing? Therefore where as they were readie to heare, that was the firſt ſteppe vnto reuerence and attentiueneſſe. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is no maruel, if faith bee ſo rare and almoſt none in the world: for howe manie bee there which vouchſafe to hearken when God ſpeaketh? Whereby it commeth to paſſe that the more part reiecteth the truth before they knowe the ſame, and haue not ſo much as lightlie taſted it. And as hearing is the beginning of faith: ſo it ſhoulde not be ſufficient of it ſelfe, vnleſſe the maieſtie of doctrine ſhoulde alſo mooue the heartes. And ſurely whoſoeuer conſidereth that he hath to doe with God, cannot heare him contemptuouſly when hee ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth: and the verie doctrine which is contained in his worde, ſhall purchaſe authoritie for it ſelfe: ſo that attentiueneſſe ſhall flowe of it ſelfe from hearing. As touching myracles wee knowe that there is a double vſe thereof: they ſerue to prepare vs to heare the Goſpel: and to confirme vs in the faith thereof. The aduerbe with <hi>one accord,</hi> may be ioyned as wel with hearing, as with attentiueneſſe. This latter doth like mee better, that they were attentiue with one accord. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in doth Luke commend the force and efficacie of Philips preaching, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a great number of men was ſodainly wonne to heare attentiuely with one conſent.</p>

               <p n="11">11 When hee ſaith, that <hi>they were astonyed</hi> from the leaſt to the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt. For ſeeing all men of what eſtate ſo euer they were, were deluded, what entrance coulde the Goſpel haue: eſpecially ſythence it was no meane ſeducing? For all their ſenſes were beſotted. And beſides that we ſee thereby how mightie the truth is, there is alſo ſet before vs an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of conſtancie in Philip: who though he ſee no way, yet doeth hee ſet hand to the Lords worke with a valiant courage, waiting for the ſucceſſe which God ſhould giue. And thus muſt we do, we muſt valiantly attempt whatſoeuer the Lorde commaundeth, euen when our indeuours ſeeme to be vaine. Furthermore whereas Sathan did bewitch the Samaritans: let vs know that it is the common puniſhment of infidelitie. Al men are not bewitched in deede with the iuglings of inchaunters, neither are there Simons euery where, which can ſo ſeduce and deceiue: but my meaning is, that it is no wonder, if Sathan do mocke men diuerſly in the darke. For they are ſubiect to all errors whoſoeuer are not gouerned by the Spirite of God. Furthermore when Luke ſaith that they were all ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced one with another: we are taught that neither wit, neither all that reaſon and wiſedome which we haue, are ſufficient to auoide the crafti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Sathan withall.

                  <hi>The great power of God.</hi> Therefore Sathan abuſed the name of God to deceiue: which is the moſt peſtilent kind of deceiuing, ſo farre is it from being any excuſe.

<pb n="189" facs="tcp:7788:103" rendition="simple:additions"/> and ſurpaſſe whatſoeuer was elſewhere diuine: as the ſunne darkneth all the ſtarres with his light. This was wicked and vngodly prophaning of the name of God. But wee reade of nothing which was done heere, which is not done as yet dayly. For men are bent to nothing more than to tranſlate that to Sathan, which is proper to God. They pretend reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, but what did this pretence helpe the Samaritans? Therefore it goeth well with vs when God ſetteth forth to vs his power in Chriſt, and declareth therewith that we muſt not ſeeke the ſame any where elſe: &amp; doth diſcouer the ſleights and iugling caſts of Satan which wee muſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoid, to the end he may keepe vs ſtill in himſelfe.</p>

For it was meete that they ſhould be engraffed into the body of the church, before they ſhould receiue the ſigne: but the Anabaptiſts are too fooliſh, whiles they endeuour to proue by theſe places, that infants are not to be baptiſed. Men and women could not be baptiſed without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king confeſſion of their faieth: but they were admitted vnto baptiſme vppon this condition, that their families might be conſecrated to God: for the couenant goeth thus: I will bee thy God,<note place="margin">Gen. 17.7.</note> and the God of thy ſeede.</p>
               <p n="13">13 <hi>Simon alſo himſelfe.</hi> Hee which had beſotted the whole citie with his witcherie, receiueth the truth togither with others. Hee which had boaſted himſelfe to be the principall power of God, ſubmitteth himſelfe to God: though he were brought to the knowledge of the Goſpel, not ſo much for his owne ſake alone, as for the whole countries ſake, that that offence might be taken out of the way, which might haue hindred the vnskilfull. And to this end tendeth that which Luke ſetteth downe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, that he wondred at the ſignes. For God meant to triumph ouer this man, whom the Samaritans counted a petit God: which commeth to paſſe whiles he is enforced to giue glorie to the true myracles, after that his vaine boaſting is taken away. And yet he giueth not himſelfe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſyncerely to Chriſt: for then his ambition, and that wicked and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane account which hee made of the gifts of God, ſhould not breake out. And yet I am not of their minde, who thinke that hee made onely a ſemblance of faith, ſeing he did not beleeue. Luke ſaith plainly that hee beleeued, and the reaſon is added, Becauſe hee was touched with won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring. How then doth he ſhortly after bewray himſelfe to be but an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite? I anſwere, That there is ſome meane betweene faith and meere diſſimulation. The Epicures and Lucianiſts doe profeſſe that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, where as notwithſtanding they laugh inwardly, wheras the hope of eternall life is vnto them a vaine thing, finally whereas they haue no more godlineſſe than dogs and ſwine. But there be many, who (howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they be not regenerate with the Spirit of adoption, &amp; do not addict
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:7788:104"/> themſelues vnto God with the true affection of the heart, being ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with the power of the word, do not onely confeſſe that that is true which is taught, but are alſo touched with ſome feare of God, ſo that they receiue doctrine. For they conceiue that God muſt be heard, that hee is both the author and alſo the iudge of the world. Therefore they make no ſemblance of faith before men, which is none, but they thinke that they beleeue. And this faith continueth onely for a time, whereof Chriſt ſpeaketh in Marke:<note place="margin">Mark. 4. Luk. 8.13</note> to wit, when the ſeede of the Worde concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in the minde, is notwithſtanding choked foorthwith with diuerſe cares of the world, or with wicked affections, ſo that it neuer commeth to any ripeneſſe, yea rather it groweth out of kinde vnto vnprofitable corne nothing worth. Such therefore was Simons faith: he perceiueth that the doctrine of the Goſpel is true, and he is inforced to receiue the ſame with the feeling of his conſcience: but the groundwork is wanting: that is, the deniall of himſelfe. Whereupon it followed that his minde was inwrapped in diſſimulation, wihch he vttereth forthwith. But let vs know that his hypocricie was ſuch, as he deceiued himſelfe in: and not that groſſe hypocriſie whereof Epicures and ſuch like make boaſt: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they dare not confeſſe the contempt of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He was baptized.</hi> It appeareth plainely by this example of Simon, that all men haue not that grace giuen them in Baptiſme, which grace is there figured. The opinion of the Papiſtes is this, That, vnleſſe mortall ſinne bee the cauſe of let, all men receiue the truth and effect with the ſignes. So that they attribute vnto the ſacraments magicall force, as if they did profite without faith. But let vs know, that the Lorde offereth to vs by the Sacraments, whatſoeuer the annexed promiſes do ſounde, and that they are not offered in vaine, ſo that being directed vnto Chriſt by faith, wee fette from him whatſoeuer the Sacramentes doe promiſe. And although the receiuing of Baptiſme did profite him nothing then, yet if conuerſion followed afterwarde, as ſome men ſuppoſe, the profite was not extinguiſhed nor aboliſhed. For it commeth to paſſe oftentimes that the Spirit of God worketh afterwarde after long time, that the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments may begin to ſhew forth their force.</p>

And this is a tryall of our patience.<note place="margin">2. Tim. 4.10.</note> So Demas was a companion of Paule for a time, afterwarde he became an vnfaithfull reuolt. Finallie we cannot eſcape this euill, but that wicked men and deceitfull will ſometimes ioyne themſelues vnto vs, and if at any time the wicked creepe craftily into our companie, proude Cenſors burthen vs vniuſtly, as if wee were to anſwere for their miſdeeds. Though we muſt take great heede of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitie, which cauſeth the Goſpel to be ſlaundered oftentimes, and we muſt be ſo much the more vigilant, that wee admit none without great choiſe, foraſmuch as we heare that great men haue bene deceiued. He ſaith that he was made aſtonyed with the greatneſſe of the ſignes: that we may know that that great power, whereof he boaſted, was nothing elſe but iugling and ſmokes.

For we muſt not thinke, that the Apoſtles tooke that counſell whereof Luke ſpeaketh, without the inſtinct of the ſame God, who had already begunne his worke in Samaria by the hand of Philip. And he vſeth his inſtruments diuerſely vnto diuerſe parts of his worke, according to his good pleaſure. He vſed Philip as an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to bring them vnto the faith: nowe he ordaineth Peter and Iohn to be miniſters to giue the ſpirite. And thus doeth he foſter the vnitie of his Church, when one helpeth another: and doeth not onely knitte man and man togither, but whole Churches alſo. Hee coulde haue fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed that which hee had begunne by Philip: but to the ende the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritans might learne to embrace brotherly fellowſhippe with the firſt Church, hee meant to binde them heerewith as with a bande: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condlie hee meant to graunt the Apoſtles (whom hee had commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to preach the Goſpell throughout the whole worlde,<note place="margin">Mark. 6.15.</note>) this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledge, that they might the better all growe togither into one faith of the Goſpel. And we knowe that it was otherwiſe daungerous, leaſt, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Iewes and Samaritans were much vnlike in minde and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, being ſo diuided, they ſhoulde by this meanes diuide Chriſt: or at leaſt feigne to themſelues a newe Church. In the meane ſeaſon wee ſee howe carefull the Apoſtles were to helpe their brethren. For they ſtay not vntill they be requeſted, but they take this charge vppon them of their owne accorde. The Apoſtles doe not this through anie diſtruſt, as if they did ſuſpect that Philip did not his duetie ſo vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightlie as hee ought: but they ſet too their hande to helpe him in his worke: and Peter and Iohn came not onely to helpe him and to be partakers of his labours, but alſo to approue the ſame. Againe Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip is not grieued becauſe other men finiſh that building which hee had begunne, but they one helpe another full gently and faithfullie. And ſurely it is ambition alone which will not ſuffer holie fellowſhippe and mutuall imparting of dueties to enter. Whereas Luke ſaieth that Peter was <hi>ſent</hi> by the reſt: wee may heereby gather that hee was not the chiefe ruler ouer his fellowes in office, but did ſo excell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, that yet notwithſtanding he was ſubiect to, and did obey the bodie.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Which were at Ieruſalem.</hi> This may carry a double meaning, either that al the Apoſtles were at Ieruſalem then, or that there were certaine reſident there, when the reſt went hither and thither. And I doe rather allowe this later: for it is to bee thought that they did ſo deuide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, that alwayes ſome of the number might take vpon them diuerſe ambaſſages, as occaſion was offered: that ſome might ſtay at Ieruſalem, as in the principal ſtanding. Againe it may be, that after euery man had ſpent ſome time in his voyage, they were wont to aſſemble themſelues there. It is certaine in deed that that time which they ſpent at Ieruſalem was not ſpent in idlenes: and ſecondly that they were not tyed to ſome one place,<note place="margin">Mark. 16.15</note> for as much as Chriſt had commaunded them to goe ouer all the world.</p>
               <p n="15">15 <hi>They prayed.</hi> Vndoubtedly they taught firſt: for we know that they were no dombe perſons: but Luke paſſeth ouer that which was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to them and Philip, and declareth onely what newe thing the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritans had by their comming: to wit, that they had the ſpirite giuen them then.</p>
               <p n="16">16 But here ariſeth a queſtion. For hee ſaieth that they were onely baptized into the name of Chriſt, and that therefore they had not as yet receiued the holy Ghoſt. But Baptiſme muſt either be in vaine and with out grace, or elſe it muſt haue all the force which it hath from the holie Ghoſt. In Baptiſme we are waſhed from our ſinnes: but Paule teacheth that our waſhing is the worke of the holy Ghoſt.<note place="margin">Titus 3.5. 1. Pet. 1.2. Rom. 6.6. Gal. 3.27.</note> The water vſed in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme is a ſigne of the bloud of Chriſt: but Peter ſaieth that it is the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, by whom we are waſhed with the blood of Chriſt. Our olde man is crucified in Baptiſme, that wee may be raiſed vp vnto newneſſe of life: and whence commeth all this, ſaue onely from the ſanctification of the Spirite? And finally what ſhall remaine in Baptiſme, if it bee ſeparate from the ſpirite? Therefore we muſt not denie but that the Samaritans who had put on Chriſt in deede in Baptiſme, had alſo his ſpirite giuen them. And ſurely Luke ſpeaketh not in this place of the common grace of the ſpirite, whereby God doth regenerate vs, that we may be his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, but of thoſe ſingular gifts, wherewith God would haue certaine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dewed at the beginning of the Goſpell, to bewtifie Chriſtes kingdome. Thus muſt the words of Iohn be vnderſtoode, that the diſciples had not the ſpirit giuen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as yet, foraſmuch as Chriſt was yet conuerſant in the world: not that they were altogither deſtitute of the ſpirite, ſeeing that they had from the ſame both faith, and a godly deſire to followe Chriſt, but becauſe they were not furniſhed with thoſe excellent giftes, wherein appeared afterward greater glory of Chriſt his kingdome. To conclude, for as much as the Samaritans were alreadie endewed with the ſpirit of adoption, the excellent graces of the ſpirite are heaped vppon them, in which God ſhewed to his Church for a time as it were the viſible pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of his ſpirit, that hee might eſtabliſh for euer the authoritie of his Goſpel, and alſo teſtifie that his ſpirit ſhall be alwayes the gouernor and directer of the faithfull.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They were onely baptized.</hi> We muſt not vnderſtand this as ſpoken con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuouſly
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:7788:105" rendition="simple:additions"/> of Baptiſme: but Luke his meaning is, that they were one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly endewed then with the grace of common adoption &amp; regeneration, which is offered to all the godly in Baptiſme. As for this, it was an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie thing, that certaine ſhoulde haue the giftes of the Spirite giuen them, which might ſerue to ſet foorth the kingdome of Chriſt and the glorie of the Goſpel: for this was the vſe thereof, that euerie one might profite the Church, according to the meaſure of his habili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. We muſt note this therefore, becauſe whiles the Papiſtes will ſet vp their feigned confirmation, they are not afraide to breake out into this ſacilegious ſpeech, that they are but halfe Chriſtians, vpon whom the hands haue not beene as yet laide. This is not tollerable nowe, becauſe whereas this was a ſigne which laſted onely for a time, they made it a continuall law in the Church, as if they had the Spirite in readineſſe to giue to whom ſoeuer they would. Wee knowe that when the teſtimonie and pledge of Gods grace is ſet before vs in vaine and without the thing it ſelfe, it is too filthy mockerie, but euen they themſelues are enforced to graunt, that the Church was bewtified for a time onely with theſe gifts: Whereupon it followeth that the laying on of hands which the Apoſtles vſed, had an end when the effect ceaſed. I omit that,<note place="margin">Mark. 6.13.</note> that they added oyle vnto the laying on of hands: but this, as I haue alreadie ſaid, was a point of too great boldneſſe, to preſcribe a perpetuall lawe to the Church, that that might be a generall ſacrament,<note place="margin">Galat. 3.37. Rom. 6.6.</note> which was peculiarly vſed amongſt the Apoſtles: that the ſigne might continue ſtill after that the thing it ſelfe was ceaſed. And with this they ioyned deteſtable blaſphemie, becauſe they ſaide that ſinnes were onely forgiuen by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme: and that the Spirite of regeneration is giuen by that rotten oile, which they preſumed to bring in without the worde of God. The ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth teſtifie that we put on Chriſt in Baptiſme, and that we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffed into his bodie, that our olde man may be crucified, and we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed into righteouſneſſe. Theſe ſacrilegious robbers haue tranſlated that to adorne the falſe viſure of their ſacrament, which they haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from Baptiſme: neither was this the inuention of one man onely, but the decree of one Councell, whereof they bable daily in all their ſchooles.</p>
               <p n="17">17 <hi>When they had laid their hands.</hi> The laying on of hands followeth prayers, whereby they teſtifie that the grace of the Spirite is not inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the externall ceremonie, which they craue humblie at the hands of another. And yet when they confeſſe that God is the authour, they neglect not the ceremonie which was deliuered them by God to this vſe: and becauſe they vſurpe it not raſhly, the effect is alſo annexed. This is the profite and efficacy of ſignes, becauſe God worketh in them, and yet he remaineth the only giuer of grace, and diſtributeth the ſame according to his good pleaſure: but let vs remember, that the laying on of hands was the inſtrument of God, at ſuch time as he gaue the viſible graces of the Spirit to his, and that ſince that the Church was depriued of ſuch riches, it is onely a vaine viſure without any ſubſtance.</p>

But let vs remember firſt, to the ende we may be free from the infection of Simon, that the gifts of the Spirite are not gotten with money, but that they are giuen of the free and meere goodneſſe of God, and that for the edifying of the Church: that is, that euery man may ſtudie to helpe his brethren according to the meaſure of his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie: that euery man may beſtowe that about the common good of the Church, which he hath receiued: &amp; that the excellencie of no man may hinder, but that Chriſt may excell all. Notwithſtanding it may ſeeme a maruellous matter, that Peter excludeth Simon from being a partaker of the Spirit, as concerning ſpeciall gifts: becauſe his heart is not right before God. For the wickednes of Iudas did not let him from hauing the gifts of the Spirit in great meaſure: neither had the giftes of the ſpirit ben ſo corrupted amongſt the Corinthians, if their heart had beene right in the ſight of God. Therefore that reaſon which Peter al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth, ſeemeth inſufficient: becauſe many men excell oftentimes in the gifts of the ſpirit, who haue an vncleane heart. But firſt of all there followeth no abſurdity, if God giue ſuch graces to men which are vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy thereof. ſecondly Peter preſcribeth no general rule in this place, but becauſe the church alone is for the moſt part made partaker of the gifts of the ſpirit, he pronounceth that Simon who is a ſtraunger to Chriſt, is vnworthy to haue the ſame graces giuen him (which are beſtowed vpon the faithful) as if he were one of Gods houſhold. Moreouer he had blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed thoſe gifts whereof he is depriued.</p>
               <p n="22">22 <hi>Repent therefore.</hi> Whereas he exhorteth him vnto repentance and prayer, hee putteth him in ſome hope of pardon thereby: for no man ſhall euer bee touched with anie deſire of repentance, ſaue onely he which ſhall beleeue that God will haue mercie vppon him: on the other ſide diſpaire will alwayes carrie men headlong vnto boldneſſe. Furthermore the Scripture teacheth that God is not called vppon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, ſaue onely by faith. Therefore wee ſee howe Peter raiſeth vp Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon nowe, vnto hope of ſaluation, whom hee had throwne downe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with the cruell lightnings and thunderbolts of wordes: and yet Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon his ſinne was no ſmall ſinne. But, if it could be, we ought to plucke men euen out of hell. Therefore vntill ſuch time as euen the moſt wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men doe by manifeſt ſignes bewraie themſelues to bee reprobates, no one of them is to bee handled ſo ſharpely, but that remiſſion of ſinnes is to bee ſet before him. Yea wee muſt ſo deale with thoſe for whom ſharpe chiding is profitable by reaſon of their hardneſſe and ſtubberneneſſe, that we throw them downe with one hand, and ſet them on foote with the other. For the Spirit of God doth not ſuffer vs to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſe them. But Peter ſeemeth to bring him into ſome feare and doubt
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:7788:107" rendition="simple:additions"/> when he ſaith <hi>If peraduenture.</hi> And the Papiſts go about to proue by this place and ſuch like, that wee muſt pray with doubtfull mindes: becauſe men may vnaduiſedly promiſe themſelues certaine ſucceſſe in their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions: but we may readily anſwere them. For the word <hi>ei ara</hi> ſignifieth as much as if a man ſhould ſay, If by any meanes thou maiſt obtain par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of God. Peter vſeth this word, not that he may leaue Simons mind in a perplexitie, but that he may the more pricke him forward to bee earneſt in prayer. For the very difficultie doth not a litle ſerue to ſtir vs vp: becauſe when we ſee the thing at hande, wee are too careleſſe and ſluggiſh. Therefore Peter doth not terrifie Simon, that hee may ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw or trouble all hope of obtaining, in his heart, but putting him in ſure hope, if he ſhall craue pardon humblie and from his heart, he tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth him onely that pardon is harde to be gotten, by reaſon of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his offence, to the end hee may prouoke him vnto feruentneſſe. For it is requiſite that we be lightned by faith when we go vnto God, yea that ſhe be the mother of prayer.</p>
               <p n="23">23 <hi>In the gall of bitterneſſe.</hi> Peter doth ſharply reproue Simon againe, and ſtriketh him with Gods iudgement. For vnleſſe he had ben compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to deſcend into himſelfe, he would neuer haue bene turned in good earneſt vnto God. For there is nothing more deadly for men which are blockiſh, than when we flatter them, or when wee doe but a little ſcrape the skinne, whereas they ought rather to be thruſt through. Therefore vntil ſuch time as a ſinner ſhall conceiue ſorrowe and true heauineſſe by reaſon of his ſinne, we muſt vſe ſuch ſeueritie as may wounde his minde: otherwiſe the rotten ſore ſhall be nouriſhed within, which ſhall by little and little conſume the man himſelfe. Yet let vs alwayes obſerue this meane, that we prouide for mens ſaluation, ſo much as in vs lieth. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer there bee two excellent fine metaphors in Peters words: the one whereof ſeemeth to bee taken out of Moſes, where hee forbiddeth that there bee not in vs any roote, from which ſpringeth gal and wormwood. Deut. 29. By which ſpeech is noted the inward wickedneſſe of the hart: when as it hath ſo conceiued the poyſon of vngodlineſſe, that being therewith infected, it can bring foorth nothing but bitterneſſe. To the ſame ende tendeth the binding of iniquitie: to wit, when the whole hart is kept bound and tyed by Satan. For it falleth out ſometimes, that men which are otherwiſe giuen very godlily, do breake out into euill works, who haue not their heart corrupt inwardly with poiſon. We know that hypocriſie is ingendred in mans nature: but when as the Spirit of God doth ſhine, we are not ſo blinded in our vices, that we nouriſh them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in as if it were ſome hidden bundle. Therfore Peter his meaning is, that Simon fel not onely in one point, but that his very heart roote was cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and bitter: that he fell into Satans ſnares not onely in one kinde of ſin, but that al his ſenſes were inſnared, ſo that he was wholly giuen ouer to Satan, and was become the bonde ſlaue of iniquitie. In the meane ſeaſon wee are taught, that the greatnes of offences is eſteemed not ſo much according to the fact which appeareth, as according to the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the heart.</p>

                  <pb n="198" facs="tcp:7788:108" rendition="simple:additions"/>24 <hi>Simon anſwered.</hi> Hereby wee gather, that hee did not ſo take that which Peter had threatned vnto him, but that hee did conſider that his ſaluation was ſought. And though Peter alone ſpake, yet he attributeth the ſpeech, vnto al, by reaſon of the conſent. Now ariſeth a queſtion what we ought to thinke of Simon. The Scripture carrieth vs no farther, ſaue onely vnto a coniecture. Wheras he yeeldeth when he is reproued, and being touched with the feeling of his ſin, feareth the iudgement of god: and that done, flieth vnto the mercie of God, and commendeth himſelf to the prayers of the church: theſe are aſſuredly no ſmal ſignes of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: therefore we may coniect that he repented. And yet the old wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters affirme with one conſent, that he was a great enimie to Peter after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, &amp; that he diſputed with him by the ſpace of three dayes at Rome. The diſputation is alſo extant in writing vnder the name of Clement, but it hath in it ſuch filthy dotings, that it is a wonder that Chriſtian cares can abide to heare them. Again, Auguſtine writing to Iannarius, ſaith, that there were diuerſe and falſe rumors ſpread abroade in Rome in his time, concerning that mater. Wherfore nothing is more ſafe than bidding adue to vncertaine opinions, ſimplie to imbrace that which is ſet downe in the Scriptures. That which we reade elſewhere of Simon, may iuſtly be ſupected for many cauſes.</p>
               <p n="25">25 <hi>And they testified.</hi> In theſe wordes Luke teacheth, that Peter and Iohn came not onely, that they might enrich the Samaritans with the gifts of the Spirite, but alſo that they might eſtabliſh them in the faith which they had already receiued, by approuing Philip his doctrine. For thus much doth the word <hi>testifie</hi> import: as if he ſhuld ſay that it came paſſe by their teſtimony, that the word of God had ful and perfit autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and that the truth was of force, as being well teſtified and authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical. Notwithſtanding Luke teacheth therewithal, that they were faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful witneſſes of God, when he addeth that they vttered the word of god. This was therefore the ſum of the Apoſtles doctrine, faithfully to vtter thoſe things which they had learned of the Lord, and not their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions or the inuentions of any man elſe. He ſaith, that they did this not onely in the cittie, but alſo in villages. Therefore wee ſee that they were ſo inflamed to further the glory of Chriſt, that whither ſoeuer they came, they had him in their mouth. So that the ſeede of life began to be ſowen throughout the whole region, after that it was preached in the Citie.</p>

               <p n="26">26 <hi>And The Angel.</hi> Luke paſſeth ouer vnto a new hiſtorie, to wit, how the goſpel came euen vnto the Aethiopians. For though hee reporteth there was but one man conuerted vnto the faith of Chriſt, yet becauſe his authoritie and power was great in all the realme, his faith might ſpread abroad a ſweet ſmel farre and wide. For we know that the Goſpel grew of ſmall beginnings: and therein appeared the power of the Spirit more plainly, in that one graine of ſeede did fill a whole countrie in a ſmall ſpace. Philip is firſt commaunded by the Angel, to goe towarde the South: the Angel telleth him not to what ende. And thus doeth God oftentimes vſe to deale with thoſe that be his, to proue their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. He ſheweth what he will haue them to doe: he commaundeth them to doe this or that: but he keepeth the ſucceſſe hidden with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. Therefore let vs be content with the commaundement of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, although the reaſon of that which he inioineth, or the fruit of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience appeare not by &amp; by. For although this be not plainly expreſſed, yet al the commandements of God containe an hidden promiſe, that ſo often as we obey him, al that work which we take in hand, muſt needs fal out wel. Moreouer this ought to be ſufficient for vs, that God doth allow our ſtudies, when as we take nothing in hand raſhly or without his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement. If any man obiect that Angels come not downe daily from heauen, to reueale vnto vs what we ought to do: the anſwere is redy: that we are ſufficiently taught in the word of God, what we ought to doe, and that they are neuer deſtitute of counſel, who aske it of him, and ſubmit themſelues to the gouernment of the Spirite. Therefore nothing doeth hinder and keepe vs backe from being ready to follow God, ſaue onely our owne ſlothfulneſſe, and coldneſſe in prayer.</p>

It is true in deede that the Perſians call treaſure or plentie, Gaza: and Luke vſeth this word ſhortly after in this ſenſe, when as he ſaith that the Eunuch was the chiefe gouernor of the treaſure of Candace: but becauſe that Hebrew word was vſed before ſuch time as Cambyſes was borne, I do not think but that it was corrupt afterwarde, the letter <hi>Heth</hi> being chaunged into <hi>G,</hi> which thing wee ſee was done in al other almoſt. The Epitheto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> waſte, is added for this cauſe, becauſe Alexander of Macedonia laid waſte that olde Gaza. Alſo Luke refuteth thoſe who make Conſtantinus the builder of the ſecond &amp; new Gaza, who affirmeth that it was an hundreth and fiftie yeeres before: but it may be that he bewtified and enlarged the citie after it was built.

               <p>
                  <hi>Came to worſhip.</hi> Hereby we gather, that the name of the true God was ſpread farre abroad, ſeeing hee had ſome worſhippers in farre countries. Certes it muſt needs be that this man did openly profeſſe another wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip than his nation: for ſo great a Lorde could not come into Iudea by ſtealth: and vndoubtedly hee brought with him a great traine. And no maruel if there were ſome euery where in the Eaſt parts which worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the true God: becauſe that after the people were ſcattered abroad, there was alſo ſome ſmell of the knowledge of the true God ſpread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad with them throughout forraine countries: yea the baniſhment of the people was a ſpreading abroade of true godlineſſe. Alſo we ſee that though the Romans did condemne the Iewiſh religion with many cruel edicts, yet coulde they not bring to paſſe, but that many euen on heapes would profeſſe the ſame. Theſe were certaine beginnings of the calling of the Gentiles,<note place="margin">Ephe. 2.14.</note> vntill ſuch time as Chriſt hauing with the brightnes of his comming put away the ſhadowes of the Lawe, might take away the difference which was betweene the Iewes and the Gentiles, and hauing pulled downe the wall of ſeparation, he might gather togither from all partes the children of God. Whereas the Eunuch came to Ieruſalem to worſhip, it muſt not be accounted any ſuperſtition, hee might in deede haue called vpon God in his own country: but this man would not omit the exerciſes which were preſcribed to the worſhippers of God: &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this was his purpoſe, not onely to nouriſh faith priuily in his heart, but alſo to make profeſſion of the ſame amongſt men. And yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he could not be ſo diuorced from his nation, but that he might wel know that he ſhould be hated of many: but he made more account of the external profeſſion of religion which he knew God did require, than of the fauor of men. And if ſuch a ſmal ſparkle of the knowledge of the Law, did ſo ſhine in him, what a ſhame were it for vs, to choke the perfit light of the goſpel with vnfaithful ſilence? If any do obiect that the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices were euen then abrogated, &amp; that now the time was come, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:7788:109" rendition="simple:additions"/> God would bee called vppon eueriwhere without difference of place: we may eaſily anſwere, That thoſe to whom the truth of the Goſpel was not yet reuealed, were retained in the ſhadowes of the law without any ſuperſtition. For whereas it is ſaid, that the law was aboliſhed by Chriſt as concerning the ceremonies, it is thus to bee vnderſtoode: that where Chriſt ſheweth himſelfe plainely, thoſe rites vaniſhe away, which prefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured him when he was abſent. Whereas the Lord ſuffered the Eunuch to come to Ieruſalem, before he ſent him a teacher: it is to bee thought that it was done for this cauſe, becauſe it was profitable that he ſhoulde yet be framed by the rudiments of the law, that he might be made more apt afterward to receiue the doctrine of the Goſpel. And whereas God ſent none of the Apoſtles vnto him at Ieruſalem, the cauſe lyeth hid in his ſecrete counſell: vnleſſe peraduenture it were done, that he might make more account of the Goſpel as of ſome treaſure found ſodainly, &amp; offered vnto him contrary to hope: or becauſe it was better that Chriſt ſhould be ſet before him, after that being ſeparated &amp; withdrawen from the external pompe of ceremonies and the beholding of the temple, he ſought the way of ſaluation quietlie at ſuche time as hee was at reſt.</p>
               <p n="28">28 <hi>Hee read Iſaias.</hi> The reading of the Prophet ſheweth that the Eunuch did not worſhip a God vnaduiſedly according to the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of his owne head, whom he had feigned to himſelfe, but whom hee knew by the doctrine of the law. And ſurely this is the right way to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God, not to ſnatch at bare and vaine rites, but to adioyne the word thereunto: otherwiſe there ſhall bee nothing but that which commeth by chaunce and is confuſed. And certainly the fourme of worſhipping preſcribed in the law, differeth nothing from the inuentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of men, ſaue only becauſe God giueth light there by his word. Therfore thoſe which are Gods ſcholers, do worſhippe him aright only, that is, thoſe who are taught in his ſchoole. But hee ſeemeth to looſe his labour when he rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth without profite. For he confeſſeth that he cannot vnderſtande the Prophetes meaning, vnleſſe he be holpen by ſome other teacher. I aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, as he reade the prophet with a deſire to learne, ſo hee hoped for ſome fruite, and he found it indeed. Therefore why doth he denie that he can vnderſtand the place which he had in hand? For becauſe he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly confeſſeth his ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in darker places. There be many things in Iſaias which need no long expoſition: as when hee preacheth of the goodneſſe and power of God, partly that he may inuite men vnto faith, partly that he may exhort and teach them to lead a godly life. Therfore no man ſhall bee ſo rude an idiote, which ſhall not profite ſomewhat by reading that booke, and yet notwithſtanding hee ſhall peraduenture ſcarce vnderſtand euery tenth verſe. Such was the Eunuches reading. For ſeeing that according to his capacitie hee gathered thoſe thinges which ſerued to edification, he had ſome certain profite by his ſtudies. Neuertheleſſe though he were ignorant of many things, yet was he not wearied, ſo that hee did caſt away the booke. Thus muſt wee alſo reade the ſcriptures: we muſt greedily and with a prompt mind receiue thoſe thinges which are plaine and wherein God openeth his minde: as for
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:7788:110" rendition="simple:additions"/> thoſe things which are yet hid fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs, we muſt paſſe them ouer, vntill we ſee greater light. And if we be not wearied with reading, it ſhal at length come to paſſe that the ſcripture ſhalbe made more familiar by continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all vſe.</p>
               <p n="31">31 <hi>How ſhould I.</hi> Moſt excellent modeſtie of the Eunuch, who doeth not only permit Philip, who was one of the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſort to queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with him, but doth alſo willingly confeſſe his ignorance. And ſurely wee muſt neuer hope that he will euer ſhew himſelfe apt to be taught, who is puf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed vp with the confidence of his owne wit. Hereby it commeth to paſſe that the reading of the ſcriptures doth profite ſo few at this day, becauſe we can ſcarſe finde one amongſt an hundreth, which ſubmitteth himſelf willingly to learne. For whiles all men almoſt are aſhamed to bee igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of that whereof they are ignorant: euery man had rather proudlie nouriſh his ignorance, than ſeem to be ſcholer to other men. Yea a great manie take vpon them hautilie to teach other men. Neuertheleſſe let vs remember that the Eunuch did ſo confeſſe his ignorance, that yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding he was one of Gods ſcholers when he read the ſcripture. This is the true reuerence of the ſcripture, when as we acknowledge that there is that wiſdome laid vp there, which ſurpaſſeth all our ſenſes: and yet notwithſtanding we do not loath it, but reading dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly we depend vpon the reuelation of the Spirite, and deſire to haue an interpreter gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He prayed Philip that he would come vp.</hi> This is another token of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtie, that he ſeeketh an interpreter and teacher. Hee might haue reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Philip, according to the pride of riche men: for it was a certaine ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete vpbraiding of ignorance, when Philip ſaid, <hi>vnderſtandest thou</hi> what thou readeſt? But rich men think that they haue great iniurie done the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if any man ſpeake homely to them. And therfore they break out by and by into theſe ſpeeches, What is that to thee? or, What haſt thou to doe with me? But the Eunuch ſubmitteth himſelfe humbly to Philip, that by him he may be taught. Thus muſt we be minded, if we deſire to haue God to bee our teacher, whoſe Spirite reſteth vppon the humble and meek.<note place="margin">Iſa. 66.2.</note> And if any man miſtruſting himſelfe, ſubmit himſelf to be taught, the angels ſhall rather come downe from heauen, than the Lorde will ſuffer vs to labour in vaine. Though (as did the Eunuch) we muſt vſe all helpes, which the Lorde offereth vnto vs, for the vnderſtanding of the ſcriptures. Frantike men require inſpirations and reuelations from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and in the meane ſeaſon they contemne the miniſter of GOD, by whoſe hand they ought to bee gouerned. Otherſome which truſt too much to their owne wit, will vouchſafe to heare no man, and they will read no commentaries. But God will not haue vs to deſpiſe thoſe helps which he offereth vnto vs, and hee ſuffereth not thoſe to ſcape ſcotfree, which deſpiſe the ſame. And here we muſt remember, that the ſcripture is not only giuen vs, but that interpreters and teachers, are alſo added to be helpes to vs. For this cauſe the Lorde ſent rather Philip than an Angell to the Eunuch. For to what ende ſerued this circuit, that God calleth Philip by the voice of the Angell, and ſendeth not the Angell
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:7788:110" rendition="simple:additions"/> himſelfe foorthwith, ſaue only becauſe he would accuſtome vs to heare men?

               <p n="32">32 <hi>The ſentence of ſcripture.</hi> It is properly a text or <hi>period.</hi> Let vs know that he light not vppon this place by chaunce, but that it came to paſſe by the wonderfull prouidence of God, that Philip ſhoulde haue a propoſition or principle, from which the whole ſumme of Chriſtianitie might be ſet. Therefore firſt he hath matter of full inſtruction brought to his hand by the ſecret direction of the Spirite: ſecondly, the fourme is plainely applied to the miniſterie of man. This is an excellent propheſie of Chriſt, and aboue all others to bee remembred: becauſe Iſaias ſaieth plainly there, that ſuch ſhould be the maner of redeeming the churche, that the ſonne of God doe by his death purchaſe life for men: that he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer himſelf in ſacrifice to purge mens ſinnes: that hee bee puniſhed with the hand of God, &amp; that he goe downe euen vnto the very hell, that hee may exalt vs vnto heauen, hauing deliuered vs from deſtruction. In ſum, this place teacheth plainely how men are reconciled to God, howe they obtaine righteouſneſſe, how they come to the kingdome of God, being deliuered from the tyrannie of Satan, and looſed from the yoke of ſinne: to be briefe, whence they muſt fet all partes of their ſaluation. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding I will only expound thoſe things which Luke here citeth, and there be in deed two members: in the former hee teacheth that Chriſte to the end he may redeem the church, muſt needes be ſo broken that he appeare like to a man which is caſt downe &amp; paſt hope. Secondly hee af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth that his death ſhal giue life, &amp; that there ſhal a ſingular triumph iſſue out of great deſpayre. Wheras he compareth Chriſte to a lambe, which ſuffereth it ſelfe to be led to be ſlaine: and to a ſheepe which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth herſelf meekely to be ſhorne: his meaning is, that the ſacrifice of Chriſte ſhalbe voluntarie. And ſurely this was the way to appeaſe Gods wrath, in that he ſhewed himſelfe obedient. Hee ſpake in deede before Pilate: but not to ſaue his life,<note place="margin">Iohn. 18.34.36.</note> but rather that hee might willingly offer himſelfe to die, as hee was appointed by the Father, and ſo might bring that puniſhment vpon himſelf, which was prepared for vs. Therfore the prophet teacheth both things, that Chriſt muſt needs haue ſuffred, that
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:7788:111"/> he might purchaſe life for vs: and that hee was to ſuffer death willingly, that he might blot out the ſtubbornneſſe of men by his obedience. And hence muſt we gather an exhortation vnto godlines, as Peter doeth, but that doctrine of faith which I haue already touched, is former in order.</p>
               <p n="33">33 <hi>In his humilitie, his iudgement.</hi> The Eunuche had either the Greeke volume, or els Luke did ſet downe the reading which was then vſed, as he vſeth to doe. The prophet ſaith that Chriſte was exalted out of ſorrow and iudgement, by which wordes he ſignifieth a wonderfull vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie, which immediately enſued his caſting downe. For if he had been oppreſſed with death, there could nothing haue beene hoped for at his handes.</p>
               <p>Therefore to the end the Prophet may eſtabliſh our faith in Chriſte, after that he had deſcribed him to be ſtriken with the hand of God, and to be ſubiect to be ſlaine, he putteth vpon him a new perſon now to wit, that he commeth vp out of the depth of death as a conqueror, &amp; our of the very hell, being the authour of eternal life. I know in deed that this place is diuerſly expounded: ſome there bee which vnderſtande by this, that he was carried from the priſon to the croſſe: other ſome there bee, who thinke that to <hi>be taken away,</hi> doth ſignifie as much, as to be brought to nought. And indeed the ſignification of the Hebrew word <hi>Lacham,</hi> is doubtfull, as is alſo the ſignification of the Greeke worde <hi>Airesthai.</hi> But he which ſhall throughly weigh the Text, ſhall agree with mee in that which I haue ſaid: that he paſſeth now from that dolefull and vnſeemely ſight which he had ſet before our eies, vnto the new beginning of vnloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for glory. Therefore the Greeke interpretation differeth not much from the words of the prophet, in the ſumme of the matter. For Chriſts iudgement was exalted in his humilitie, or caſting down: becauſe at ſuch time as he might ſeeme to be caſt down and oppreſſed, the father main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained his cauſe. After this ſort <hi>iudgement</hi> ſhall be taken in this place (as in many other) for <hi>right.</hi> But it ſignifieth condemnation in the Hebrew text. For the Prophet ſaith, that after that Chriſt ſhall bee brought into great ſtraites, and ſhalbe like vnto a condemned and loſt man, he ſhalbe lifted vp by the hand of the Father. Therfore the meaning of the words is, that Chriſt muſt firſt haue ſuffered death, before the Father ſhoulde exalt him vnto the glory of his kingdom. Which doctrine muſt be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated vnto the whole bodie of the church: becauſe all the godly ought wonderfully to be lifted vp with the hand of God, that they be not ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed vppe of death. But when God appeareth to bee the reuenger of his, he doth not only reſtore them to life, but alſo getteth to them excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent triumphes of many deathes: as Chriſt did triumph moſt gloriouſly vpon the croſſe, wherof the apoſtle maketh mention in the ſecond chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Colloſſians.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>His generation.</hi> After that the prophet hath ſet forth the victorious death of Chriſte, he addeth now, that his victorie ſhall not laſt onely for a ſmall time, but ſhall goe beyonde all number of yeeres. For the excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the prophet importeth as much, as if he ſhould deny that the perpetuitie of Chriſts kingdom can be expreſſed by the tongue of men.
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:7788:111"/> But interpreters haue wreſted this place miſerably. Whereas the olde writers haue indeuoured hereby to proue the eternal generation of the worde of God againſt Arrius, it is too far diſſenting from the prophetes mind Chryſoſtome his expoſition is neuer a whit truer, who referreth it vnto the humane generation. Neither doe they vnderſtand the prophet his meaning, which ſuppoſe that he inueigheth againſt the men of that age. Otherſome thinke better, who take it to be ſpoken of the Churche, ſaue onely that they are deceiued in the worde <hi>generation,</hi> which they think doth ſignifie a poſteritie or iſſue. But the worde <hi>dor</hi> which the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet vſeth, ſignifieth amongſt the Hebrewes <hi>an age,</hi> or the continuance of mans life. Therefore vndoubtedly this is the prophets meaning, that Chriſt his life ſhall endure for euer, when as he ſhall bee once deliuered by his fathers grace from death: although this life which is without end, appertaineth vnto the whole body of the church: becauſe Chriſt roſe, not that he may liue for himſelfe, but for vs. Therefore he extolleth now in the members, the frute and effect of that victorie which he placed in the head. Wherefore euery one of the faithfull may conceiue ſure hope of eternal life out of this place: ſecondly the perpetuitie of the church is rather auouched in the perſon of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Becauſe his life is taken from the earth.</hi> This is to looke too, to be a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie abſurd reaſon, that Chriſt doth reigne with ſuch renowme in heauen and earth, becauſe he was cut off. For who can beleeue that death is the cauſe of life? But this was done by the wonderfull counſel of God, that hell ſhould be a ladder, whereby Chriſt ſhould aſcend into heauen: that reproch ſhuld be vnto him a paſſage into life: that the ioyfull brightnes of ſaluation ſhould appeare out of the horror and darknes of the croſſe: that bleſſed immortalitie ſhuld flow from the deep pit of death. Becauſe he humbled himſelfe, therefore the Father exalted him,<note place="margin">Phil. 2.10.</note> that euery knee may bow before him, &amp;c. Now muſt we bethinke our ſelues what fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip we haue with Chriſt, that it may not bee troubleſome to any to goe the ſame way.</p>
               <p n="34">34 <hi>The Eunuch ſaid to Philip.</hi> Heere it appeareth what an earneſt deſire the Eunuch had to learne. He wandereth in diuers propheſies of Eſaias as through doubtful boughts, and yet he is not wearie of reading. And whiles that he arrogateth nothing to himſelfe, he getteth far more contrary to his hope euen at a ſodaine, than hee coulde get during his whole life by taking great paines, if he had brought all his quickneſſe of wit. So the Lorde will bee vnto vs a maſter though wee bee but ſmall, if acknowledging our ignorance, wee bee not loth to ſubmit our ſelues to learne. And as the ſeed couered with earth, lyeth hid for a time ſo the Lord will illuminate vs by his Spirite, and will cauſe that reading which being barren and voide of frute, cauſeth nothing but weariſomneſſe, to haue plaine light of vnderſtanding. The Lord doth neuer keep the eyes of his ſo ſhut, but that ſo ſoone as they are once entred, the way of ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion appeareth vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the ſcripture: but that they profite euer now and then a little by reading: yet doth he ſuffer them to ſticke faſt often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and permitteth their courſe to be hindered, by ſome barre which
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:7788:112"/> is laid in the way, both that he may trie patience of faith in them, and alſo that he may teach them humilitie by putting them in mind of their ignorance, that he may make them more attentiue after that they haue ſhaken off drowſines, that hee may make them more feruent in prayer, that he may pricke them forward to loue the truth more dearely, that he may ſet foorth the excellencie of his heauenly wiſdome, which is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe not ſo eſteemed as it ought. But howſoeuer the faithfull do not attaine vnto the mark of perfect knowledge, yet they ſhall alwayes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue that their labour is not in vaine, ſo that they ſtop not the way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore themſelues with proud loathſomneſſe. Let this going forwarde ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice vs vntill the time of full reuelation do come, that euen a ſmall taſte of knowledge doth drip into vs the feare of God and faith.</p>
               <p n="35">35 <hi>Philip opening his mouth.</hi> To open the mouth, is taken in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for to begin a long ſpeech concerning ſome graue &amp; weightie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Therfore Luke his meaning is, that Philip bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to intreat of Chriſt, as it were with ful mouth. He ſaith that he began with this propheſie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is no one which depainteth out Chriſt more liuely: &amp; it was then brought to his hand. Therfore after that Philip had ſhewed by the prophetes wordes, after what ſort Chriſt ſhould come, and what was to be hoped for at his hands, he conferred the thing it ſelfe afterward, that the Eunuch might know that that Chriſt which was promiſed, was alre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die reuealed and giuen: and that he might vnderſtand his power. Wher we tranſlate it, that <hi>he preached Chriſte.</hi> Luke ſaith, that hee preached the Goſpell. The ſenſe is, that he taught that of Chriſt which hee vttered in his goſpel himſelfe, and commaunded to be taught. Wherby we gather, that when Chriſt is knowen, we haue the ſumme of the Goſpel.</p>

                     <hi>39</hi> And when they were come vp out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, and the Eunuch ſawe him no more. Therefore he went on in his way reioyſing.</p>
                  <p n="40">
                     <hi>40</hi> But Philip was found at Azotus: and going on his iourney, hee preached the goſpel to all cities, vntill he came to Ceſaria.</p>
               </q>
               <p n="36">36 <hi>What letteth me?</hi> The Eunuch his baptiſme enſueth now, whence we gather, how greatly he profited in a ſmall time, ſeeing he offereth himſelfe willingly to giue Chriſt his name. For it muſt needes bee that faith was after a ſort ripe in his heart, ſeeing that hee brake out into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall profeſſion with ſuch deſire. I like not that which Chryſoſtom no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, that hee was kept backe with modeſtie from requiring baptiſme plainely: for that interrogation hath greater vehemencie than if hee ſhould ſimply haue ſaid to Philip, I will haue thee to baptize me. But we
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:7788:112"/> ſee that Chriſt was preached to him in ſuch ſort, that he knew that bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme was a ſigne of new life in him, &amp; that therefore he would not neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the ſame, becauſe it was added to the worde, &amp; ſuche an addition as was inſeparable. Therfore as he embraced that willingly, which he hard concerning Chriſt, ſo now hee breaketh out with a godly zeale into the externall confeſſion of faith, neither doth he thinke it ſufficient for him to beleeue inwardly before God, vnleſſe he teſtifie before men that hee is a chriſtian. Ther might many things haue come into his mind, which might haue kept him back from being baptized, leaſt that he ſhould lay himſelf open to the hatred and rebukes both of the queene, and alſo of the whole nation. But he denieth that any of theſe thinges doth hinder him from deſiring to be numbred amongeſt the diſciples of Chriſte. If being inſtructed but a few houres he came to this point, how filthy is the ſluggiſhnes of thoſe men, who ſuppreſſe the faith which they haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, hauing been taught fiue, ten, or twentie yeeres.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If thou beleeueſt with all thy heart.</hi> Wheras the Eunuch is not admitted to Baptiſm, vntil he haue made confeſſion of his faith: we muſt fet a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall rule hence. That thoſe ought to be receiued into the church, who were eſtraunged fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſame before, vntill they haue teſtified that they beleeue in Chriſt. For baptiſme is as it were an appertenance of faith: &amp; therefore it is later in order. Secondly, if it be giuen without faith, whoſe ſeale it is, it is both a wicked and alſo too groſſe a profaning. But fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike fellowes doe both vnskilfully &amp; alſo wickedly impugne baptizing of infants vnder colour hereof, why was it meet that faith ſhould go before baptiſme in the Eunuch? To wit, becauſe ſeeing that Chriſte marketh thoſe alone which are of the houſhold of the church with this note and mark, they muſt be ingraffed vnto the church, who are to bee baptized. And as it is certain that thoſe who are growen vp, are ingraffed by faith, ſo I ſay that the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the godly are born the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the church, and that they are accounted members of Chriſt fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the womb, becauſe God adopteth vs vpon this condition, that he may be alſo the Father of our ſeed. Therfore thogh faith be requiſite in thoſe which are grown vp, yet this is vntruly tranſlated vnto infants, whoſe eſtate is far vnlike. But certain great men haue abuſed this place, when as they wold proue, that faith hath no confirmation by baptiſme: for they reaſoned thus: the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch is commanded to bring perfect faith vnto baptiſme: therfore there could nothing be added. But the ſcripture taketh the whole heart ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for a ſincere &amp; vnfeigned heart, whoſe oppoſite is a double heart. So that there is no cauſe why we ſhould imagine that they beleeue per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, who beleeue with the whole heart ſeing that there may be a weak &amp; faint faith in him, who ſhal notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding haue a ſound minde, and a mind free fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all hyporciſie. Thus muſt we take that which Dauid ſaith, that he loueth the Lord with all his heart. Philip had in deede baptized the Samaritans before, &amp; yet hee knewe that they were yet far from the mark. Therfore the faith of the whole heart, is that which hauing liuing rootes in the heart, doth yet notwithſtanding deſire to encreaſe daylie.</p>

<pb n="208" facs="tcp:7788:113" rendition="simple:additions"/> as the truth and force thereof is contained there: ſo the Eunuch ſetteth Chriſt alone before his eyes. The Eunuch knewe before that there was one God, who had made the couenant with Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who gaue the Law by the hand of Moſes, which ſeparated one people from the other nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, who promiſed Chriſt, through whom hee would be mercifull to the world: now he confeſſeth that <hi>Ieſus</hi> Chriſt is that redeemer of the world and <hi>the ſonne of god:</hi> vnder which title he comprehendeth briefly, al thoſe thinges which the ſcripture attributeth to Chriſt. This is the perfect faith, whereof Philip ſpake of late, which receiueth Chriſte, both as hee was promiſed in times paſt, &amp; alſo ſhewed at le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth, &amp; that with the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt affection of the heart, as Paul will not haue this faith to be feigned. Whoſoeuer hath not this when he is growne vp, in vaine doth hee boaſt of the baptiſme of his infancie: for to this end doth Chriſt admit infants by baptiſme, that ſo ſoone as the capacitie of their age ſhall ſuffer, they may addict themſelues to be his diſciples, and that beeing baptiſed with the holy ghoſt, they may comprehend with the vnderſtanding of faith, his power, which baptiſme doth prefigure.</p>
               <p n="38">38 <hi>They went downe into the water.</hi> Here wee ſee the rite vſed among the men of old time in baptiſme: for they put all the bodie into the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: now the vſe is this, that the miniſter doth only ſprinkle the bodie or the head. But we ought not to ſtand ſo much about ſuch a ſmal differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of a ceremonie, that we ſhould therefore diuide the churche, or trouble the ſame with brawles. We ought rather to fight euen an hundred times to death for the ceremonie it ſelfe of baptiſme, in as much as it was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered vs by Chriſt, than that we ſhoulde ſuffer the ſame to bee taken fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs. But foraſmuch as we haue as well a teſtimonie of our waſhing, as of newneſſe of life, in the ſigne of water, foraſmuch as Chriſte repreſenteth vnto vs his blood in the water as in a glaſſe, that we may fet our cleane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe thence: foraſmuch as he teacheth that we are faſhioned againe by his Spirite, that being dead to ſinne, we may liue to righteouſneſſe: it is certain that we want nothing which maketh to the ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of baptiſm. Wherefore the churche did graunt libertie to her ſelfe ſince the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, to change the rites ſomewhat, excepting this ſubſtance. For ſome dipped them thriſe, ſome but once: wherefore there is no cauſe why wee ſhoulde bee ſo ſtrait laced in matters which are of no ſuche weight: ſo that that externall pompe doe no whit pollute the ſimple inſtitution of Chriſte.</p>
               <p n="39">39 <hi>When they were come vp.</hi> To the ende Luke may at length con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude his ſpeech co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the Eunuch, he ſaith that Philip was caught away out of his ſight: and that was of no ſmall weight to confirme him, foraſmuch as he ſaw, that that man was ſent vnto him by God, like to an Angell, and that he vaniſhed away before he could offer him any reward for his paines: whence he might gather that it was no gainefull inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, ſeeing that he was vaniſhed away before he had one halfe pennie giuen him. Whereas Philip had no rewarde at the Eunuches hande, let the ſeruauntes of Chriſt learne heereby to ſerue him freely, or rather let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo ſerue men for nothing, that they hope for a rewarde fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heauen.

                     <hi>4</hi> And falling flat to the ground, he heard a voice, ſaying to him, Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me?</p>

               <p n="1">1 <hi>And Saul.</hi> Luke ſetteth downe in this place a noble hiſtorie, and
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:7788:114"/> a hiſtorie ful wel worthie to be reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred, concerning the conuerſion of Paul, after what ſort the Lorde did not only bring him vnder, and make him ſubiect to his commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, when he raged like an vntamed beaſt, but alſo how he made him another &amp; a newe man. But becauſe Luke ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth down all things in order, as in a famous work of God, it ſhalbe more conuenient to follow his text, that all that may come in order whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer is worth the noting. When as he ſaieth, that <hi>he breathed</hi> out threate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings &amp; ſlaughter as yet, his meaning is. that after that his handes were once imbrued with innocent blood, he proceeded in like crueltie, &amp; was alwayes a furious &amp; blooddie enemie to the church, after that hee had once made that entrance, wherof mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is made in the death of Stee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. For which cauſe it was the more incredible that he could bee ſo ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly tamed. And whereas ſuch a cruell wolf was not only turned into a ſheepe, but did alſo put on the nature of a ſheephearde: the wonderfull hand of God did ſhew it ſelf therein manifeſtly.</p>
               <p n="2">2 And Luke deſcribeth therwithal, that he was furniſhed with wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons and power to doe hurt, when as he ſaith, that he had obtained let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the higheſt prieſt, that he might bring all thoſe bound to Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, whom he ſhould finde profeſſing the name of Chriſt. There is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made of women, that it may the better appear how deſirous he was to ſhed blood, who had no reſpect of ſexe, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euen armed enemies are wont to ſpare in the heat of warre. Therfore he ſetteth forth before vs a fierce and cruell beaſt, who had not only libertie giuen him to rage, but had alſo his power encreaſed to deuoure and deſtroy godly men, as if a mad man had had a ſword put into his hand. Wheras I haue tranſlated it <hi>Sect,</hi> Luke hath <hi>Way,</hi> which metaphor is common enough in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Therfore Paul his purpoſe was quite to put out the name of Chriſt by deſtroying all the godly cruelly.</p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>As he was in the way.</hi> In crauing Epiſtles of the high prieſt, hee ran headlong againſt Chriſt willingly: and nowe hee is enforced to obey whether he will or no. This is ſurely the moſt excellent mercy of god, in that that man is reclaimed vnto ſaluation contrarie to the purpoſe of his minde, whom ſo great a heat caried headlong into deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Lord ſuffreth him to receiue letters, and to come neere to the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: hereby we ſee how well he knoweth the very inſtants of times to doe euery thing in due time. Hee could haue preuented him ſooner, if it had ſeemed good to him ſo to doe, that he might deliuer the godly from fear and carefulneſſe: but hee ſetteth out his benefites more thereby, in that he tyeth the iawes of the greedie wolfe, euen when he was readie to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſheepfolde. Alſo wee knowe that mens ſtubborneſſe encreaſeth more and more by going forward: wherefore the conuerſion of Paul was ſo much the harder, foraſmuch as he was alreadie made more obſtinate, by continuing his furie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Shined about him.</hi> Becauſe it was none eaſie matter to pull downe ſo great pride, to breake ſuch a loftie courage, to pacifie ſuch a blinde heate of wicked zeale, and finally to bridle a moſt vnbrideled beaſt: Chriſte muſt needs haue ſhewed ſome ſigne of his maieſtie, whereby Paul might
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:7788:114"/> perceiue that he had to do with god himſelf, &amp; not with any mortal ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Although there were ſome reſpect had of humbling him, becauſe he was vnworthie to haue Chriſt to accuſtome him by and by to obey, by laying vpon his necke the meek and ſweete yoke of his Spirite, &amp; he was ſcarce capable of ſo great gentleneſſe, vntil his crueltie might be broken. Mans ſenſe cannot comprehend the diuine glory of Chriſt, as it is, but as God did oftentimes put vpon him formes wherein hee did ſhewe himſelfe: ſo Chriſt did now declare and make manifeſt his diuinitie to Paule, &amp; ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed ſome token of his preſence, that hee might thereby terrifie Paule. For although the godly be afraide and tremble at the ſeeing of God, yet it muſt needes be that Paul was farre more afraid, when as he perceiued that the diuine power of Chriſt was ſet full againſt him.</p>
               <p n="4">4 And therefore Luke ſaith that he fell to the ground. For what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing can befall man, but that he muſt lie proſtrate, and bee as it were brought to nothing, when he is ouerwhelmed with the preſent fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Gods glory? And this was the firſt beginning of the bringing downe of Paul, that hee might become apt to heare the voice of Chriſt, which he had deſpiſed ſo long as he ſate hautily vpon his horſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Saul, Saul.</hi> Luke compared the light which ſhined round about Paul, to lightning, though I doe not doubt but that lightninges did flie in the ayre. And this voice which Chriſt did ſend out to beat downe his pride, may ful well be called <hi>a lightning or thunderbolt,</hi> becauſe it did not onely ſtrike him, and make him aſtonied, but did quite kill him, ſo that hee was now as no bodie with himſelfe, who did ſo much pleaſe himſelfe before, and did challenge to him ſelfe authoritie to put the Goſpell to flight. Luke putteth downe his name in Hebrewe in this place, Saul, Saul, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he repeateth the wordes of Chriſte, who ſpake vnto him vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly according to the common cuſtome of the countrie.</p>
               <p n="5">5 <hi>Who art thou, Lord?</hi> We haue Paul now ſomewhat tamed, but he is not yet Chriſtes diſciple. Pride is corrected in him, and his furie is brought downe, but he is not yet ſo throughly healed, that hee obeyeth Chriſt: he is only readie to receiue commaundements, who was before a blaſphemer. Therefore this is the queſtion of a man that is afraid, and throwne downe with amazedneſſe. For why doeth hee not knowe by ſo many ſignes of Gods preſence, that it is God that ſpeaketh? Therefore that voice proceeded from a panting and doubtfull minde: therefore Chriſt driueth him nigher vnto repentance. When he addeth, <hi>I am Ieſus,</hi> let vs remember, that that voice ſounded from heauen, therfore it ought to haue pearced the mind of Paul, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he conſidered that he had made warre againſt God hitherto: it ought to haue brought him by and by to true ſubmiſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, when he conſidered that he ſhould not eſcape ſcotfree, if he ſhould continue rebellious againſt him, whoſe hand he could not eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape. This place conteineth a moſt profitable doctrine: and the profite thereof is manifolde. For firſt Chriſte ſheweth what great account hee maketh of his Goſpell, when hee pronounceth that it is his cauſe, from which he will not be ſeparated.</p>
               <pb n="212" facs="tcp:7788:115" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>Therefore he can no more refuſe to defend the ſame, than he can deny himſelf. Secondly, the godly may gather great comfort by this, in that they heare that the ſonne of god is partner with them of the croſſe, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as they ſuffer &amp; labour for the teſtimonie of the Goſpell, &amp; that he doth as it were put vnder his ſhoulders, that he may beare ſome part of the burden. For it is not for nothing that he ſaith, that he ſuffreth in our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but he will haue vs to be aſſuredly perſwaded of this, that he ſuffreth together with vs, as if the enemies of the goſpel ſhoulde wounde vs tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row his ſide. Wherefore Paul ſaith, that that is wanting in the ſufferings of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Col. 1.24.</note> what perſecutions ſoeuer the faithful ſuffer at this day for the defence of the Goſpel. Furthermore this conſolation tendeth not onely to that end, to comfort vs, that it may not be troubleſome to vs to ſuffer with our head, but that we may hope that hee will reuenge our miſeries, who crieth out of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that, Al that which we ſuffer, is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to him as well as to vs. Laſtly, we gather heereby what horrible iudgement is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the perſecutors of the Church, who like Giants beſiege the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry heauen, &amp; ſhake their darts which ſhall pearce their own head by and by. Yea by troubling the heauens they prouoke the thu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derbolt of Gods wrath againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues. Alſo we are all taught generally, that no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> run againſt Chriſt, by hurting his brother vniuſtly: &amp; ſpecially that no man reſiſt the truth raſhly, &amp; with a blinde madneſſe vnder colour of zeale.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is hard for thee.</hi> This is a prouerbiall ſentence, taken from oxen or horſes, which when they are pricked with goads, doe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues no good by kicking, ſaue onely that they double the euill by cauſing the pricke to goe farther into their skinnes. Chriſt applieth this ſimilitude vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe very fitly: becauſe men ſhall bring vppon themſelues a double euil, by ſtriuing againſt him, who muſt of neceſſitie bee ſubiect to his will and pleaſure will they, nill they. Thoſe which ſubmit themſelues willingly to Chriſt, are ſo far from feeling any pricking at his hands, that they haue in him a readie remedie for all wounds: but all the wicked who indeuour to caſt out their poyſoned ſtinges againſt him, ſhall at length perceiue that they are Aſſes, and Oxen ſubiect to the pricke. So that hee is vnto the godly a foundation whereon they reſt, but vnto the reprobate who ſtumble at him, a ſtone, which with his hardneſſe grindeth them to pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. And although we ſpeake here of the enemies of the goſpel, yet this admonition may reach farther: to wit, that we do not think that we ſhall get any thing by biting the bridle ſo often as wee haue any thing to doe with god: but that being like to gentle horſes, we ſuffer our ſelues meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be turned about and guided by his hand: and if hee ſpurre vs at any time, let vs bee made more readie to obey by his pricks: leaſt that befall vs which is ſaide in the Pſalme: that the iawes of vntamed Horſes and Mules are tyed and kept in with an harde bit, leaſt they leape vppon vs, &amp;c. In this hiſtorie wee haue an vniuerſall figure of that Grace which the Lorde ſheweth foorth daylie in calling vs all. All men doe not ſet the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues ſo violently againſt the goſpel: yet neuertheleſſe both pride &amp; alſo rebellion againſt God are naturally ingendred in all men: we are all wicked &amp; cruel naturally: therfore in that we are turned to god, that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:7788:115" rendition="simple:additions"/> to paſſe by the wonderfull &amp; ſecret power of God contrary to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The papiſts alſo aſcribe the prayſe of our turning vnto God, to the grace of God, yet only in part: becauſe they imagine that wee worke to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. But when as the Lord doth mortifie our fleſh, he ſubdueth vs, &amp; bringeth vs vnder, as he did Paul: neither is our wil one haire readier to obey, than was Paules, vntil ſuch time as the pride of our heart be bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten downe, and he haue made vs not only flexible, but alſo willing to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey and follow. Therefore ſuch is the beginning of our conuerſion, that the Lord ſeeketh vs of his owne accord when we wander and go aſtray, though hee bee not called and ſought: that hee changeth the ſtubborne affections of our hart, to the end he may haue vs to be apt to be taught. Furthermore, this hiſtorie is of great importaunce to confirme Paule his doctrine. If Paule had alwayes been one of Chriſtes diſciples, wicked and froward men might extenuate the weight of the teſtimonie, which he giueth of his maſter. If he ſhould haue ſhewed himſelfe to be eaſie to be intreated, and gentle at the firſt, we ſhuld ſee nothing but that which is proper to man: but when as a deadly enemie to Chriſte, rebellious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the goſpel, puffed vp with the confidence which he repoſed in his wiſdom, inflamed with hatred of the true faith, blinded with hypocriſie, wholy ſet vpon the ouerthrowing of the truth, is ſodainly changed into a new man, after an vnwonted maner: and of a wolfe, is not only turned into a ſheep, but doth alſo take to himſelfe a ſheepheards nature: it is as if Chriſt ſhould bring foorth with his hande ſome Angel ſent from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. For we doe not nowe ſee that Saul of Tarſus: but a newe man fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the Spirite of God: ſo that hee ſpeaketh by his mouth now as it were from heauen.</p>

                     <hi>6</hi> And he trembling and fearing ſaid: Lord, what wilt thou haue me to do? And the Lorde ſaid vnto him: Ariſe, and goe into the citie, where it ſhalbe told thee, what thou muſt doe.</p>

               <p n="6">6 The frute of that reprehenſion followeth, wherwith we haue ſaid it was requiſite that Paule ſhould haue been ſore ſhaken, that his hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe might be broken for now he offereth himſelf as readie to do what ſoeuer he ſhould command him, whom of late he deſpiſed.

But as God humbled Paul, ſo he wrought effectually in his hart. For it came not to paſſe by any good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of nature, that Paule did more willingly ſubmit himſelfe to God,<note place="margin">Exod. 7.13.</note>
                  <pb n="214" facs="tcp:7788:116" rendition="simple:additions"/> than Pharao: but bicauſe (beeing like to an anuil) did with his hardnes beate back the whips of God wherewith he was to be brought vnder, (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as it had bin the ſtrokes of a hammer): but the heart af Paul was ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainely made a fleſhie heart of a ſtonie heart, after that it receiued ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes from the Spirit of God, which ſoftnes it had not naturally. The ſame thing do we alſo trie daily in our ſelues he reproueth vs by his word, hee threatneth, &amp; terrifieth vs, he addeth alſo light correction, &amp; prepareth vs diuers waies vnto ſubiection: but al theſe helpes ſhall neuer cauſe any man to bring foorth good frute, vnleſſe the Spirit of God do mollifie his heart within.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the Lord ſaid vnto him.</hi> After that Paul had put his ſtiffe neck vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the yoke of Chriſt, he is now gouerned by his hand. For doubtles the Lord doth not ſo bring vs into the way, that he leaueth vs either before we begin our courſe, or in the midſt thereof: but he bringeth vs vnto the very mark by litle &amp; little. Luke depainteth out vnto vs in this place this continuall courſe of gods gouernance: for he taketh him afterward vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himſelf to be taught, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he hath made apt to be taught, neither doth that any whit hinder that he vſeth mans miniſtery in this point: becauſe the authoritie &amp; power remaineth neuertheleſſe in him, howſoeuer he accompliſh his work by man. Though it may ſeem an abſurd thing, that Chriſt who is the eternall wiſdome of god, doth ſend a ſcholar (who was readie to heare, &amp; did gape after inſtruction) vnto another man, that he might learne. But I anſwer, that that was don not without cauſe. For the Lord ment by this means to proue Paul his modeſtie, when he ſendeth him to one of his ſcholers to be taught: as if he himſelf wold not vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe as yet to ſpeak vnto him familiarly, but ſendeth him to his ſeruants, whom he did of late both ſo proudly contemne, &amp; ſo cruelly perſecute. And we are alſo taught humilitie vnder his perſon. For if Chriſte made Paul ſubiect to the teaching of a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon diſciple, which of vs can grudge to heare any teacher, ſo that he be appointed by Chriſte: that is, hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare himſelf to be his miniſter in deed? Therfore wheras Paul is ſent to Ananias, let vs know that that is done to adorne the miniſterie of the church. This is aſſuredly no ſmal honor, wherunto it pleaſeth god to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt mandkind, when as he choſeth our brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> amongſt vs, to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters of his wil, when as he cauſeth his holy oracles to ſound in the mouth of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which is naturally giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to lying &amp; vanitie. But the vntha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>k<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes of the world bewraieth it ſelf again herein, that no man can abide to hear whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God ſpeaketh by the mouth of man. All men could deſire to haue hangels come flying vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or that heauen ſhould bee now and then cut aſunder, &amp; that the viſible glory of god ſhuld come thence.

                  <hi>It ſhalbe told thee.</hi> Chriſt putteth Ananias in his place by theſe wordes, as touching the office of teaching: not becauſe he reſigneth his authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to him, but becauſe he ſhalbe a faithful miniſter, &amp; a ſincere preacher of the goſpel. Therfore we muſt alwayes vſe this moderatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that we hear God alone in Chriſt, &amp; Chriſt himſelfe alone, yet as hee ſpeaketh by his miniſters: and theſe two vices muſt be auoided, that the miniſters be not proude, vnder colour of ſuch a precious function: or that their baſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition impaire no whit of the dignitie of heauenly wiſdome.</p>
               <p n="7">7 <hi>And the men.</hi> He ſpeaketh now briefly of the companions of Paul, that they were witneſſes of the viſion. Yet it ſeemeth that this narration doth not in all points agree with that of Paul,<note place="margin">Acts. 22.9.</note> which wee ſhall ſee in the 22. chap. For hee wil ſay there, that his companions were terrified with the light, but they heard no voice. Some there be, who think that it was a fault, and that through ignorance of the writer, the negation is placed out of his right place. I think that it is no hard matter to anſwere it: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it may be that they heard the ſound of the voice, yet did they not diſcern, either who it was that ſpake, or what was ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. They heard not, ſaith he, the voice of him that ſpake with me. Surely, this is the meaning of theſe words, that he alone knew the ſpeech of Chriſt. It followeth not thereupon, but that the reſt might haue heard a darke &amp; doubtful voice. Wheras Luke ſaith in this place, that there was a voice heard, &amp; no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſeen, his meaning is that the voice proceeded from no man, but that it was vttered by God. Therefore to the ende the myracle may carry the greater credit, Paul his companions ſee a light like to lightning, they ſee Paul lie proſtrate, a voice they heare (though not diſtinctly) ſounding from heauen: and yet neuertheleſſe Paul alone is taught what hee muſt doe.</p>
               <p n="8">8 <hi>He was rayſed vp from the earth.</hi> Luke addeth now that he was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with ſo great feare, that he could not riſe of himſelfe: and not that only: but he was alſo blinde for a time, that he might forget his former wit and wilineſſe. When as he ſaith, that <hi>after that his eyes were opened, hee ſawe not:</hi> it ſeemeth that it doth not agree with the other wordes which ſhall follow by &amp; by, that his eyes were couered as it wer with ſcales: but the meaning of this place is, that he was blind indeed, and depriued of his ſight for that three dayes: becauſe when he opened his eyes, he ſaw nothing.</p>
               <p n="9">9 Whereas he ſaieth that he neither eate nor dranke for the ſpace of three dayes, that is to be counted a part of the miracle. For although the men of the eaſt countrie endure hunger better than wee, yet wee doe not reade that anie did faſt three dayes, ſaue onelie thoſe who had want of vittal, or who were conſtrained by ſome greater neceſſitie.

Therfore it was requiſite, that hee ſhould haue ſome certaine teſtimonie of his calling, that there ſhould happie ſucceſſe bee promiſed to his labour, that he might take that in hand with a ioyfull &amp; valiaunt minde, which the Lord commanded. Furthermore, as Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimateth and confirmeth Ananias, by appearing to him in the viſion: ſo he prepareth and maketh Paul readie for all thinges, that hee may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue Ananias reuerently, as if he would receiue an angell comming fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heauen. The Lord could haue ſent Paule ſtraightway vnto Ananias, and haue ſhewed him his houſe, but this was more fit for his confirmation: becauſe he knew the better, that the Lorde had a care of him. And alſo the Lorde ſetteth out his grace vnto vs, that as he ſtopped Paul before, ſo nowe he reacheth him his hande of his owne accord, by his miniſter. And in the meane ſeaſon we are alſo taught by his example, to be more readie and carefull to ſeeke out the loſt ſheepe.</p>

                  <hi>In a viſion.</hi> This worde <hi>viſion</hi> ſignifieth ſome ſight which was ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the eyes, to teſtifie gods preſence. For this is the vſe of viſions, that the maieſtie of the worde being well proued, it may purchaſe credite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men. Which kind of confirmation God vſed oftentimes toward the Prophetes: as he ſaith that he ſpeaketh to his ſeruaunts by a viſion or by a dreame. He hath in deed ſuffered Satan to deceiue the vnbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers with falſe imaginations and viſures. But foraſmuche as Satan his iuggling caſts are of power only in darknes: God doth lighten the minds of his children ſo, that they aſſure the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues that they need not to feare legierdemaine. Therefore Ananias anſwereth, <hi>Here am I, Lord:</hi> knowing in deed that it was God.</p>
               <p n="11">11 <hi>For behold he praieth.</hi> Luke ſheweth that Paul gaue himſelf to praier thoſe three dayes: and peraduenture this was one cauſe why he faſted, although it be certaine, as I haue alreadie ſaide, that hee ſuffered ſuche long hunger, becauſe he was after a ſort depriued of ſenſe, as men which are in a traunce vſe to be. Chriſt doth aſſuredly ſpeake of no ſhort praier in this place, but hee doeth rather ſhewe, that Paule continued in this kinde of exerciſe, vntyll hee ſhoulde bee more quiet in minde. For beſides other cauſes of terrour, that voice mighte ſound in his eares, Saul, Saul why perſecuteſt thou mee? And it is not to bee doubted
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:7788:117"/> but that the careful looking for of a perfect reuelation, did maruellouſly trouble his minde: but this was the reaſon why the Lorde cauſed him to wait three dayes, that he might the more kindle in him an earneſt deſire to pray.</p>
               <p n="12">12 <hi>He ſaw a man named Ananias.</hi> It is vncertaine whither Luke do yet repete the words of Chriſt, or hee adde this of his owne. Thoſe which take it in the perſon of Luke, are mooued with ſome ſhew of abſurditie, becauſe it is an vnlikely thing, that Chriſt vſed theſe wordes. Although this may be eaſily anſwered thus: to wit, that Chriſt confirmeth Ananias after this ſort, There is no cauſe why thou ſhouldeſt feare, but that hee will receiue thee willingly, foraſmuch as he already knoweth thy ſhape by a viſion. I haue alſo told him thy name, and whatſoeuer thou ſhalt do with him. Yet may the reader chooſe whether he will.</p>

                  <p n="13">
                     <hi>13</hi> And Ananias anſwered, Lord, I haue heard of many of this man: what hurt he hath done to thy ſeruants at Ieruſalem:</p>
                  <p n="14">
                     <hi>14</hi> And heere he hath power from the Prieſts, to binde all which call vppon thy name.</p>

                     <hi>15</hi> And the Lord ſaide vnto him, Goe, becauſe he is a choſen instrument to me, to beare my name before the Gentiles, and Kings, and the children of Iſrael.</p>
                  <p n="16">
                     <hi>16</hi> For I will ſhew him, how great things he must ſuffer for my name.</p>

               <p n="13">13 <hi>Lord, I haue heard.</hi> In that Ananias obiecteth the daunger to the Lord, he bewraieth his weakneſſe of faith therein. Therfore we ſee that the ſaints and ſeruants of God are afraid of death, which thing keepeth them backe from doing their dutie, yea it cauſeth them ſometimes to ſtagger. Ananias would gladly go to ſome other place: but this is a point of a good man, that he yeeldeth not ſo much to feare, that he withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himſelfe from Chriſts obedience. And therfore this is a ſigne of rare obedience, that although through feare of death hee were ſomewhat ſlacke at the firſt, yet hauing forgotten himſelfe by and by, he maketh great haſte to goe whither Chriſt called him. And yet notwithſtanding he refuſeth not flatly in theſe words, to doe that which he is commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to do: but vſeth an excuſe verie modeſtly: Lord, what meaneth this, that thou ſendeſt me to the hangman? Therefore we may ſee a deſire to obey, mixed with feare.</p>
               <p n="14">14 <hi>He hath power to binde.</hi> We gather by theſe words, that the fame of the perſecution which Saule went about, was ſpread farre and wide: for which cauſe his conuerſion was more famous. Neuertheleſſe the Lorde ſuffered the faithfull to bee euill intreated, that the benefite of ſuch ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain deliuerance might afterward be the more excellent. We muſt mark that ſpeech, when he ſaith that the godly call vpon the name of Chriſt. For whether you vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d it, that in aſmuch as they profeſſed that they were Chriſts, they reioyced therefore in him, or that they vſed to flie to him for ſuccour, inuocation cannot be without ſure confidence. By both which the diuinitie of Chriſt is not onely proued, but alſo if the ſecond be receiued, which ſeemeth to be more naturall, wee are taught by the
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:7788:118"/> example of the faithfull, to call vppon the name of Chriſt, when hee is preached to vs.</p>
               <p n="15">15 <hi>Go, becauſe he is an elect instrument.</hi> The commandement repeted the ſecond time, and alſo the promiſe of ſucceſſe added, taketh away all doubtfulneſſe. Therefore ſlouth ſhall want an excuſe, if it be neuer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed, after that many prickes be vſed: like as we ſee that very manie, who howſoeuer the Lorde cry vnto them continually, doe not onely loyter during their whole life, but doe alſo cheriſh their ſlothfulnes, by al meanes poſſible. If any man obiect that the Lord ſpeaketh not at this day in a viſion: I anſwere, that foraſmuch as the Scripture is abundantly confirmed to vs, we muſt heare God thence. <hi>A veſſel of election,</hi> or as Eraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus tranſlateth it, an Elect inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is taken for an excellent miniſter. The word <hi>Inſtrument</hi> doth ſhew that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can do nothing, ſaue in aſmuch as God vſeth their induſtrie at his pleaſure. For if we be inſtruments, he alone is the autor: the force and power to doe is in his power alone. And that which Chriſt ſpeaketh in this place of Paul, appertaineth to al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, both one and other. Therefore how ſtoutlie ſoeuer euery man labor, and how carefuly ſoeuer he behaue himſelf in his dutie, yet there is no cauſe why he ſhuld chalenge to himſelf any part of praiſe. Thoſe which diſpute ſubtillie about the worde <hi>Veſſel,</hi> dote through ignorance of the Hebrue tongue. Luke putteth the Genetiue caſe for the Datiue, and that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the common cuſtome of the Hebrue tongue. And hee meant to expreſſe a certain excellencie: as if hee ſhould haue ſaid, that this man ſhall be no common miniſter of Chriſt: but ſhalbe indued with ſingular excellencie aboue others. Neuertheleſſe we muſt note that if anie thing bee excellent, it dependeth vpon the fauour of God: as Paul himſelfe teacheth elſe where: Who is hee that ſeparateth thee? to wit, that thou ſhouldſt excell others. To conclude, Chriſt pronounceth that Paul was choſen vnto great and excellent things.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 4.7.</note>

                  <hi>To beare my name amongst the Gentils.</hi> To him who went about before to ſuppreſſe the name of Chriſt, is the ſame now co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted to be borne. If wee pleaſe to take <hi>Schenos</hi> for a veſſell, this ſhould be a continuall me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor: becauſe a miniſter of the Goſpell ſerueth in ſteed of a veſſell to publiſh the name of Chriſte: but becauſe it ſignifieth rather amongſt the Hebrues anie inſtrument generallie, I take theſe words <hi>to carrie my name,</hi> for to extoll the ſame vnto due honour. For Chriſt is placed after a ſort in his princelie throne, whenas the worlde is brought vnder his power by the preaching of the Goſpell.</p>
               <p n="16">16 <hi>And becauſe.</hi> Paul could not doe this and haue Satan quiet, and the worlde to yeald to him willingly, therefore Luke addeth, that hee ſhalbee alſo taught to beare the Croſſe. For the meaning of the words is, I will accuſtome him to ſuffer troubles, to endure reproches, and to abide all manner conflictes, that nothing may terrifie him and keepe him backe from doing his duetie. And when Chriſt maketh himſelfe Paule his teacher in this matter, hee teacheth, that the more euerie man hath profited in his ſchoole, the more able is hee to beare the Croſſe. For wee ſtriue againſt it, and refuſe it as a thinge moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:7788:118"/> vntill hee make our mindes more gentle. Alſo this place tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, that no man is fitte to preach the Goſpell, ſeeing the worlde is ſette againſt it, ſaue onely hee which is armed to ſuffer. Therefore yf wee will ſhewe our ſelues faithfull miniſters of Chriſt, wee muſt not onely craue at his handes the Spirite of knoweledge and wiſdome, but alſo of conſtancie and ſtrength, that wee may neuer be diſcouraged by labouring and toyling, which is the eſtate of the Godlie.</p>

                     <hi>17</hi> And Ananias went, and entred into the houſe, and when hee had laide his hands vpon him, he ſaid: Brother Saul, the Lorde hath ſent me, namely Ieſus, who appeared to thee in the way as thou camest, that thou maist recouer thy ſight, and that thou maist be filled with the holy Ghost:</p>

The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles tranſlated that cuſtome taken from ſacrifices, to their vſe: either when they gaue the viſible graces of the Spirite: or when they made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man miniſter of the Church. To this end doth Ananias lay his hands now vpon Paul, partly that hee may conſecrate him vnto God, partlie that he may obtaine for him the gifts of the Spirit. And though there be no mention made of doctrine in this place, yet it ſhall appeare after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward by Pauls narration, that Ananias was alſo commaunded to teach him, and by Baptiſme which was later in order, we gather that he was inſtructed in the faith. Let the readers note out of the Chapter next going before, how this ceremonie is effectual to giue the Spirit. But ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Paul receiued the Spirite by the hand of Ananias, the papiſtes are more than ridiculous, who will haue the Byſhops alone to lay on their hands.</p>
               <p n="18">18 <hi>There fell from his eies as it had ben ſcales.</hi> The blindneſſe of Paul, as we haue ſaide before, did not proceede from feare alone, or from ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe: but by this meanes was hee admoniſhed of his former blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that he might quite abandon that boldneſſe and vaine confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence wherewith hee was puffed vp.<note place="margin">Acts. 22.3.</note> Hee boaſteth that he was taught at the feete of Gamaliel: and vndoubtedly hee thought verie well of his great witneſſe, which was notwithſtanding meere blindneſſe. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee is depriued of the ſight of his bodie three dayes, that hee may beginne to ſee with his minde: for thoſe muſt become fooles, whoſoeuer they bee, which ſeeme to themſelues wiſe, that they may attaine to true wiſedome. For ſeeing that Chriſt is the ſunne of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, in ſeeing without him, we ſee not: it is he alſo which ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the eyes of the minde. Both things were ſhewed to Paul, and to vs are they ſhewed in his perſon: for hee hath his eies couered with ſcales: that condemning all his knowledge of ignorance, he may learne
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:7788:119"/> that he hath neede of new light, which he hath hitherto wanted: and he is taught that he muſt fet the true light from none other, ſaue only from Chriſt, and that it is giuen by no other meanes, ſaue onely through his goodnes. Furthermore whereas being pyned with three dayes hunger, he maketh no haſte to receiue meat vntill he bee baptized, thereby ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth the earneſt deſire he had to learne: becauſe he refreſhed not his body with meat, vntill his ſoule had receiued ſtrength.</p>

               <p n="20">20 Luke declareth now how fruitful Paul his conuerſion was: to wit, that he came abroad by and by: and did not onely profeſſe that hee was a diſciple of Chriſt, but did alſo ſet himſelfe againſt the furie and hatred of the enimies, by defending the Goſpel ſtoutly. Therefore hee who of late ran headlong againſt Chriſt with furious force, doth now not only ſubmit himſelfe meekely vnto his will and pleaſure, but like a ſtout ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard bearer fighteth euen vnto the vtmoſt daunger to maintain his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Certain it is, that hee was not ſo quickly framed by Ananias his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrie: but that ſo ſoone as hee had learned the firſt priciples by mans mouth, he was extolled by God vnto higher things afterward. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth the ſumme of his preaching briefly, when hee ſaieth, That Chriſt was the ſonne of God. In the ſame ſenſe he ſaith ſhortly after, That he was Chriſt. And vnderſtand thus much, that when Paul intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of the Law and the Prophets of the true office of the Meſſias, he taught alſo that al whatſoeuer was promiſed of, and was to be hoped for at the handes of the Meſſias, was reuealed and giuen in Chriſt. For the words ſignifie thus much, when he ſaith that he preached that Chriſt is the ſonne of God. That was vndoubtedly a principle amongſt the Iewes, that there ſhoulde a redeemer come from God, who ſhoulde reſtore all things to an happie eſtate. Paul teacheth that Ieſus of Nazareth is hee: which he cannot do, vnleſſe he ſhake off thoſe groſſe errours, which he had conceiued of the earthly kingdome of the Meſſias. Certaine it is that Paule declared how Chriſt was promiſed in the Lawe, and to what end: but becauſe all tended to this end, that hee might prooue that the ſonne of Mary, was he of whom the Law and the Prophets bare witnes,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:7788:119"/> therefore Luke is content with this one word onely.</p>
               <p n="21">21 <hi>They were all amaſed.</hi> This is added, that wee may knowe that the power of God was acknowledged. For ſeeing that the zeale of Paul a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Goſpel was openly knowne, they ſaw no other cauſe of ſuch a ſodaine chaunge, but the hand of God. And therefore this is alſo one fruite of the myracle, that they all wonder at him being made a newe man ſo ſodainly, ſo that his doctrine doth the more moue their minds. Whereas they ſay that hee raged horriblie with great crueltie, and that he came of late to Damaſcus, that he might proceed in his purpoſe: theſe circumſtances ſerue to augment the myracle. Wee muſt alſo note the phraſe, <hi>thoſe</hi> which call vpon this name: which witneſſeth that the godly did ſo profeſſe the name of Chriſt, that they placed all their hope of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation in him: according to that, Theſe men put their truſt in chariots, and others in horſes, but we will call vpon the name of the Lord. Final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly whatſoeuer the ſcripture commaundeth concerning calling vpon the name of God, it agreeth to the perſon of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="22">22 <hi>And Saul waxed ſtronger.</hi> Luke doeth not onely in this place com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the bold zeale of Paule in confeſſing the faith of Chriſt: but alſo he telleth vs that he vſed ſtrong reaſons to conuince the Iewes: <hi>He wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtrong,</hi> ſaith he, that is, he gat the victorie in diſputation, his confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on did carrie with it great force and efficacie, becauſe being furniſhed with teſtimonies of Scripture, and ſuch other helpes of the holy Ghoſt, he did as it were tread all his aduerſaries vnder his feete. For the word <hi>confounded</hi> which Luke vſeth, doth ſignifie, That, for as much as Paul did vrge them out of meaſure, they were ſo ſtriken that they coulde not tell where they were. The manner of the confounding is expreſſed, becauſe Paul proued that Ieſus was Chriſt. For the ſenſe is this, that euen when the Iewes were moſt deſirous to reſiſt, they were ouercome &amp; confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. So that Paul tried by experience, that that was moſt true which he himſelfe affirmeth, that the Scripture is profitable to conuince. Alſo he performed that which he required elſewhere, of a Biſhop and teacher: for hee was armed with the word of God to maintaine the trueth. And Luke ſetteth down two things: that Paul ſo gate the victory in diſputing,<note place="margin">2. Tim. 3.16. Titus. 1.7.</note> that he ouerthrew the Iewes: and yet their ſtubberneſſe was not broken and tamed, that they yeelded to the trueth: becauſe their conſciences rage neuertheleſſe inwardly, and being throwne downe from their falſe opinion, they doe not ſubmit themſelues to Chriſt. Whence had Paule this victorie, ſaue onely becauſe the Scripture was his ſworde? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſo often as Heretikes ſtande vp to reſiſt the true faith, ſo often as wicked men endeuour to ouerthrowe all godlineſſe, ſo often as the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly doe obſtinately reſiſt, let vs remember that wee muſt fet armour hence. Becauſe the papiſts finde no weapons in Scripture, yea becauſe they ſee that it maketh quite againſt them, they flie vnto this miſerable fortreſſe, That they muſt not diſpute with heretikes, And that there can no certaine thing be ſet downe out of Scripture. But if Satan himſelfe be vanquiſhed with the ſword of the worde, why ſhall it not bee able to put heretikes to flight? not that they will ſubmit themſelues, or make an
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:7788:120"/> ende of murmuring: but becauſe they ſhall lie ouercome in themſelues. And if ſo be it wee couet to eſcape this trouble, let vs raiſe no tumults a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, but let vs with a quiet and meeke ſpirit receiue that peace which the Scripture offereth vs.</p>
               <p n="23">23 <hi>When many dayes were fulfilled.</hi> He ſaith that many dayes were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired: that we may know that Paul had ſome ſpace of time granted him wherein he might doe good. For although the Iewes did reſiſt him euen from the firſt day, yet the Lord did not ſuffer the courſe which hee had begunne well, to be broken off ſo ſoone, ſo he doth with his wonderfull counſell hinder the purpoſes of the enimies, ſtay their indeuours, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine their malice and madneſſe, whiles that he furthereth the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel: and alſo we ſee what the hatred of the truth doth. For when the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ſee that they are vnable to reſiſt, they are carried headlong vnto bloodie furie. They would gladly contemne the word of God, if they coulde: but becauſe they are enforced whether they will or no, to feele the force thereof, they runne headlong like furious beaſts with blinde violence. The vnaduiſed and raſh heate of zeale will alwayes almoſt breake out into ſuch crueltie vnleſſe men ſuffer themſelues to bee ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the worde of God. This is aſſuredly horrible blindneſſe. For why are they ſo madde, ſaue onely becauſe their wounded conſcience doth vexe them? But God doth by this meanes puniſh their hypocriſie: who doe therefore hate ſounde religion, becauſe being friends of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, they flie the light. Furthermore wee ſee howe ſweetly theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous zealous fellowes graunt themſelues libertie to doe whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer them luſteth, when Satan hath once pricked them forward to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute the trueth. For they feare not to take counſell vnder colour of zeale, to put a man to death, which they knowe is meere wickedneſſe: as at this day the Papiſts thinke that they may do whatſoeuer they will, ſo they can quench the doctrine of the Goſpel: they rage not only with ſworde: but they goe about by laying in waite, by trecherie, and by moſt execrable meanes to deſtroy vs. We muſt firſt beware that that do not befall vs, that wee intangle not our ſelues in the defenſe of euill cauſes: ſecondly that we handle thoſe cauſes wel, which we know are good. But it is to be thought that they laide wait for Paul priuily: that done, when they could do no good this way, it is likely that they came to the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of the citie, and that then the gates were watched, that they might by one meanes or other catch him. For Paul ſaith, that Aretas the kings gouernour commaundeth that which Luke attributeth in this place to the Iewes.</p>
               <p n="25">25 <hi>The diſciples hauing taken him by night.</hi> There is a queſtion moued here, whether it were lawfull for the diſciples to ſaue Paul thus or no? and alſo whether it were lawful for Paul to eſcape danger by this means or no? For the Lawes ſay that the walles of cities are holy, and that the gates are holy. Therefore hee ought rather to haue ſuffered death than to haue ſuffered a publike order to bee broken for his ſake. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere that wee muſt conſider why it is decreed by the Lawes that the walles ſhoulde not be violated: to wit, that the cities may not be laide

Therefore it was no leſſe lawfull for the faithfull to let downe Paul in a basket, than it ſhalbe lawfull for any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate perſon to leape ouer a wall, that he may auoide the ſodaine inua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the enimie. Cicero doeth handle this later member, and he ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth downe very well, that although the Law forbid a ſtraunger to come neere the wall, yet doth not he offende, who ſhal go vp vpon the wall to ſaue the Citie, becauſe the lawes muſt alwayes bee inclined to equitie. Therefore Paul is not to be blamed, becauſe he eſcaped by ſtealth, ſeing he might do that without raiſing any tumult amongſt the people. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe we ſee how the Lord vſeth to humble thoſe that be his, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Paule is enforced to ſteale his life from the watchmen of the Citie, if he will ſaue himſelfe.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 11.32</note> Therefore he reckoneth this example a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt his infirmities.

               <p n="26">26 <hi>When Saul was.</hi> Theſe were yet hard entrances for Paul who was as yet but a freſh water ſoldier: in that when hee had hardly eſcaped the hands of the enimies, the diſciples would not receiue him. For he might haue ſeemed to haue beene ſo toſt too and fro as it were in moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kage, that he could haue no reſting place: all his owne nation was ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him for Chriſtes cauſe: the Chriſtians refuſe him: might hee not haue beene quite diſcouraged and out of hope, as one expelled out of mens companie? Firſt, what remaineth, but that he fall away from the Church, ſeing he is not receiued? But when he remembreth the life which hee had led aforetime, hee maruelleth not that they are afraid of him. Therefore he doth patiently ſuffer the brethren to refuſe his company, ſeeing they had iuſt cauſe of feare. This was true conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that whereas he raged horribly before: he doth now valiantly ſuffer the ſtormes of perſecutions: &amp; in the meane ſeaſon, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as he cannot be
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:7788:121" rendition="simple:additions"/> admitted into the companie of the godly, he waiteth with a quiet mind, vntill God reconcile them vnto him. We muſt diligentlie note what he deſireth: to wit, that he may be numbred amongſt the diſciples of Chriſt: this can he not obtaine, here is no ambition: but he was to be inſtructed by this meanes, to make more account euen of the loweſt place amongſt the diſciples of Chriſt, than of all maſterſhips in corrupt and reuolted Synagogues. And from this ſubmiſſion was he exalted vnto the higheſt degree of honour, that he might be the principal doctour of the church, euen vnto the end of the world. But no man is fit to be a teacher in the Church, ſaue onely he who willingly ſubmitteth himſelfe, that hee may be a fellow diſciple with other men.</p>
               <p n="27">27 <hi>When Barnabas had taken him.</hi> Whereas the diſciples fled ſo faſt from Paul, that was peraduenture a point of too great fearefulnes, and yet he ſpeaketh of none of the common ſort, but of the Apoſtles themſelues. But he doth either extenuate or lighten their fault, becauſe they ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted him for iuſt cauſes, whom they had founde and tryed to bee ſuch a deadly enimie, and it was to be feared leaſt they ſhould raſhly indanger themſelues, if they ſhould haue ſhewed themſelues to bee ſo eaſie to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat. Therefore I thinke that they are not to be blamed for that feare which they conceiued for iuſt cauſe, or that they deſerue to be euen ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed for the ſame. For if they had beene called to giue an account of their faith, they would haue prouoked not Paul onely, but alſo all the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of hell, without feare. Whence we gather that euery feare is not to be condemned, but ſuch as cauſeth vs to turne aſide from our duty. The narration which Luke addeth may be referred as wel vnto the perſon of Barnabas as of Paul: yet I thinke rather that Paule declareth to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles what had befallen him: and yet the ſpeech may bee well applyed to Barnabas, eſpecially when as mention is made of Paul his boldnes.</p>
               <p n="28">28 Luke ſaieth afterward that Paul went in and out with the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: which ſpeech ſignifieth amongſt the Hebrewes familiaritie: as the inhabitants of Citties are ſaid to go in and out at the gates of the cittie. Therefore after that Paul was commended by the teſtimonie of Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas, he began to be counted one of the flock, that he might be throughly knowne to the church. Luke ſaith againe, that he delt <hi>boldly</hi> in the name of the Lord: by which words he commendeth his ſtoutnes and courage in profeſſing the Goſpel. For hee durſt neuer haue whiſpered amidſt ſo manie lets, vnleſſe he had beene endowed with rare conſtancie. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe all men are taught what they ought to doe: to wit, euery man according to the meaſure of his faith. For though all bee not Pauls, yet the faith of Chriſt ought to engender in our minds ſo great boldneſſe, that we be not altogither dumbe, when we haue neede to ſpeake. I take the name of the Lord in this place, for the profeſſion of the Goſpel: in this ſenſe, that Paul defended Chriſts cauſe manfully.</p>
               <p n="29">29 <hi>Hee diſputed with the Grecians.</hi> Eraſmus noteth well in this place, that thoſe are here called Grecians, not which came of Grecians, but rather thoſe Iewes, who were ſcattered throughout diuers parts of the world. Thoſe men were wont to come togither to Ieruſalem to worſhip.
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:7788:121"/> And it is to be thought that Paul diſputed rather with ſtraungers and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liants, than with thoſe who dwelt at Ieruſalem, becauſe this latter ſort would neuer haue abid him, neither had it bene wiſely done to come in their ſight. Therefore being excluded from thoſe who knew him before, he tried whether there were any hope to doe good amongſt men whom he knew not: ſo that he did moſt ſtoutly whatſoeuer concerned the duty of a valiant ſoldiar.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They would haue ſlaine him.</hi> Behold againe fury in ſteede of zeale: and it cannot otherwiſe be, but that hypocriſie and ſuperſtition will be cruel and fierce. The godly muſt be incenſed with an holy wrath, when they ſee the pure truth of God corrupt with falſe and wicked opinions: yet ſo that they moderate their zeale, that they ſet downe nothing vntill they haue throughly weighed the cauſe: and ſecondly that they aſſaie to bring thoſe into the way who wander out of the ſame. Laſtly that if they ſee their ſtubberneſſe to be paſt hope, they themſelues take not the ſworde in hande, becauſe they muſt know that they haue no authoritie graunted them of the Lorde to puniſh or reuenge. But hypocrites are alwayes readie to ſhedde blood before they knowe the matter. So that ſuperſtition is bloodie through blind and headlong furie. But Paul who of late ranne vp and downe to vex the godly, can abide no where nowe. And yet this eſtate was farre better for him, than if he ſhould haue reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in peace and quietnes, driuing the godly euery where out of their places.</p>
               <p n="30">30 In that he went to <hi>Tarſus,</hi> he did it vndoubtedly to this end, that hee might carrie the doctrine of the Goſpel thither: becauſe hee hoped that he ſhould haue ſome fauour, and authority in his countrie, where he was famous: yet was he brought thither by the brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that they might deliuer him from the lying in wait.</p>
               <p n="31">31 <hi>Then the Churches.</hi> Luke his meaning is that the enimies of the Goſpel were greatly prouoked by Paul his preſenſe. For why was there ſuch peace made ſodainly by his departure, ſaue onely becauſe the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſight of him did prouoke the furie of the enimies? And yet this is no reproch to him, as if he had beene as it were ſome trumpet in warre: but Luke doth rather commende him for this, becauſe hee made the wicked runne madde, onely with the ſmell of him when hee was neere them. For Chriſt meant ſo to triumph in him, that he might be no leſſe a trouble than an ornament to his Church. Therefore wee are taught by this example that thoſe are not by and by to be condemned, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame the madneſſe of the wicked more than others. Which admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not a little profitable. For as wee are too daintie and too much beſotted with the loue of our owne reſt, ſo we be alſo ſometimes angrie with the beſt and moſt excellent ſeruants of Chriſt, if wee thinke that through their vehemencie the wicked are pricked forward to doe hurt. And by this meanes wee doe iniurie to the Spirite of God, whoſe force and ſpeech kindleth all that flame. And whereas Luke ſaieth that the Churches had peace, let vs knowe that it was not continuall, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Lorde graunted his ſeruaunts ſome ſhort breathing. For thus
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:7788:122"/> doth he beare with our infirmitie, when hee appeaſeth or mittigateth the windes and ſtormes of perſecutions, leaſt if they ſhould hold on ſtill, they ſhould vrge vs out of meaſure. And this bleſſing is not to be deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, neither is it any common bleſſing, when as the Churches haue peace. But Luke addeth other things which are of farre more valew: to wit, that the Churches were edified, they walked in the feare of God, and they were filled with the conſolation of the Spirite. For as wee are wont to ryot and exceed in time of peace, the Churches are more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie for the moſt part, amidſt the tumults of warre, than if they ſhoulde enioy what reſt they would deſire. But and if holy conuerſation, and the conſolation of the Spirit, whereby their ſtate doeth floriſh, be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: they looſe not only their felicitie, but they come to nought. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let vs learne not to abuſe externall peace in banqueting and idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: but the more reſt wee haue giuen vs from our enimies, to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage our ſelues to go forward in godlineſſe, whiles we may. And if at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny time the Lord let loſe the bridle to the wicked to trouble vs, let the inwarde conſolation of the ſpirite bee ſufficient for vs. Finally as well in peace as in warre let vs alwayes ioyfully goe forward toward him who hath a reward for vs. <hi>Edification</hi> may be taken either for increaſe, to wit, whiles the Churches are augmented with the number of the faithfull, or for their going forward who are alreadie in the flocke, to wit, whiles they haue new gifts giuen them, and haue greater confirmation of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe. In the firſt ſignification it ſhall be referred vnto the perſons: in the ſeconde vnto the giftes of the Spirite. I imbrace both willingly: that there were ſome euer nowe and then gathered vnto the Church, who were ſtraungers before, and thoſe who were of the houſhold of the Church, did encreaſe in godlineſſe and other vertues. Furthermore the metaphore of a building is verie conuenient, becauſe the Church is the temple and houſe of God,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 3.15. 1. Cor. 3.16.19.</note> and euerie one of the faithfull is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a temple. The two thinges which followe, that They walked in the feare of God, and that they were filled with the conſolation of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, are partes of that edification. Therefore though the Churches had peace, yet they were not drunken with delights, and earthlie ioy, but truſting to Gods helpe, they were more emboldned to glorifie God.</p>

And it was meete that the Apoſtles who had no certaine place of abode, ſhoulde wander hither and thither as occaſion was offered, wherefore whiles they are all occupied in diuerſe parts, Peter tooke vpon him this charge Whereby the fooliſhneſſe of the Papiſtes is refuted, who gather Peter his primacie, by the authoritie which he had to viſite. As if the reſt of the Apoſtles did liue idlely at Ieruſalem like priuate men, when Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter did viſite the Churches. Againe, admitte wee graunt that Peter was the chiefe Apoſtle, which thing the Scripture ſheweth oftentimes, doth it thereupon follow that he was the head of the world? but would to God the Biſhoppe of Rome, who will be counted Peter his ſucceſſor, woulde trauell as hee did to animate the brethren, and woulde euerie where proue in deede that he is the Apoſtle of Chriſt. Nowe he which out of his throne doth with more than tyrannous Lordſhip oppreſſe all the Churches, pretendeth that Peter did viſit the Churches with great paines.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Which dwelt at Lydda.</hi> Lydda which was afterward called Dioſpolis, was ſituate not farre from the mediterranean ſea, being a renowmed citie as well for antiquitie as alſo for many giftes. Ioppa was nigh to this Citie, which had a famous hauen, though very full of rockes. The Citie it ſelfe ſtood vpon an high cliffe, whence they might ſee to Ieruſalem. At this day there is nothing to be ſeene there but the ruinous wals of the olde Citie, ſaue onely that the hauen remaineth, which they call moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly Iaphet. It ſhould ſeeme that Luke nameth Aſſaron as ſome town or citie. Hierom readeth it Saron, and thinketh that thereby is meant the whole plaine lying betweene Ceſaria and Ioppa. But becauſe Ierom ſheweth no reaſon, why hee ſhould chaunge the reading which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly vſed, I admit that willingly which Luke his text ſheweth mee, to wit, that it was a citie hard by. But I do not contend about this matter: as I do not ambitiouſly gather thoſe things which may ſerue for a vaine brag: becauſe it ſhalbe ſufficient for the godly readers to knowe thoſe things which make to Luke his meaning.</p>
               <p n="34">34 <hi>Ieſus Christ make thee whole.</hi> It is certaine that the Apoſtles would neuer haue attempted the doing of myracles, vnleſſe they had ben firſt certified of the will of God, whereupon the effect did depende. For they had no ſuch power of the Spirite giuen them that they coulde heale whatſoeuer ſicke perſons they would: but as Chriſt himſelfe vſed a meaſure in his myracles: ſo he woulde haue his Apoſtles to worke no more, than he knewe were profitable. Therefore Peter did not raſhly breake out into theſe words: becauſe hee might haue ſet himſelfe to bee laught at, vnleſſe he had alredy known the wil of God. It may be that he praied apart. The Spirit who was the authour of all myracles, and which wrought by the hande of Peter, did euen then direct his tongue, and did mooue his heart by a ſecreat inſpiration. And in theſe wordes
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:7788:123" rendition="simple:additions"/> Peter ſheweth plainly that he is onely the miniſter of the myracle, and that it proceedeth from the power of Chriſt: that he may by this means extoll the name of Chriſt alone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Make thy bedde.</hi> Theſe circumſtances doe amplifie the glorie of the myracle, in that he doeth not onely recouer ſtrength to riſe, but is alſo able to make his owne bedde, who could moue no member before. To the ſame ende tendeth the continuance of the diſeaſe: for a palſie of eight yeeres continuance is not eaſily cured. In like ſort is hee ſaide to haue laid in his bed, that we may know that all his members were lame: for it was a little bed wherein they were wont to reſt at noone. Whereas Eneas was ſo readie to make trial of his members, hee thereby declared the obedience of his faith. For although hee perceiued the ſtrength which was giuen him, yet he was moſt of all moued with the efficacie of the words, to riſe.</p>
               <p n="35">35 <hi>And all thoſe.</hi> His meaning is that the myracle was publiſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and was knowne throughout the whole citie. For when the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſaith, <hi>All,</hi> it doth not comprehend euery one howe many ſo euer it noteth: but it putteth <hi>All</hi> for the more part, or for many, or for the common ſort of men. Therefore the ſenſe is, that, whereas there was but a ſmall number of Godly men there, a great part of the people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came members of the Church. And in this clauſe is expreſſed the fruite of the myracle, becauſe they embraced Chriſt and his Goſpel. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe men corrupt myracles, whoſoeuer they be which looke onely vpon men, &amp; do not turne their eies toward this end, that being inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted concerning the power and grace of Chriſt, they may ſticke only to him. Therefore that token of Chriſts diuine power which hee ſhewed, was the beginning of turning to him.</p>

               <p n="36">36 There followeth a more famous token of Chriſts power, by howe much it is more hard to reſtore life to a dead body, than to reſtore helth to a man that is ſicke. But Luke doth firſt commende the perſon of Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bita on whom the myracle was ſhewed, and that with a double title: to wit, that ſhee was Chriſts diſciple, and that ſhe approued her faith with good workes and almes. Hee hath oftentimes alreadie put this worde <hi>Diſciple</hi> for a Chriſtian man: and leaſt we ſhould thinke that that name was proper to men onely, he attributeth the ſame to a woman. And this title teacheth vs, that Chriſtianity ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be without doctrin: &amp; that that forme of learning is preſcribed, that the ſame Chriſt may be maſter to al.
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:7788:123" rendition="simple:additions"/> This is the chiefeſt praiſe, this is the beginning of holy life, this is the roote of all vertues, to haue learned of the ſonne of God, the way to liue, and the true life. The fruits of good works proceed afterward from faith. By good works, I meane the dueties of loue, wherewith our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours are holpen: and Luke placeth the chiefe kinde in Almes. The commendation of liberalitie is great, becauſe as the holy Ghoſt doeth witneſſe, it containeth in it ſelfe the ſumme of a godly and perfect life. Now we ſee what titles Thabita hath. For religion toward God or faith goeth firſt, ſecondly that ſhe exerciſed her ſelfe in helping the brethren, and ſpecially in releeuing the pouertie of the poore. For by vs it is come to paſſe, that all that helpe wherewith the poore and thoſe which are in myſery are holpen, is called <hi>Eleemoſyna.</hi> Thabita is rather a Syrian word than an Hebrew, which Luke did turne into Greek, that we might know that it was not like to the vertues of the holy women, and that ſhee was debaſed in ſuch a ſimple name. For Dorcas ſignifieth a goat: but the holines of her life did eaſily wipe away the blotte of a name not verie ſeemely.</p>
               <p n="37">37 <hi>It hapned that ſhe was ſicke.</hi> He ſaith in plaine words that ſhee was ſicke, that he may the more plainely expreſſe her death which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. To the ſame end he ſaith that the corps was <hi>waſht,</hi> and laid in an vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per chamber. Therefore theſe circumſtances ſerue to make the myracle to be beleeued. Whereas they carry her not ſtreight way to the graue, but lay her in the vpper part of the houſe, that they may keep her there, we may thereby gather that they had ſome hope of recouering her life. It is likely that the rite of waſhing, whereof Luke maketh mention, was moſt auncient. And I doe not doubt but that it came from the holy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinual courſe of times, as if it had bin deliuered from hand to hand, that in death it ſelfe ſome viſible image of the reſurrection might comfort the minds of the godly, and lift them vp vnto ſome good hope: to wit, ſeing the manifeſtation of eternall life was not ſo euident, yea ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Chriſt the pledge and ſubſtance of eternal life, was not as yet reuealed, it was requiſite that both the obſcuritie of doctrine, and alſo the abſenſe of Chriſt ſhould be ſupplied by ſuch helpes. Therefore they waſhed the bodies of the deade, that they might once ſtand before the iudgement ſeat of God being cleane. Finally there was the ſame reaſon for waſhing the deade, which was for the liuing: the dayly waſhing put them in minde of this, that no man can pleaſe God, ſaue he who ſhould be purged from his filthynes. So in the rite of burying, God would haue ſome ſigne extant, whereby men might be admoniſhed, that they went polluted out of this life, by reaſon of that filthines which they had ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered in the world. Waſhing did no more help thoſe which were dead, than buriall, but it was vſed to teach the liuing. For becauſe death hath ſome ſhew of deſtruction, leaſt it ſhould extinguiſh the faith of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, it was requiſite that contrary ſhewes ſhould bee ſet againſt it, that they might repreſent life in death. The Gentiles alſo tooke to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb n="230" facs="tcp:7788:124" rendition="simple:additions"/> this thing as in all other Ceremonies. And Chriſtians alſo haue taken to themſelues this example vnaduiſedly: as if the obſeruation of a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure vſed vnder the Lawe ought to continue alwayes. For at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Goſpel, although the neceſſitie were aboliſhed, yet the vſe was lawfull, vntill ſuch time as it might growe out of vſe in tract of time. But the munkes do at this day no leſſe imitate Iudaiſme, then did the Gentiles in times paſt, without choiſe and iudgement. For they waſh corpſes that they may bury Chriſt in ſhadowes, which being buried with him in his graue, ought neuer to haue bene vſed any more.</p>
               <p n="38">38 <hi>The diſciples which had hearde.</hi> The waſhing of the corpes ſheweth that the diſciples knew not what would come to paſſe. For by this means they make the corps readie to be buried. Yet this is ſome token of hope, that they lay her in an vpper Chamber, and ſend to Peter. Furthermore they murmur not againſt God, neither do they crie out that it is an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meete thing: but they humblie craue Gods help: not that they wil make Thabita immortall, but their onely deſire is to haue her life prolonged for a time, that ſhe may yet profit the Church.</p>

                  <p n="41">
                     <hi>41</hi> And hee reached out his hande and lift her vp, and when hee had called the ſaints and wydowes, he restored her aliue.</p>

               </q>
               <p n="39">39 <hi>And Peter aroſe.</hi> It is doubtfull whether the meſſangers declared to Peter the matter and cauſe why they fet him: yet it is more like to be true, that they requeſted him abſolutely, that he would come to work a myracle. But there ariſeth another queſtion, Whether hee knew Gods purpoſe or no. Firſt, if he ſhould miſtruſt the ſucceſſe, hee ſhoulde goe with them vnaduiſedly. I anſwere, Although he did not yet know, what the Lord would doe, yet can hee not be blamed for yeelding to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of the brethren. Alſo there were other reaſons why hee ſhoulde come: to wit, to mitigate their ſorrowe: to ſtrengthen them with god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exhortations, leaſt they ſhoulde faint, being diſcouraged with the death of one woman: to eſtabliſh the Church which was as yet tender and but as it were an infant. Laſtly this one thing ought to haue beene ſufficient for him, becauſe in refuſing he ſhuld haue ben thought proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to deſpiſe his brethren, notwithſtanding we muſt know this alſo, that ſo often as the Lorde determined to worke ſome myracle by his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, he did alwayes direct them by the ſecreat motion of the Spirit. I do
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:7788:124" rendition="simple:additions"/> not doubt but that although Peter were not yet certaine of the life of Thabita, yet did he vndoubtedly perceiue that God was his guide and conducter in that iorney: ſo that he addreſſed himſelfe to go not vnad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſedly, though being vncertaine of the euent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>All the widowes.</hi> Luke expreſſeth in this place, the cauſes, for which Thabita was raiſed from death: to wit, becauſe God pittied the poore, and did at their deſire reſtore the woman to life. There were alſo other ends: for ſeing ſhe liueth two liues, thoſe vertues which Luke commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded before, are adorned in her perſon: but the chiefe ende is, that the glorie of Chriſt may bee ſet forth. For God coulde haue kept her aliue longer, neither doth he chaunge his purpoſe, as being mooued with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, when he doth reſtore her to life againe, but becauſe many of the diſciples were weake and nouices, who had neede of confirmation, God declareth by the ſecond life of Thabita, that his Sonne is authour of life. Therefore, God did reſpect the poore and widowes in ſuch ſort, that by releeuing their pouertie hee eſtabliſhed in their mindes the faith of his Goſpel. For in this myracle hee gaue ample matter of profiting.</p>
               <p n="40">40 <hi>When they were all put forth.</hi> When as he taketh a time to pray, he ſeemeth as yet to doubt, what will be the ende. When he healed Aene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he brake out into theſe wordes without making any ſtoppe, Aeneas, Ieſus Chriſt make thee whole. But as the operation of the Spirite is not alwaies alike and the ſame, it may be that though he knew the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God, yet he went forward vnto the myracle by degrees. Yet it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be an abſurde thing, that he putteth all the Saintes out of the chamber, for whom it had bene better to haue ſeene it with their eyes, but becauſe the Lorde had not as yet reuealed the time when, and the manner how he would ſhew forth his power, hee deſireth to bee alone, that he might the more fitly pray. Alſo it might be that he knew ſome other reaſon which moued him to doe this, which we know not. It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in the ſacred hiſtory that Eliſeus did the ſame:<note place="margin">2. King. 14.32.</note> for hee being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and not ſo much as the mother of the child with him, doth ſtretch himſelfe thriſe vpon the dead corps. For the Spirite of God hath his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement motions, which if any man wil ſquare out according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon vſe of men, or meaſure by the ſenſe of the fleſh, he ſhal do wickedly and vniuſtly. We muſt this think: when as Peter, as it were douting, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a by place, he preuenteth ſuperſtition, leaſt any man ſhould aſcribe to his power the worke of God, whereof he was onely a miniſter. For he which withdrew himſelfe from company, and did pray ſo inſtantly, did plainly confeſſe that the matter was not in his own hand. Therfore whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Peter waiteth to know what pleaſeth the Lord, he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſed that he alone was the author of the worke. Kneeling in time of praier is a token of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie, which hath a double profite: that all our members may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied vnto the worſhip of God: and that the externall exerciſe of the body may helpe the weakeneſſe of the mind. But we muſt take heede ſo often as we kneele downe, that the inwarde ſubmiſſion of the heart bee anſwerable to the ceremonie, that it be not vaine and falſe.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Turning toward the corps.</hi> This ſeemeth alſo to bee contrary to reaſon, that hee ſpeaketh vnto a corps without feeling. But this ſpeaking vnto the dead corps, was one point of the vehemency, whereunto the Spirit of God enforced Peter. And if any man deſire a reaſon, this forme of ſpeech doth more liuely expreſſe the power of God in raiſing the deade, than if it ſhould be ſaid in the thirde perſon, Let this body receiue life a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine and liue. Therefore when as Ezechiel doeth ſhadowe the deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the people vnder a figure of the reſurrection: O deade bones (ſaith he) heare the word of the Lord. And Chriſt ſaith, The time ſhall come when the dead ſhall heare the voice of the ſonne of God.<note place="margin">Ezec. 37.4. Iohn 5.28.</note> For this was in deed the voice of Chriſt, which was vttered by the mouth of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and gaue breath to the body of Thabita. The circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtances following, ſerue to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firm the certainty of the myracle.</p>
               <p n="41">41 Luke repeateth againe in the end that ſhe was ſhewed openly to the diſciples. Whence we gather, that ſhe was raiſed againe, rather for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens ſake, than for her owne. Brainſicke fellowes, who dreame that the ſoule of man is onely a blaſt, which vaniſheth away vntill the day of the reſurrection, ſnatch at this place, to proue their doting withall. To what ende was it (ſay they) to call backe the ſoule of Thabita into the priſon of the body, where it ſhoulde ſuffer ſuch miſery if it were receiued into bleſſed reſt? As if it were not lawfull for God to haue reſpect of his glorie, as well in death as in life: and as if this were not the true felicitie of the godly to liue and die to him: yea as if Chriſt were not to vs a van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, as well by lyuing as dying, when wee dedicate our ſelues to him. Therefore there ſhall no inconuenience follow, if the Lord had greater reſpect to his owne glory,<note place="margin">Phil. 1.21.</note> than to Thabita: although as the commodity of the faithfull is alwayes annexed to the glory of God, this turned to her greater good, that ſhe reuiued, that ſhe might be a more excellent inſtrument of Gods goodnes and power.</p>
               <p n="42">42 <hi>And manie beleeued.</hi> Now appeare manifold fruits of the myracle. For God comforted the power, a godly matron was reſtored to the Church, in whoſe death it ſuffered great loſſe, and many are called vnto the faith. For although Peter were a miniſter of ſo great power, yet he keepeth not the men in himſelfe: but doeth rather direct them vnto Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="43">43 When as he ſaith that Peter dwelt with a tanner, we may hereby gather, of what manner men the Church of Ioppa did conſiſt. For if the chiefetaines of the Citie had beene conuerted to Chriſt, ſome one of them would haue lodged Peter. For it had bene too cruell a thing to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer an Apoſtle of Chriſt to bee ſo deſpyſed. Therefore the Lorde did ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther togither there as euery where, a Church, of the common ſort of men, that he might throwe downe the pride of the fleſh: and alſo there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by appeareth Peter his curteſie, in that he vouchſafeth to lodge with a man of that calling. Although it ſeemeth that he was rather a merchant of ſome good eſtimation, than one of the baſeſt ſort of workemen, for Luke will ſay afterward, that ther were there ſome which miniſtred vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Peter: whereby it appeareth that he was well and honeſtly vſed.</p>

               </q>
               <p n="1">1 Luke paſſeth ouer now vnto a worthie hiſtorie: to wit, that God vouchſafed to aduaunce a ſtraunger, and one vncircumciſed vnto ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar honour aboue all the Iewes: becauſe he doth both ſend his angel vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and for his ſake bringeth Peter to Ceſarea, that he may inſtruct him in the Goſpel. But firſt of all Luke ſheweth what maner perſon this Cornelius was, for whoſe cauſe an angel deſcended from heauen, and God ſpake to Peter in a viſion. He was a captaine of the Italian band. A band did conſiſt vpon a thouſand footemen, &amp; he which was chief cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, was called a Tribune or Marſhal. Againe, euery hundreth had a captaine. A legion had for the moſt part fiue bands. That band was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Italian bande, becauſe the Romanes did chooſe ſouldiers often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times from amongſt thoſe which dwelt in the prouinces, but they had the ſtrength of the armie out of Italie. Therefore Cornelius was an Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian borne. But he liued at Ceſarea with his hundred, to gard the citie. For the Romanes were woont ſo to diſtribute their places of aboade: that euery citie of renowme might haue a garriſon to ſtay ſodaine vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rores. A rare example that a ſouldier was ſo deuout toward God, ſo vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right and courteous toward men. For at that time the Italians, when as they were carried into the prouinces to liue in warfare, ranne to and fro like hungrie wolues to get ſom pray: they had for the moſt part no more religion than beaſts: they had as great care of innocencie as cutthrotes. For which cauſe the vertues of Cornelius deſerue the greater commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, in that leading a ſouldiars life which was at that time moſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt: he ſerued God holily, and liued amongeſt men without doing any hurt or iniurie. And this is no ſmall amplification of his praiſe, in that caſting away ſuperſtition wherein he was borne and brought vp, he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced the pure worſhip of God. For wee know what account the Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans made of themſelues, and how proudly they deſpiſed others. And the Iewes were at that time in ſuch contempt, that for their ſakes pure reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted infamous, &amp; almoſt execrable. Seing that none of theſe thinges could hinder Cornelius, but that forſaking his Idols, he did im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the true worſhip of the true God alone: it muſt needes be that he was endued with rare and ſingular ſinceritie. Moreouer he coulde finde
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:7788:126" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſcarce any thing amongſt the Iewes, wherwith he could be allured vnto the ſtudie of godlineſſe: becauſe there was then ſcarce one amongeſt a thouſand which had euen ſome ſmall ſmattering of the lawe. And vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly Cornelius had light vpon ſom good worſhipper of God, who beeyng ſounde from corrupt opinions, did expounde vnto him the lawe faithfully, without mixing any leauen therewith. But becauſe Luke gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth him manie titles of commendation, we muſt note them al.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Hee ſaith that he was a godly man, and one that feared God: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that like a good houſholder he had a care to inſtruct his familie: he prayſeth him afterwarde for the offices of loue, becauſe he was bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall toward all the people: and laſtly, that he prayed God continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. The ſumme is this, that Cornelius was a man of ſingular vertues, wherein the integritie of the godly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſteth, ſo that his life was framed in all points according to the rule which God preſcribeth vnto vs. And bicauſe the lawe is contained in two tables: Luke co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendeth in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer place Cornelius his godlineſſe: ſecondly hee deſcendeth vnto the ſecond part, that he exerciſed the offices of loue toward men. This is very profitable to be marked, becauſe we haue a way to liue well deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in his perſon.</p>
               <p>Wherefore in orderyng the life well, let faith and religion bee the foundation, which being taken away, all other vertues are nothing els but ſmokes. Luke reckoneth vp the feare of God and prayer, as frutes &amp; teſtimonies of godlineſſe and of the worſhip of God, and that for good cauſes. For religion cannot bee ſeparated from the feare of God &amp; the reuerence of him: neither can any man be counted godly, ſaue he who acknowledging God to be his father &amp; Lord, doth addict himſelf wholy to him. And let vs knowe, that voluntarie feare is commended in this place, when thoſe men ſubmit themſelues to God willingly and fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their heart, who duely conſider with themſelues what is due to him.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, becauſe a great part of the worlde doth with feigned tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles corrupt and depraue the worſhippe of God, Luke addeth for good cauſes that Cornelius prayed continually: wherby he doth ſignifie, that he proued not his godlineſſe only with externall ceremonies, but that he worſhipped God ſpiritually, when as he exerciſed himſelfe in prayer. We muſt alſo note the continuance of his prayer: whence wee gather, that he did not pray only coldlie, after the common cuſtome, but that he was earneſtly bent to prayer, as the continuall benefites of God doe exhort vs and pricke vs forward thereunto, and the force of faith ought there to ſhewe it ſelfe. Wherefore let euery one of vs exhort himſelfe to perſeuer in praier, by the example of Cornelius.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>With all his houſe.</hi> We muſt not lightly paſſe ouer this commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that Cornelius had a church in his houſe. And ſurely a true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipper of God, will not ſuffer ſo much as in him lyeth, God to bee bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed from his houſe. For how vnmeet a thing is it, for him to maintaine his owne right ſtoutly, that his wife, children, ſeruauntes, and maides, may obey him: and not to regard that God is diſobeied. It ſhall ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times fall out ſo, that a godly man cannot haue euen his wife to be of his
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:7788:126" rendition="simple:additions"/> minde: yet he which ruleth others, muſt indeuour by all means to haue God obeyed: and there is nothing more meete, then that wee ſhoulde conſecrate all ours to God, as our ſelues. Therefore if a godly man haue children, which are vnlike him, or a wife of euill conditions: or lewd and wicked ſeruants: let him not winke, ne yet ſuffer his houſe to bee pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted through his ſlouthfulneſſe. The diligence of Cornelius is not ſo much commended as the bleſſing of God: whereby it came to paſſe that hee hadde his houſe obedient vnto him in godlineſſe. And wee muſt not omit the circumſtaunce, that hee inſtructed his familie in the feare of God, ſetting light by the feare of daunger, which did hang ouer his head therefore. For the Iewiſh religion was in great contempt: and no citizen of Rome might freely receiue any ſtraunge religion as they called it. Wherefore although the ſincere profeſſion of the goſpel be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill ſpoken of in the world: yet is it too corrupt freghtfulneſſe, if that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt hatred hinder any man, from offering his family to God for a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, by godly inſtruction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Giuing almes.</hi> There is alſo the figure Synecdoche in this member. For as it was ſaide euen now that the worſhippe of God was proued by prayers: ſo now whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Luke ſpeketh of loue he maketh choice of one kind: wherby he ſheweth that Cornelius was a liberal and bountifull ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For our godlineſſe ought ſo to appeare to men, that we declare that we fear God, by vſing bountifulneſſe and iuſtice. The word <hi>almes</hi> is tranſlated vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe externall good workes wherewith we help the poore, foraſmuch as <hi>miſerecordia</hi> or mercy, is the inward affection of the hart properly. For from this fountain ſpringeth true and well ordered bountifulneſſe, if the troubles and ſorrowes of our brethren doe moue vs to compaſſion: if conſidering the vnitie which is amongſt vs,<note place="margin">Iſa. 58.7.</note> we foſter and cheriſhe them as we would cheriſh our own fleſh, and ſtudie to help them as we would helpe our owne members. Hypocrites are in deed ſometimes liberall, or at leaſt bountifull: but howſoeuer they waſte all, yet no reliefe whiche they ſhall beſtowe vpon the poore, ſhall be whorthie to be called by the name of almes. For we muſt holde that of Paul, He which hath no loue is nothing though he giue all his goods to the poore.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 13.3.</note> Let vs therefore learne by this worde, that God doth then allow our liberalitie, if wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue the pouertie of the poore being moued with compaſſion, and if as it were with open bowels we beſtowe that which the liberalitie of God doth giue. Whereas Luke ſaith, that he gaue almes to <hi>all</hi> the people it ſignifieth as much, as euery where to the poore. For there were not a few rich men, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to haue giuen had byn an abſurd thing. But wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he beſtowed ſo liberally vppon the Iewes, he declared, how he agreed with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: in which reſpect Luke ſaith ſhortly after that he was allowed of all the Iewes. And if ſo be it he was ſuch an excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t mir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>or of godlines &amp; holines euen when he had but a ſmall ſmattering of faith, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thogh he wer letted ſo many waies, ought not we to be aſhamed who wil be accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted moſt chriſtian doctors, &amp; are yet ſo cold in the exerciſes of godlines. If a ſmal ſparkle of faith preuailed ſo much in him, what ought the ful brightnes of knowledge to work in vs? but howſoeuer we boaſt of Chriſt with full mouth, yet how farre are wee for the moſt part from the
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:7788:127"/> example of the holy man, ſo that there appeareth ſcarce a ſmal ſhadow of thoſe vertues wherwith he was replete. For how looſe are we in prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er? how ſlow and ſluggiſh to doe the duties of mercie? Yea many are not onely letted with filthineſſe and couetouſneſſe, from giuing liberally ſo much of that which is their owne as they ought: but they are ſo infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with a deſire to haue, they are become ſo beaſtly through crueltie, that they are not afraid to robbe the poore of their ſubſtance, and to eat their very fleſh.</p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>He ſaw in a viſion.</hi> Luke putteth Viſion for a kinde of oracle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from god, that we may know that Cornelius was brought vnto the faith of Chriſt after an heauenly manner. And becauſe men are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times deceiued with iuggling, Luke ſetteth downe the time to auoid all ſuſpition, when he mentioneth the <hi>ninth houre.</hi> And at that time they were wont to deuide the day into twelue houres: from the riſing of the Sunne vntill the going downe thereof. Whereupon it followeth that it was fayre day light when the Angell appeared, that the viſion might be more euident. Although there were alwayes ſeales added vnto viſions, that they might free the ſeruants of God from feare of illuſions: becauſe when he appeared in dreames, yet were there ſuche markes of certainty imprinted in their minds as would not ſuffer them to doubt.</p>
               <p n="4">4 <hi>And he beheld, and was afraid.</hi> Luke expreſſeth his attentiueneſſe in plain words, that we may know that it was no vaine imagination, which came vpon the man as he was ſleeping or doing ſome other thing. The fear wherwith he was take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, proceeded from the perceiuing of the maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie of God. For ſo ſone as men conceiue the preſence of God, they muſt needes be afraide and caſt downe with feare. And whereas his woorde doth no whit terrifie vs, that muſt be imputed to our ſluggiſhnes, becauſe we do not know nor perceiue that it is god which ſpeketh. But the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to whom God reuealeth himſelf in his worde, doe tremble when they heare it,<note place="margin">Iſa. 66.2.5.</note> as Iſaias ſaith. Furthermore, the ſight of God is vnto them terrible, not that they may alwaies lye confounded, and be ſwallowed vp of feare, but onely that they may humblie addreſſe them ſelues to reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What is it Lorde?</hi> It appeareth plainly by this anſwere, that Cornelius his minde was touched with religion, that he knew that he had to deale with god. Therfore the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tranſlation hath it euil, <hi>Who art thou Lord?</hi> And it is likely that that which is there read, was put in in ſteede of this, for aſmuch as in the Greeke text there is no doubtfulneſſe, whereby the interpreter might be deceiued, &amp; all the coppies agree together in this reading, <hi>Ti esti.</hi> And aſſuredly when Cornelius perceiueth that it is God, he ſubmitteth himſelfe to obey: as the anſweare is nothing but a commandement.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thy prayers and almes.</hi> Becauſe God ſeemeth to bee after a ſort deafe, vnleſſe he anſwere our petitions by and by, hence commeth that ſpeech that our prayers come vnto him, and that he is mindefull thereof. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, the angel aſſigneth this as the cauſe why God vouchſafeth to ſhew to Cornelius the light of his Goſpel: becauſe hee hath hearde his
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:7788:127" rendition="simple:additions"/> praiers, and accepted his almes. Whence we gather that vertues &amp; good workes doe not only pleaſe God, but that they are alſo adourned with this excellent rewarde, that hee heapeth vpon vs &amp; enricheth vs with greater giftes for their ſakes: according to that,<note place="margin">Mat. 13.12. &amp; 21.25.</note> To him that hath ſhall be giuen. And againe, Well done good and faithfull ſeruaunt: thou haſt byn faithful in a few thinges, I will ſet thee ouer many things. For God doth after this ſort extol his by a continuall courſe of his gifts as it were by certaine ſteppes, vntil he bring them to the top. But the Papiſts abuſe this place two waies: for becauſe God reſpected the prayers and almes of Cornelius, ſo that he endued him with the faith of the Goſpel, they wreſt that vnto the preparations which they haue inuented, as if a man did get faith by his owne induſtrie and power, and did preuent the grace of God by the merites of workes. Secondly, they gather generally, that good workes are meritorious in ſuch ſort, that the graces of GOD are encreaſed in euery man as he hath deſerued. In the former they are too childiſhly deceiued, whiles that they feigne that the workes of Corneli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us were acceptable to God, before he was illuminate by faith. And wee neede not to fet a proof farre to refute their ignorance: for he could ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine nothing by prayer, vnleſſe faith went before, which only openeth the gate for vs to pray: and Auguſtine weigheth that well &amp; wiſely, who derideth Pelagius, becauſe he ſaid, that faith was obteined by prayers, before it was in man in any meaſure: Who (ſaith he) will ſeeke a Phiſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſaue he who is alreadie healed in ſome part? And it is the health of faith which teacheth vs to knocke. Furthermore, the feare of God and godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe doe plainely proue that he was regenerate by the Spirite.<note place="margin">Eze. 32.40. Eſa. 11.2.</note> For Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiel giueth this praiſe to God alone, that he frameth the hearts of men to fear him. And Eſaias ſaith, that the Spirit of the feare of God reſteth in Chriſt, that we may know that he can be found no where ſaue only in his members. Therefore it is too great folly to feigne a man in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Cornelius, who hauing nature for his guide can attaine vnto eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life, or indeuour to come thither. Therfore they reaſon blockiſhly, that we are able to preuent the grace of God with the merites of works. As touching the ſecond error, when as they imagine that euery one of vs is increaſed with greater graces as he hath deſerued, it may eaſily be refuted. Firſt, we denie that we haue any good works, which God hath not freely giuen vs: ſecondly, we ſay that the right vſe of giftes commeth from him alſo, and that this is his ſecond grace that wee vſe his former giftes well. Thirdly, we denie that we deſerue any thing by our workes, which are alwayes lame and corrupt. Good workes do in deed purchaſe for vs the encreaſe of grace, but not by their owne deſert. For they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be acceptable to God without pardon, which they obtain by the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite of faith. Wherefore it is faith alone which maketh them accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table. Thus did Cornelius obtaine more perfect knowledge of Chriſt by his prayers and almes: but in that he had god to be fauourable and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull to his prayers and almes, that did depend vpon faith. Furthermore if good workes be eſtemed by faith, it is of mercy and not of merit that God doth alow them. For becauſe faith findeth no worthie thing in vs,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:7788:128"/> wherby we can pleaſe God, it borroweth that of Chriſt which we want. And this is to peruers, that though the Papiſts haue this worde <hi>merite,</hi> euer now and than in their mouthes, and ceaſe not to puffe vppe fooles with a vaine confidence, yet they bring nothing, whereby the ſtudies of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may be moued to doe well. For they leaue their conſciences alwaies in a doubt: and commaund men to doubt whether their workes pleaſe God or no. Muſt not mens mindes needs faint when they are poſſeſſed with ſuch fear? But as for vs, though we take merit from works, yet when as we teach that there is a reward laid vp for them, we prick me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> forward with an excellent &amp; ſharpe pricke, to deſire to liue well. For we addreſſe our ſelues then ioyfully to ſerue God, when wee are perſwaded that wee looſe not our labour. And whereas there appeareth at this day no more plentifull abundance of the giftes of the Spirite, but that the more part doth rather wither away, we muſt thank our vnthankfulnes for that. For as God did crowne Cornelius his prayers &amp; almes, &amp; holineſſe with the moſt precious pearle of his Goſpel: ſo there is iuſt cauſe why he ſhoulde ſuffer vs to ſtarue, being brought vnto hungrie pouertie, when as he ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vs abuſe the treaſure of his goſpel wickedly and vngodlily. Yet here may a queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be asked, Whether faith require the knowledge of Chriſt, or it be content with the ſimple perſwaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the mercy of god? For Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius ſeemeth to haue known nothing at all concerning Chriſt. But it may be proued by ſounde proofes, that faith cannot bee ſeparated from Chriſt. For if we lay hold vpon the bare maieſtie of God, wee are rather confounded with his glory, then that we feele any taſte of his goodneſſe. Therefore Chriſt muſt come betweene, that the mind of man may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue that God is mercifull. And it is not without cauſe that he is called the image of the inuiſible God: becauſe the father offereth himſelfe to be beholden in his face alone. Moreouer, ſeeing that hee is the way, the truth, &amp; the life, whether ſoeuer thou goeſt without him, thou ſhalt bee inwrapped on euerie ſide in errours, and death ſhall meete you on euery ſide.

And eſpecially whence commeth regeneratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſaue only becauſe whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we are ingraffed into the death of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Col. 1.15. Iohn, 14, 6. Rom. 6.5.6.</note> our old man is crucified? And if Cornelius were made partaker of the Spirite of Chriſt, ther is no cauſe why we ſhuld think that he was altogether void of his faith: nether had he ſo imbraced the worſhip of the true god (who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Iewes alone did worſhip) but that he had alſo hard ſomwhat of the promiſed mediator: though the knowlege of him were obſcure, &amp; inta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled, yet was it ſome. Whoſoeuer came at that time into Iudea, he was enforced to heare ſomewhat of the Meſſias: yea there was ſom fame of him ſpread through countries which were far of. Wherefore Cornelius muſt be put in the catalogue of the old fathers, who hoped for ſaluation of the redeemer before hee was reuealed. And it is properly ſaid of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine, that Peter grounded his faith: whereas it hadde nowe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a firme foundation: although Auguſtine thinketh as wee do in the thing it ſelfe, who affirmeth plainely that Cornelius coulde not pray vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe hee had faith: in his booke of the predeſtination of Sainctes and
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:7788:128" rendition="simple:additions"/> other places.</p>
               <p n="5">5 <hi>Now ſend to Ioppae.</hi> God dealt moſt fauourably with Cornelius in that he doth not commaund him to goe himſelf, but to ſend meſſengers vnto Peter, that he may ſtay quietly at home, &amp; that Peter may indure the toyle of the iourney for his ſake. But let vs not wonder that Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius was ſo courteouſly handled, ſeeing that God thruſteth the miniſters of his worde daily vpon the vnwilling: ſo that he appeareth of his accord to thoſe which doe not ſeeke him as he ſaith by Iſaias.<note place="margin">Iſa. 63.1.</note> But why doth not the Angell rather teache him? For this ſeemeth an inconuenient thing that he reſigneth his office to a mortall man: for the oracle ſhould haue had greater authoritie,<note place="margin">Acts. 9.10.</note> then when the goſpell is preached to him by a mortall man. As when Chriſt appeared to Paule by a viſion, hee ſet notwithſtanding Ananias to teach him, that he might by ſuch an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple eſtabliſh the miniſterie of the preaching of the goſpel, which he com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mitted to his church: ſo now the Angel giueth place to Peter, that hee may execute the office co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted vnto him by Chriſt. Therfore whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer will be the diſciple of Chriſt, &amp; be illuminate by the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly light of the heauenly wiſdome, let him not grudge to vſe attentiueneſſe and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitie toward the externall voyce of men, which Chriſte vſeth as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, and whereunto he will haue our faith annexed. And wee ſee how ſore God hath puniſhed their furious pride, who contemning prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, haue looked for reuelations from heauen. For ſithence God will be heard in men, the miniſters to whom he hath giuen his word cannot bee contemned without contempt and reproch of him.

And this was the cauſe that hee was ſo forwarde, becauſe hee beleeued the promiſe: as want of faith is the cauſe why we are ſo ſlowe to followe God.

                  <hi>Two of his ſeruants.</hi> Cornelius had this reward for beeing ſo diligent in teaching his family, that he had faithfull and honeſt ſeruauntes who were willing to do him ſeruice: and alſo ſuch as that he might co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit any thing to them. On the other ſide, the Lord doth oftentimes puniſh ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters with iuſt puniſhments, who haue no regarde to inſtruct their fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies. For they finde thoſe iuſtly ſtubborne and vnfaithfull, whome they would not frame vnto godlines and the feare of God, and alſo they are afraid of their treacherie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A godly ſouldiar.</hi> Foraſmuch as this ſouldiar was muche conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaunt with Cornelius, hee had alſo taught him to feare God, as well as his houſhold ſeruants. It is meete that we call to minde here, that which I touched before, That there is no kinde of life which excuſeth vs, but that we muſt worſhip god purely. For a ſouldiars life was at that time moſt corrupt, for they were fallen vnto filthie licentiouſneſſe, from the auncient diſcipline, and yet the Spirite of God beareth recorde in this place of the godlineſſe of ſouldiars. Wherefore there is no cauſe why they ſhoulde require a calling that is free from worſhipping God, vnder colour of warfare, who woulde by one meanes or other bee free from all righteouſneſſe. If they denie that they can ſerue God, becauſe they bee ſouldiars: they ſhal haue theſe two ſouldiars meete iudges and witneſſes againſt them at the laſt day, who ſhal condemne them. And in the mean ſeaſon thoſe brainſick felowes are condemned, who crie that it is vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for Chriſtians to carry weapons. For theſe men were warriours &amp; yet godly: &amp; when they embrace Chriſt, they forſake not their former kinde of life, they caſt not away their armour as hurtfull, ne yet forſake their calling.</p>
               <p n="8">8 Whereas Cornelius expoundeth the whole matter to the ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar and his ſeruants, it tendeth to this end, that he may the more encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage them to giue eare to the commandement, which they ſee is rather a commaundement of God tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of man: and he is not afraide to make knowen vnto them ſo great a matter, whom hee had inſtructed well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p n="10">10 <hi>On the morrow as they iourneied.</hi> As Luke declared that Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius was admoniſhed by an oracle to ſende for Peter: ſo nowe hee ſetteth
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:7788:129" rendition="simple:additions"/> downe another viſion, whereby Peter is commaunded to come to him. Whereby it appeareth that all this matter was gouerned by the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful counſel of God, who doth both make Cornelius apt to be taught, ye he kindleth in him a ſtudy &amp; deſire to learne, &amp; on the otherſide, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth Peter willing to take in hand to teach him. But wee muſt note the circumſtances whereby he maketh the hiſtorie more euident.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Peter went vppe vppon the houſe, that he may pray alone by him ſelfe.</hi> For a quiet and lone place, is a great help to praier, which thing Chriſt him ſelfe did not omit, that the minde being free fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all things which might call it away, might be the more earneſt and bent toward God. And the Iewes had another maner of houſes and buildings, then we vſe. For they had walkes vpon the toppes of their houſes. The ſixt houre was then noone. And it is not to be douted, but that he gate himſelf to prayer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> according to his cuſtome. For becauſe we are drawen away with diuers buſineſſes, and ther is no end of turmoyling, vnleſſe we bridle our ſelues: it is good to haue certaine houres appointed for prayer, not becauſe we are tyed to houres, but leaſt we be vnmindfull of prayer, which ought to be preferred before all cares and buſineſſe. Finally, we muſt think the ſame thing of time, which we think of place: to wit, that they are certain remedies wherby our infirmities is holpen. Which if the Apoſtles coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted fit for them, howe muche more muſt the ſluggiſhe and ſlow, vſe the ſame?</p>
               <p n="10">10 <hi>Exceſſe of minde.</hi> Becauſe our mindes are wholy as it were ſet vpon the earth, to the end Peter might the better comprehend the ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, it was meete that his minde ſhoulde bee as it were moued from his place and caried vp: and by this meanes was he prepared to receiue the oracle, when as he is carried vp aboue the world after an vnwonted ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
               <p n="11">11 The opening of heauen ſignifieth in my iudgement another thing in this place then in the ſeuenth chapter. For it is ſaide there, that heauen was opened to Steeuen, that he did behold the glory of Chriſte: in this place Peter ſaw our heauen which we ſee diuided, ſo that a ſheete came thence.</p>
               <p n="12">12 If any man aske, howe hee coulde ſee a great multitude of liuing creatures at once: the queſtion is eaſily anſwered. For Luke ſaith, <hi>All maner,</hi> becauſe there were there diuers kinds mixed one with another. Therefore he beginneth not at the firſt kind, that he may proſecute the number vnto the laſt. Againe, wee muſt not meaſure this ſeeing accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the manner of men: becauſe the traunce gaue Peter other eies. But before wee goe any farther, wee muſt knowe the ende of the viſion. Some diſpute more ſubtillie about the ſame, then the place requireth, in my iudgement. Therefore I thinke, that it is generallie ſhewed to Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that the difference which God hadde made in times paſt, is now ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away. And as he had put difference between liuing creatures: ſo ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing choſen to himſelfe one people, he counted all nations vncleane &amp; profane.</p>
               <p>Nowe the difference betweene liuing creatures beeing taken away,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:7788:130"/> he teacheth by the conſequent, that there is no ſuch diſagreeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g men any longer, as there was in times paſt, &amp; that there is no difference between the Iew and Grecian. Hereby Peter is admoniſhed, that he do not abhorre the Gentiles as being vncleane. Vndoutedly God meant to encorage Peter, to come to Cornelius without feare. But he had ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated one people to himſelfe from the reſt,<note place="margin">Deut. 32.9.</note> as ſaieth Moſes in his ſoung, when as the moſt higheſt did diſtribute the nations, he put his coarde in Iacob, &amp;c. Therefore he called it his inheritance &amp; peculiar people, according to this order, it had not been lawful for Peter to bring the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant of ſaluation vnto the Gentiles:<note place="margin">Mat. 15.27.</note> for that was to take the childrens bread, and to caſt it to dogges, vnleſſe peraduenture they would bee cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed and imbrace the Iewiſh religion.<note place="margin">Mat. 10.5.</note> For it was lawfull to receiue ſuch as did yeeld themſelues.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles. And foraſmuch as the preaching of the Goſpel is a moſt holie and weightie matter, Peter ought not to haue attempted any thing therein with a doubting and wauering minde, Therefore to the end he may bee aſſured of his calling, God ſheweth manifeſtly as in a picture, that the legall difference betwene the cleane and vncleane is aboliſhed:<note place="margin">Ephe. 2.14. Ephe. 3.9.</note> whence he may gather that the wall which was heretofore betweene the Iewes &amp; the Gentiles, is now pulled downe. And Paul ſaith, that it is a myſtery hid from the beginning of the world, that the Gentiles are made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the ſame ſaluation with the people of god, and ingraffed into one bodie.</p>
               <p>Therefore Peter durſt neuer haue opened the gate of heauen vnto the Gentiles, vnleſſe God himſelfe, had made a plain way and entrance for all men, by taking away the wall of ſeparation, I ſaid euen now, that there was no time wherin it was lawfull to admit the Gentiles vnto the worſhip of God, ſo they were circumciſed: but ſo long as they continued in vncircumciſion they were ſtraungers with God. But nowe GOD made the couenant of life common to all the whole world, which he had ſhut vp in one nation, as in a treaſure whence we gather, that this viſion is not a little profitable for vs. For when as it teacheth that the differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce between the Iewes and Gentiles continued onely for a ſeaſon: it is as much as if god ſhuld pronounce from heauen, that he receiued all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the worlde into fauour, that he may bee god ouer all.

They knew both the propheſies of the prophets, &amp; the late co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement of Chriſt concerning the calling of the Gentiles by the goſpel: but when they com to the puſh, they dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted neuertheleſſe, being ſtriken with ſtrangenes of the thing. Wherfore it is no maruel, if the Lord confirme Peter with a new ſigne, concerning

               <p n="13">13 <hi>A voice from heauen.</hi> The voice came from heauen as did the ſheet, that Peter might know that both came from God, neither had the ſight done him any good, vnleſſe God had with this voice made cleane thoſe things which were before vncleane. Whereas ſome pick an allegorie out of the word <hi>kill,</hi> as if God did ſignifie that men are ſacrificed to him by the ſpirituall ſword of the Goſpel, I do not proſecute that: but plainneſſe pleaſeth me better, that God doth take away by this voice, the law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the choiſe of beaſts, that he may alſo teach that he reiecteth no people. For if by the former word be meant <hi>ſacrificing,</hi>

               <p n="14">14 <hi>Not ſo Lord.</hi> This is the voice of him which doth as wel refuſe, as alſo obiect to god his own co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement. For he is afraid for good cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to touch that which he knew was forbidden him in the lawe of God. Therfore he obiecteth to god the law which he himſelfe made,<note place="margin">Leui. 11.21. &amp;c.</note> leaſt hee ſhould break the ſame vnaduiſedly. There was a certaine ſhew of repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy between the law &amp; the viſion. Therfore Peter is not haſty, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth firſt to haue his dout diſſolued, before he depart fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> obſeruing the law. Yet it is a ſtrange matter, why Peter reſiſted more in meats, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did Abraham in killing his ſonne: for Abraham had more things to obiect. I dare not here ſay that that befell Peter, which is too co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,<note place="margin">Gen. 22.9.10.</note> to ſtand more about outward &amp; ſmall matters, than about the chief points of the law: I rather make that anſwer which is out of dout, that Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s minde was ſo perſwaded, &amp; that he was furniſhed with ſuch power of the Spirit, that he ouercame with loftie &amp; heroicall fortitude al thoſe things which might haue hindered him: but the ſprite of god wrought ſlenderly in Peter. Whereby wee are taught, that euery ſmall or light thing doeth cauſe vs to doubt, vnleſſe the Lord do furniſh vs with counſell, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie to ouercome all fear. Yet Peter dealeth very godlilie &amp; very reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly, in that being in dout amidſt diuers cogitations, he dare doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, vntil it better appeare what he ought to follow. <hi>Common,</hi> ſignifieth in this place profane. For becauſe the Lord (as we haue ſaid) had choſen the Iewes to be a peculiar people, he had preſcribed vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this rite &amp; maner of liuing, that it might diſtinguiſh them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the profane gentiles. Therfore whatſoeuer the ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiles did vſe, contrary to the rule of the law, that did they call common: becauſe there was nothing pure or holy, but that which God had appointed for the vſe of his people.</p>
               <p n="15">15 <hi>Which God hath made cleane.</hi> He ſpeaketh of meats: but this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence muſt be extended vnto all partes of the life. It is worde for worde: <hi>That which God hath made cleane, do not thou make profane:</hi> but the ſenſe is, It is not for vs to allowe or condemne any thing, but as we ſtand and fal by the iudgement of god alone, ſo is hee iudge of all thinges. As touching meats, after the abrogating of the Law,<note place="margin">Rom. 14.4.</note> god pronounceth that they are all pure &amp; cleane. If on the other ſide there ſtart vp a mortall man, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a new difference, forbidding certaine, he taketh vnto himſelfe the authoritie and power of God by ſacrilegious boldneſſe. Of this ſtamp were the olde Heretikes, Montanus, Priſcillianus, the Donatiſtes, the
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:7788:131"/> Tatianes, and all the Eucratites. Afterwarde, the Pope, to the ende hee might binde all thoſe ſectes in a bundle, made a law concerning meats, and there is no cauſe why the Patrons of this impietie ſhoulde babble, that they doe not imagine any vncleanneſſe in meats, but that men are forbidden to eate fleſh vpon certaine dayes, to tame the fleſh. For ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they eate ſuch meates as are moſt fit both for delicacie and alſo for riot, why doe they abſtaine from eating bacon, as from ſome great of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, ſaue onely becauſe they imagine that that is vncleane and pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted which is forbidden by the lawe of their idoll? With like pride doth the tyrannie of the Pope rage in all partes of life: for there is nothing wherein hee layeth not ſnares to intangle the miſerable conſciences of men. But let vs truſt to the heauenly oracle, and freely deſpiſe all his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitions. Wee muſt alwayes aske the mouth of the Lorde, that wee may thereby be aſſured what we may lawfully doe: foraſmuch as it was not lawful euen for Peter to make that profane, which was lawful by the worde of God.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, this is a place of great importance to beate downe the frowardneſſe of men, which they vſe too much in peruerſe iudgementes. There is no man almoſt which doeth not graunt libertie to himſelfe to iudge of other mens doings. Now as we are churliſh and malicious, wee leane more toward the worſe part: ſo that we take from God that which is his. This voice alone ought to ſuffice to correct ſuch boldneſſe, That it is not lawfull for vs to make this or that vncleane: but that this power belongeth to God alone. And alſo in theſe wordes is giuen vs to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande, that the Iewes were not therefore the holy people of the Lord, becauſe they excelled through their owne worthineſſe, but only by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Gods adoption. Nowe after that GOD hadde receiued the Gentiles into the ſocietie of the Couenaunte, they haue all equall right.</p>
               <p n="16">16 <hi>This was done thriſe.</hi> The repetition of the viſion ſerued for the confirmation of Peter, leaſt any doubt ſhoulde remaine in his minde. Whence we gather, how deeply the obſeruing of the lawe was rooted in his minde. And I know no reaſon why God left him in a dumpe, vntil by the euent which followed he might learn the cauſe of the viſion, ſaue only becauſe being aſtonied, he did not deſire to know what this thing meant. Although it was all in good time, that the meſſengers of Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius ſhould come ſhortly after to interprete it.

               <p n="17">17 Peter was taught not only by the viſion, but alſo by the word of God: &amp; yet in ſeeing, he ſaw not, vntil the Spirit is vnto him an interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: a moſt excellent mirror of our ſlacknes. Althogh we be yet far vnlike to Peter: for we are ſo farre from vnderſtanding by &amp; by what God will, or to what end he ſpeaketh to vs, that many interpretations are ſcarce ſufficient for vs. But we muſt alſo note that which Luke addeth: that Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter did think earneſtly vpon the viſion: to wit, after that hee was come to himſelfe againe after his amazedneſſe: for this was a token of godlye reuerence, that he did not careleſly ſuffer the viſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to eſcape him. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord opened to him when he did knock.<note place="margin">Mat. 7.7.</note> And wee are iuſtly pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued for our ſluggiſhneſſe, in that we profit no better in the word of the Lorde, ſeeing we are ſo colde, and haue ſo ſmall deſire to enquire.</p>
               <p n="20">20 <hi>Goe, doubting nothing.</hi> The ſcripture vſeth this word often, when it will expreſſe of what ſort the obedience of faith ought to be. So Paule in the fourth chapt. to the Romanes,<note place="margin">Rom. 4.19. Rom. 14.23</note> when as he commendeth the faith of Abraham, ſaith: That he douted not when as the Lord promiſed him ſeed, being now aged, and paſt hope of children. And in the fourteenth intreating of meats, he condemneth douting conſciences. And it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to reaſon on both ſides (as they ſay): when as we are caried hither &amp; thither by courſe: by gathering contrary reaſons. But we muſt not fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low God with a doubfull &amp; wauering, but with a quiet &amp; conſtant mind. In ſumme, the Lord will haue vs to attribute ſo much to him, that when we heare him, we diſpute no longer what we haue need to doe: but that we ſet downe for a certaintie, that that muſt be done which he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth. And ſurely it is meet that his will ſhould ſhew vs the way, when all cloudes are driuen away, and that it ſhoulde ſubdue all our ſenſes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, vnto willing obedience, all reaſoning being broken of. Which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo better gathered by the next text. For the reaſon is added, why it is not lawfull for Peter to ſuſpend his iudgement in an vncertaine matter: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God is the authour of the buſineſſe, becauſe it is aſmuche as if it ſhould be ſaide, that we ought to bee content with the becke of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, that we may obey his commaundement.

For hee heareth that he is called by Cornelius, a man that is a Gentile, whom he would haue counted profane, and vnworthie of his companie, vnleſſe his iugdement had been correct with this voice, That which God calleth pure, iudge not thou to be common. This is to be wiſe in deed, when as abandoning all vain confidence, and correcting our ſtubbornneſſe, the authoritie of God doth ſo pul vs vnto it, &amp; doth ſo poſſeſſe our mindes, that we count nothing right, but that which it preſcribeth.</p>
               <p n="22">22 <hi>Cornelius a iust man.</hi> Cornelius his ſeruants commende their maſter not ambitiouſly, or to the end they may flatter him: but that Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may the leſſe abhor his company. And for this cauſe they ſay that he was approued of the Iewes, that Peter may know that he was not eſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from true and ſincere godlineſſe. For euen theſe which were ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious, though they ſerued Idols, did boaſt that they were worſhippers of God. But Cornelius coulde not haue the Iewes who retained the worſhip of the true God alone, to be witneſſes of his godlines, vnleſſe he had profeſſed that he worſhipped the God of Abraham with them. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, as this was a rare example, ſo it ought to haue moued Peter not a little. Although they leane moſt of all to this argument, that they may perſwade him that which they goe about, that all this matter is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned by the commandement of God: as if they ſhould ſay, That hee is not ſo much called by a mortal man, as by God, who had ſo commanded by his angell.</p>
               <p n="23">23 And Peter alſo being ouercome with the authoritie of God, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberateth no longer, but lodgeth the men, that hee may go with them foorthwith.

<pb n="247" facs="tcp:7788:132"/> before night: becauſe they were not as yet entred the citie at noone: and the viſion which was ſhewed thriſe asked no ſmall time. Therfore when they had taken their reſt all night, they addreſſe themſelues to return. Againe, this was a point of curteſie in that ſome of the faithfull doe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany Peter, who were ſent as it is to be thought, by the whole church, to bring him euen to Ceſarea.

So that they are bountifully rewarded for their thankfulneſſe, when as for confirmation of their faith, they ſee the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Chriſt ſpread abroad euen vnto the Gentiles.</p>
               <p n="24">24 <hi>Cornelius waited for them.</hi> Luke doth not only co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affection of Cornelius in this point, that he wayted earneſtly for Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming, but becauſe he would haue his friendes &amp; kinsfolkes to bee co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s with him in the faith. This was a thing not without great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, to call together a companie of men, that they might imbrace a new kinde of religion. And there wanted not reaſons, vnder colour whereof he might haue flattered himſelf. For he was not commaunded to call o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to accompanie him, but rather they were paſſed ouer, and he him ſelf was choſen to be made partaker of ſo great goodneſſe: but hee conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered with himſelfe, howe much hee was indebted both to the glory of God, &amp; alſo to the ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his brethren: he knew that it was an vniuſt thing, &amp; a point of diſcourteſie to prouide for himſelfe alone, &amp; not to regarde others: he counted it a point of filthie careleſneſſe, to hide the treaſure of the Goſpel vnder the ground. Therfore he did that which the Lord requireth of all his by Iſaias and Micheas, that euery one exhorte his brother (taking him as it were by the hand) vnto the faith. Therfore Cornelius hath taught vs by his example, that when God reuealeth him ſelf vnto vs, we muſt not choke the light of this knowledge with ſloth or fear: but we muſt rather indeuour that our faith may ſhine before others to giue light, &amp; to ſhew the way to them. For the inherita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen is not ſuch, that euen the leaſt portion can be taken fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs, if many bee made partakers thereof, but if others bee made coheires with vs, it ſhall rather increaſe our glory. Furthermore, wee muſt marke how far he is from vain glory. For he calleth them that he may haue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be his ſchoole felowes, being himſelf readie to learne. This is the true ſtudie of godlineſſe, when as togeather with zeale there appeareth ſuch plainneſſe, that we are not aſhamed to depend vpon the mouth of God. For many are pricked forward with ambition, to imploy themſelues in teaching the ignorant, &amp; fooliſh babling diſcouereth their folly, when as they hudle out words more earneſtly, &amp; they wold haue none heard but the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues. But this alone ought to be the drift of all men, to bring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues &amp; al the whole world vnder god, that when men are ſubdued vnto true humilitie, he alone may haue the prehemine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. Let not him which excelleth in the faculty &amp; grace of teaching, refuſe to teach his brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſo that he be free from boaſting and proude deſire to excell: let him to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it was not graunted to be a teacher, keep himſelf within his bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds: let neither of them deſire maſterſhip: as Iames teacheth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but let one
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:7788:133"/> ſo edifie another, that neither the learned, neither the vnlearned bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to be brought into order. Notwithſtanding it is demanded, what kinsfolkes he could haue in Iudea, ſeeing that he was an aliaunt, &amp; was come thither only by reaſon of warre, which continued but for a ſhorte time? As I affirme nothing, ſo I embrace this as moſt probable, That hee had ſome in his garriſon which were his kinſmen. For neighbors &amp; thoſe which were of acquaintance, were wont to ſerue vnder one captain. And we need not doubt of this but that Cornelius his kinſmen were deſirous to be vnder him, foraſmuch as he was a centurion. Hee calleth familiar friends <hi>Anagcaious,</hi> as thoſe are called of the Latines, <hi>Neceſſarii,</hi> whiche are neerer together.</p>
               <p n="25">25 <hi>Falling downe at his feete, he worſhipped.</hi> Here is the worde <hi>proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuneſen,</hi> which ſignifieth to teſtifie honour or worſhip, either by bowing the knee, or ducking downe the head, or by any other geſture. Nowe the queſtion is whether Peter refuſeth this worſhip for modeſties ſake only, or he diſaloweth it as a thing altogether vnlawfull? It appeareth that Cornelius his fact diſpleaſed Peter, by the reaſon which is by and by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: <hi>Ariſe,</hi> for euen I am a man. For we may gather that there was ſome diuine thing in that worſhip, becauſe hee did aſcribe vnto mortall man the honour which is due to God alone. But we muſt not think that Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius did count Peter in ſteed of God. For if he tranſlated Gods honor vnto mortall man, where is that godlineſſe and religion, with the title whereof he was of late adourned? Therefore I thinke that he meant no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſſe then to ſpoyle God of his lawfull worſhip, that he might giue it to man, but foraſmuch as he meant to giue ſingular honour vnto the prophet and Apoſtle of Chriſt, hee fell into an immoderate token of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence, and ſo he offended in exceſſe. For it can ſcarce bee expreſſed in wordes, how prone men are to fall to ſuperſtition, when as that honour is giuen to the miniſters of Chriſt, which hath any ſmall ſhew of diuine worſhippe. For we fall eaſily vnwares into that, whereof we thought full little. There were leſſe daunger in a king or in the chiefe chieftanes of this worlde. For he which falleth downe before a king, keepeth himſelfe within the boundes of earthly and ciuill honour: but the caſe ſtandeth otherwiſe in the miniſters of Chriſt. For as their office is ſpirituall, ſo if any man fall downe at their feete, to worſhip them, this honour hath in it ſome ſpirituall thing. For wee muſt put a difference betweene ciuill worſhip which men vſe among themſelues in reſpect of ciuill order, and that vnder which is contained religion, or which reſpecteth directlye the honour of God: as alſo between lawes which are made for tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall regiment, or which binde the conſcience. For certaine fooliſh men are deceiued too farre, who think that kneeling is in this place condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſimplie and of it ſelfe. But this is that which I ſaid: Cornelius doth not heere ſalute his Proconſull or the Emperour after any ciuill ſorte: but being ſtriken with wondering when hee ſawe Peter, hee honoureth him, as he woulde haue honoured God, if he had been preſent. So that he giueth man more then is meet, hauing as it were forgotten himſelfe. He thought nothing leſſe (as I haue alreadie ſaid) then to robbe GOD
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:7788:133"/> of any part of his honour, that hee might giue that to man which hee tooke from him: but when as the worſhippe which is giuen to man hath ſomewhat which is as it were linked with the honour of God, men fall into a fault contrary to their hope and opinion, ſo that they extoll man aboue his degree and giue him the worſhip which is due to God. The Papiſts omitting that deſtinction, ſnatch onely at one member, for they handle religious worſhip onely: to the ende they may aſcribe ſome part thereof with ſome honeſt colour vnto creatures, they cut it into <hi>latriam, duliam,</hi> &amp; <hi>hyperduliam.</hi> They giue <hi>latriam</hi> to God alone: as if they ſhould ſay that the adoration of worſhip is due to him alone, they make <hi>duliam</hi> common to the dead and their bones, to images and pictures. They aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne their <hi>hyper duliam</hi> to the virgine Marie, and to the croſſe whereon Chriſt hanged. That I may omit to ſay that they bable through childiſh ignorance, how many of them doe vnderſtande that rotten diſtinction? neither doe I ſpeake onely of the common ſort, but of the chiefetaines. Therefore all their worſhipings muſt needs be infected &amp; corrupt with wicked ſuperſtition, ſeing they vnaduiſedly match creatures with God. But Luke ſaieth not in this place, that Cornelius gaue to Peter <hi>latriam</hi> or the honour due to God: he vſeth onely the general word <hi>worſhipped,</hi> and he addeth notwithſtanding, that he was reproued, becauſe hee did wickedly extoll man higher than became him. Surely if that new opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion concerning the adoration which is called <hi>dulica</hi> had any place, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ought to haue admoniſhed Cornelius, that he ſhould not go beyond <hi>duliam.</hi> But becauſe no worſhip whereunto religion is annexed and the reſpect of Gods honour, doth leaue to God his honour vntouched, what name ſoeuer it haue: therefore Peter is content with this one onely rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that he is a man. Moreouer I would gladly know of the Papiſts, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they thinke that Iohn was ſo blockiſh, that hee woulde take the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour due to God which they call <hi>latriam,</hi> and giue it to the Angell? Surely there was nothing elſe that cauſed him to worſhippe the Angel ſaue onely too much and prepoſterous reuerence, and that in honor of God whoſe glory ſhined in the Angel: notwithſtanding his fact is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned. Therefore to the end we may giue God that which is his owne, let the ſpiritual worſhip vnder which is comprehended religion, remain whole and ſound to him.</p>
               <p n="28">28 <hi>Yee know, that it is not lawfull.</hi> This ſeemeth to be no friendly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, and ſuch as may rather harden then winne their heartes, when as they heare that they are accounted ſo vncleane, that with their famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity &amp; conference they pollute the ſaints: which muſt needs be a great reproch for them. But it was needfull for Peter thus to ſpeake, leaſt they ſhould ſuſpect that he had an euill conſcience, becauſe contrarie to the cuſtome deliuered by the fathers, he came. But when as hee affirmeth that hee was ſent of God, all ſuch ſuſpition is taken away and purged. Moreouer hee mitigateth very well by theſe wordes, the offence which did ſticke in their minds, by reaſon of an old grudge which was between the Iewes and the Gentiles, ſo that he could by no meanes haue entred his ſpeech better. For he pronounceth that thoſe are nowe cleane who
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:7788:134"/> were before vncleane, ſo that they haue mutuall fellowſhip nowe with the ſaints. Furthermore where as he ſaid that it was wickedneſſe for the Iewes to go in vnto the Gentiles, wee muſt knowe that this came not ſo much from the lawe, as from the obſeruation of the fathers God had forbidden in deed that they ſhould not intangle themſelues with mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages or couenants:<note place="margin">Deut. 7.3.</note> they were neuer forbidden to eate with them, or to vſe the common buſineſſes of life But leaſt that familiaritie might intiſe them vnto that which was forbidden, they obſerued the cuſtome deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered by the fathers, ſo that they did not company togither. It is to no end to diſpute here, whether that tradition did binde mens conſciences: for Peter doth not teach what is lawfull according to God, but what was commonly vſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>No man.</hi> He maketh the ſumme and ende of the viſion more plaine, when hee referreth that vnto men which was ſpoken of meates. And whereas he ſaith that no man is vncleane, it may not be vnderſtood of all particular perſons, for it is certaine that al vnbeleeuers are polluted with vncleanneſſe of conſcience, ſo that they pollute thoſe things which are otherwiſe pure, when as they do but touch them. Paul alſo ſaith that their children remaine vncleane, vntil they be cleanſed by faith. Finally if faith alone doe purge and purifie the hearts of men, vnbeliefe doeth make the ſame prophane. But Peter compareth the Iewes and the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles togither in this place: and becauſe the wall of ſeparation was pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led downe, and the couenant of life is nowe common to them both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, he ſaith that thoſe are not to be counted aliants, who are made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of Gods adoption.</p>
               <p n="29">29 We muſt alſo note that which hee addeth that he came without gaineſaying. For this is the holy ſilence of faith, when as without mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring againſt God, we receiue that meekely, which he commandeth abandoning all contrary reaſons, which intrude themſelues.</p>

               <p>Becauſe this anſwere of Cornelius containeth onely the bare repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the hiſtorie, I ſhall not need to ſtand long about that. The ſum is, that he called Peter at the commandement of God.</p>
               <p n="30">30 <hi>I was fasting.</hi> Many greeke bookes haue <hi>emen,</hi> I ſate. The olde in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter omitteth the word Faſting: which I thinke was done through

Furthermore hee maketh expreſſe mention of faſting, partly that wee may know that he praied not coldly, or ouerfields at that time: ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the viſion may be the leſſe ſuſpected. For doubtleſſe the braine of a man that is faſting (where there is moderate ſobrietie) doeth not eaſily admit anie ſtrong imaginations wherein appeare images and ſtrange formes, whereby men are diſceiued. Therefore Cornelius his meaning is that he was earneſtly bent to pray, at ſuch time as the Angel appeared to him, and that his minde was free from all ſuch lets which vſe to make men ſubiect to fantaſies, &amp; imaginations.

                  <hi>A man ſtoode in ſhining garment.</hi> Hee calleth him a man, who he knew was an Angel of God, but it is a common thing for the name of the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble forme wherein God or his Angels appeare, to bee tranſlated vnto him or them. So Moſes doth ſometimes cal them Angels, &amp; ſometimes men, which appeared to Abraham in ſhape of men. The ſhining gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was a token of heauenly glory, and as it were a ſigne of the diuine maieſty which appeared in the Angel. The Euangiliſtes declare that there was ſuch brightnes in Chriſts garment, when he ſhewed his glory to the three diſciples in the mount. The ſame thing do they witneſſe of the Angels which were ſent to teſtifie Chriſtes reſurrection. For as the Lord beareth with our infirmitie, thus farre that hee commaundeth his Angels to deſcend vnder forme of our fleſh, ſo he caſteth out vpon them certaine beames of his glory, that the commandements which he hath committed to them, may be the more reuerenced and beleeued. Heere ariſeth a queſtion, whether that were a true and naturall bodie, &amp; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that were a garment in deed, or Cornelius did only ſee ſuch a ſhape and ſhew. And though this be not ſo neceſſarie to bee knowne, and wee can ſcarſe affirme any thing for a truth: yet it ſeemeth to me more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable as touching coniecture, that God to whom it belongeth to create all things, gaue to the Angel a true body, and did cloath the ſame with a moſt gorgeous garment. But ſo ſoone as the Angel had ended his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſage, I thinke he was reſtored to his owne nature, the body and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being brought to nought: and that hee ſuffered no humane thing, ſo long as he was in the ſhape of man.</p>
               <p n="33">33 <hi>Therefore we are all now preſent.</hi> To the end Peter may be more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and willing to teach, Cornelius affirmeth that himſelfe and the reſt will be apt to bee taught, and ready to obey God: for this ſerueth not a litle to moue the teacher to take paines with the hearers: when as hee hopeth aſſuredly that they ſhall profite thereby. Theſe words <hi>before God</hi> may haue a double meaning, they may either be an oath, or Cornelius may thereby ſimply profeſſe, that that company was gathered togither at his houſe, as in the ſight of God, that they may heare mans voyce in like ſort, as if it proceeded out of Gods owne mouth. Whether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer you chooſe, there ſhalbe alwaies one end. For to the end Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius may the more procure the credite of his ſynceritie, he teſtifieth
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:7788:135" rendition="simple:additions"/> that he hath God before his eyes, whom no man may mock by diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. And aſſuredly ſo ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as the word of God is ſet before vs, we muſt thus thinke with our ſelues, that wee haue not to deale with a mortall man, but that God is preſent and doth call vs. For from this reſpect of God ariſeth the maieſtie of Gods worde, and reuerence in hearing the ſame. Notwithſtanding he ſeemeth to promiſe vnaduiſedly for others in a matter ſo weightie, for who can be a fit borrow for another mans faith? But becauſe euery man had promiſed obedience for himſelfe, hee doth for good cauſes hope that they were ſo affectioned: and vndoubtedly we may thinke that they had promiſed that they would bee obedient to his ſayings ſo ſoone as the matter was ſhewed them, and that euen then euery one confirmed by himſelf that which one had ſpoken in the name of all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To heare all things.</hi> This only is true faith when wee embrace not the one halfe of the worde of God alone, but addict our ſelues wholly vnto it: and yet notwithſtanding there bee few examples in the world of this full and vniuerſall faith. For the more part doth not ſubmit themſelues to the doctrine of God, as if they had made a couenant with God, ſaue onely ſo farre forth as it pleaſeth them: if any thing diſpleaſe them they either careleſly contemne or miſlike the ſame. But Cornelius doth wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtinguiſh betweene God and man: for he maketh God the authour of the doctrine, and leaueth nothing for man beſides the miniſtery and embaſſage. Thou ſhalt ſaith he, haue attentiue ſcholars, and thoſe which will be obedient in all things, which God hath commaunded thee: that he alone may be principall, and thou onely his miniſter: that hee alone may ſpeake, but out of thy mouth.

                  <hi>In truth I finde. Catalamuanesthai</hi> is to apprehend, or to gather by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, ſignes and coniectures. Cornelius was a Gentile borne: yet God heareth his prayers, hee vouchſafeth to ſhew him the light of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, hee appointed and ſendeth an Angel to him particularly: thereby doth Peter know, that without reſpect of perſons thoſe doe pleaſe God, which liue godlily and innocently. For before (being wholly poſſeſt with this preiudice, that the Iewes alone were beloued of God, as they alone were choſen out of all people) he did not thinke that the grace of god could come vnto others. He was not ſo groſſe, that he thought that godlines &amp; innocencie of life were condemned, becauſe they were in a man that was a Gentile: but ſeing he did ſimplie ſnatch at that, that all thoſe were eſtraunged from the kingdome of God and were prophane which were vncircumciſed, hee intangled himſelfe vnawares in that ſo filthy an errour, that God did deſpiſe his pure worſhip and an holy life, where there was no circumciſion, becauſe vncircumciſion made al ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues vnſauery to the Iewes. By which example we are taught, how great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we ought to beware of preiudices, which make vs oftentimes iudge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe. Furthermore we muſt note what the word <hi>perſon</hi> doeth ſignifie: becauſe many are thereby deceiued, whiles that they expounde it gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, that one man is not preferred before another. So Pelagius denied in times paſt that ſome are choſen and ſome are proued of God: becauſe God did not accept perſons. But by this word wee muſt vnderſtand the externall ſtate or appearance as they call it: and whatſoeuer is about man himſelfe, which doeth either bring him in fauour, or cauſe him to be hated: riches, nobilitie, multitude of ſeruants, honour doe make a man to be in great fauour: pouertie, baſenes of linage, &amp; ſuch like things make him to be deſpiſed. In this reſpect, the Lord doth oftentimes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid the accepting of perſons: becauſe men cannot iudge aright, ſo often as external reſpects do lead them away from the matter. In this place it is referred vnto the nation: and the meaning is: that vncircumciſion is no let, but that God may allow righteouſnes in a man that is a Gentile. But it ſhall ſeeme by this meanes that God did reſpect perſons for a time. For when as he did chooſe the Iewes to be his people, paſſing ouer the Gentiles, did hee not reſpect perſons? I aunſwere that the cauſe of this difference, ought not to be ſought in the perſons of men: but it doth wholly depende vpon the hidden counſel of God. For in that he rather adopted Abraham, that with him hee might make his couenant, then the Aegyptians, he did not this being moued with any external reſpect, but all the whole cauſe remained in his wonderfull counſell. Therefore God was neuer tyed to perſons. Notwithſtanding the doubte is not as yet diſſolued: becauſe it cannot be denied, but that circumciſion did pleaſe God, ſo that he counted him one of his people, who had that to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of ſanctification. But we may eaſily anſwere this alſo, That circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion followed after the grace of god, foraſmuch as it was a ſeale there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Whereuppon it followeth that it was no cauſe thereof. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe it was vnto the Iewes a pledge of free adoption in ſuch ſort, that vncircumciſion did not hinder God, but that hee might admitte what
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:7788:136"/> Gentiles he would, vnto the ſociety of the ſame ſaluation. But the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Chriſt had this new and eſpeciall thing, that after that the wall of ſeparation was pulled downe, God did embrace the whole world ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally. And this doe the words <hi>in euery nation</hi> import. For ſo long as A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams ſeede was the holy inheritance of God,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 2.14.</note> the Gentiles might ſeeme to be quite baniſhed from his kingdome. But when Chriſt was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to be a light of the Gentiles, the couenant of eternall life, began to be common to all alike.</p>
               <p n="35">35 <hi>He which feareth God and doth righteouſneſſe.</hi> In theſe two members is comprehended the integritie of all the whole life. For the feare of God is nothing elſe but godlineſſe and religion: and <hi>righteouſnes,</hi> is that equitie which men vſe among themſelues, taking heede leaſt they hurt any man, and ſtudying to do good to all men. As the law of God conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth vppon theſe two parts (which is the rule of good life): ſo no man ſhal proue himſelfe to God, but he which ſhal refer &amp; direct all his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to this end, neither ſhal ther be any ſound thing in al offices, vnleſſe the whole life be grounded in the feare of God. But it ſeemeth that this place doth attribute the cauſe of ſaluation vnto the merits of works. For if works purchaſe fauor for vs with god, they do alſo win life for vs, which is placed in the loue of God towards vs. Some do alſo catch at the word <hi>righteouſnes,</hi> that they may proue that we are not iuſtified freely by faith, but by workes. But this latter thing is too friuolous. For I haue already ſhewed, that it is not taken for the perfit and whole obſeruing of the law, but is reſtrained vnto the ſecond table, and the offices of loue: therefore it is not the vniuerſall righteouſnes, whereby a man is iudged iuſt before God: but that honeſty &amp; innocency which reſpecteth men, when as that is giuen to euery man which is his. Therfore the queſtion remaineth as yet, whether works win the fauor of God for vs? Which that we may an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, we muſt firſt note, that there is a double reſpect of God in louing men. For ſeing we be borne the children of wrath, god ſhalbe ſo far from finding any thing in vs, which is worthy of his loue, that al our whole na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture cauſeth him rather to hate vs, in which reſpect Paul ſaith that al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are enimies to him,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 2.3. Rom. 5.6.8.</note> vntil they be reconciled by Chriſt. Therfore the firſt accepting of God, wherby he receiueth vs into fauour, is altogither free: for there can as yet no reſpect of works be had, ſeing all things are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and wicked, and taſte of their beginning. Now whom God hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted to be his children, them doth he alſo regenerate by his Spirit, &amp; reforme in them his image: whence riſeth that ſecond reſpect. For God doth not finde man bare and naked then, and voide of all grace: but he knoweth his own work in him, yea himſelf. Therfore God accepteth the faithful, becauſe they liue godlily and iuſtly. And we doe not denie, that God accepteth the good works of the ſaints: but this is another queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Whether man preuent the grace of God with his merits or no, and inſinuate himſelfe into his loue: or whether he be beloued at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning freely and without reſpect of workes, foraſmuch as he is worthy of nothing elſe but of hatred. Furthermore foraſmuch as man left to his owne nature, can bring nothing but matter of hatred, he muſt needs co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that hee is freely beloued: whereupon it followeth that God is to
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:7788:136" rendition="simple:additions"/> himſelf the cauſe that he loueth vs: and that he is prouoked with his own mercy, and not with our merits. Secondly, we muſt note, that although the faithful pleaſe God after regeneration with goods works, &amp; their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of works, yet that is not done with the merit of works. For the clean<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes of works is neuer ſo exact, that they can pleaſe God without pardon: yea foraſmuch as they haue alwaies ſome corruption mixed with them, they are worthy to be refuſed. Therfore the worthines of the works, doth not cauſe them to be had in eſtimation but faith, which borroweth that of Chriſt which is wanting in works.</p>
               <p n="36">36 <hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the matter.</hi> Becauſe the greek text is abrupt, ſome think that the Accuſatiue caſe is put in ſteede of the Nominatiue: &amp; that the ſenſe is this, This is the word which God hath ſent vnto the children of Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el. Otherſome refer it vnto the word <hi>ye know,</hi> which followeth afterward: &amp; they think that there was another word added, to make the ſentence more pleaſant.

Therfore I take this member to be a preface, which appertaineth vnto this worthy worke of God, which he ſhewed amongſt the children of Iſrael, preaching peace by Chriſt: that done there is added a narration: at length in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluſion of his ſpeech, Peter ſheweth to what end Chriſt was ſent into the world. Furthermore he beginneth with this commemoration not without cauſe, That God ſent his word vnto the children of Iſrael. And Speech is put for Thing in the Hebrew phraſe. The eternall couenant which God had made with that people, was at that time famous. There was nothing more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly knowne amongſt the Iewes, than that there was a redeemer promiſed in times paſt to the fathers, who ſhould reſtore things which were decaied, vnto a floriſhing and bleſſed eſtate. This did thoſe alſo know, who were familiarly conuerſant with the Iewes. Therefore to the ende Peter may purchaſe greater credit, he ſaith that he wil ſpeak of no new or vnknown thing, but of the reſtoring of the, Church which did depend vppon the eternall couenant of God, and which was nowe manifeſtly ſhewed: and almoſt in euery mans mouth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Preaching peace.</hi> Peter teacheth here what maner rumour &amp; thing that was which was ſpread abroad: to wit, ſuch as that it did make peace.

Therfore this is Peter his meaning, that god ſhewed himſelf merciful to his people in Chriſt, &amp; that he receiued into fauor Abraham his children again, (whom he ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to haue caſt away for a time) that he might eſtabliſh among them a floriſhing eſtate. And as he maketh God the author of this peace, ſo he placeth Chriſt in the mids, as the pledge therof, that it may be certain &amp; holy. He coupleth peace and preaching expreſly togither, becauſe this
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:7788:137"/> is one way whereby the fruite of the reconciliation purchaſed by Chriſt commeth vnto vs.<note place="margin">Epheſ. 2.17.</note> In like ſort after that Paul hath taught that Chriſt is our peace, he addeth immediatly, that hee came to preach peace vnto thoſe who were nigh at hand and farre off.</p>
               <p n="37">37 <hi>Ye know howe the word.</hi> This ſermon of Peter conſiſteth vppon two members principally: for in the former he reciteth an hiſtorie: ſecondly he diſcendeth vnto the fruit of the hiſtorie. For ſeing that the comming of Chriſt into the world, his death and reſurrection, are the matter of our ſaluation, Chriſt cannot otherwiſe be ſet before vs to ſaluation, than if we firſt know that hee hath put on our fleſh, that hee was in ſuch ſort conuerſant amongſt men, that he proued himſelfe by certaine teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies to be the ſon of God: that he was at length nailed vpon the croſſe, and raiſed vp from the deade by the power of God. Againe leaſt the knowledge of the hiſtorie be vnprofitable and colde, we muſt alſo ſhewe the end, why he came downe from his heauenly glorie into the worlde, why he ſuffered ſuch a death ſo reprochfull amongſt men, and accurſed by the mouth of God. The cauſe of his reſurrection muſt bee ſhewed, whence the effect and fruite of all theſe things is gathered: to wit, that Chriſt was humbled, that he might reſtore vs vnto perfite bleſſedneſſe, who were quite loſt:<note place="margin">Iſai. 53.4.</note> and alſo that hee put on brotherly loue togither with our fleſh: that by taking vpon him our infirmities, hee vnburdened vs thereof: that hee made ſatisfaction for our ſinnes by the ſacrifice of his death that he might purchaſe the fathers fauor for vs: that when as he had gotten the victorie of death, he purchaſed for vs eternall life: that hee ſet heauen open for vs by his entrance into the ſame: that all the power of the Spirit was powred out vpon him, that he might enrich vs with his abundance. This order of teaching doth Peter obſerue, when hee beginneth with the hiſtory of the goſpel: and afterward ſheweth, what we haue by Chriſt his deſcending into the earth, by his death and reſurrection. Firſt he ſaith, that Ieſus of Nazareth came abroade after Iohn his Baptiſme. For becauſe Iohn was appointed to this end, by the counſell of God, that he might lift vp the mindes of the people to waite for Chriſt, it was not meete that this point ſhould be omitted. Hee was counted an excellent Prophet of God: therefore his authoritie was of great importance to make Chriſt to be beleeued, eſpecially amongſt the ignorant and thoſe which were but nouices. We muſt note the phraſe, that Iohn preached Baptiſme. For Luke comprehendeth in deed, vnder the worde <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> all the whole miniſtery of Iohn: neuertheleſſe hee ſheweth that it was no dumb ſigne, and voide of doctrine. And aſſuredly this is the chiefeſt thing in all ſacraments, that the worde of God may appeare ingrauen ther, and that the cleare voice may ſound. For which cauſe that wicked profanation which is ſeene in papiſtrie is ſo much the more to be deteſted, becauſe burying, preaching, they do onely chamre the ſacraments with magical inchantment.</p>
               <p n="38">38 <hi>Ieſus of Nazareth.</hi> He calleth him a Nazarite here, not becauſe he was borne there, but becauſe hee came thence to execute his office. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine becauſe he was ſurnamed thus commonly. He ſaith that hee was
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:7788:137" rendition="simple:additions"/> annointed with the Spirite and power by hypallage. For the power wherein Chriſt exceeded proceeded from the Spirite alone. Therefore when as the heauenly father annointed his ſon, hee furniſhed him with the power of his Spirit. Peter ſaith immediatly after, that this power ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in myracles: although hee expreſſeth one kinde onely in plaine words, that Chriſt teſtified, that he was endewed with power of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, that he might do good in the world. For it was not meete that the fearefull power of God ſhould bee ſhewed forth in him: but ſuch as might allure the worlde with the ſweete taſt of goodneſſe and grace to loue him and to deſire him. The metaphore of Annointing is vſuall ſo often as mention is made of the gifts of the holy ghoſt: it is now applied vnto the perſon of Chriſt: becauſe by this meanes he was conſecrated a king and Prieſt by his father. And we know that in time of the Law oile was a ſolemne token of conſecration. The Going of Chriſt is taken for the courſe of his calling: as if he ſhould ſay that he fulfilled his function vntil the time appointed before. The ſimilitude is taken from trauellers which go forward in their iorney, vntill they come vnto the appointed place. Although he ſheweth therewithall that he walked through Iudea in three yeeres, ſo that no corner was without his good deeds.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thoſe which were holden of Diuils.</hi> This alſo was a more manifeſt token of Gods power in Chriſt, that hee did not onely heale men of common diſeaſes, but did alſo cure deſperate euils. All diſeaſes are in deede light puniſhments wherewith God doth puniſh vs: but when as hee dealeth more gently with vs according to his fatherly kindneſſe, hee is ſaide to ſtrike vs with his hand then: but in more greeuous ſcourges hee vſeth Satan as the miniſter of his wrath, and as it were an hangman. And wee muſt diligently marke this diſtinction: for it were an abſurd thing to ſay that he is tormented of the diuell who is ſicke of an Ague or of ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther common kinde of diſeaſe: but the alienating of the minde, furious madneſſe, and other as it were monſtrous griefes, are fitly and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attributed to Satan. And in this reſpect the ſcripture vſeth to cal men who are ſo taken and carried headlong with ſuch madneſſe that they haue no hold of themſelues, ſo that they ſeeme to be turned almoſt into beaſtes, men poſſeſſed of diuels.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Becauſe God was with him.</hi> Peter noteth briefly to what end thoſe pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers did tende which were ſhewed by the hande of Chriſt: to wit, that he might purchaſe credite among men, who did behold God as it were preſent: and this was the true vſe of myracles, as wee haue ſaide alredie elſe where, and as we ſhal ſee againe hereafter when we come to it. For we muſt ſtay our ſelues vpon this principle, that we diminiſh the maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie of God, vnleſſe we imbrace and reuerence thoſe whom he marketh with the marke of his ſeruauntes. Therefore foraſmuch as powers did plainely proue that Chriſt deſcended from heauen, his dignitie is pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced without the lot of mans iudgement.</p>

Shortly after he taketh the word <hi>witneſſe</hi> in another ſenſe: when he ſaith, that they were appointed witneſſes by God, and that they are brought foorth as it were by God, that they might by their preaching bring men vnto the faith of Chriſt. So Paule in the fifteenth of the firſt to the Corinthians ſaith: we, ſaieth hee ſhoulde bee founde falſe witneſſes, vnleſſe Chriſt were riſen from the deade. And wee haue alreadie heard by the mouth of Chriſt, yee ſhall be my witneſſes in Iudea, Samaria and at Ieruſalem. And now Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter calleth himſelfe onely an hiſtoricall witneſſe, becauſe he beheld the things which were done. And here he toucheth his death briefely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was openly knowne: he ſtandeth longer vpon his reſurrection, which was more doubtful, and the knowledge whereof was more auaile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able vnto faith.</p>
               <p n="41">41 If any man demaunde heere, Why God did not ſhewe his ſonne openly to al men after his reſurrection: I anſwere, Although there could no reaſon bee ſhewed, yet ought the counſell of God alone to ſuffice ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and modeſt men, that they may aſſure themſelues without al doubt that that is beſt which God hath thought meet. And yet aſſuredly God vſed this moderation to a good ende. For the certaintie of the reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction was proued by many and firme teſtimonies, and this was profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to exerciſe the faith of the godly, to beleeue the Goſpel rather than their eies. As touching the wicked and profeſſed enimies of Chriſt, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that being ſo often conuict they woulde neuer yeelde to God, they were vnworthy to haue Chriſt to admit them to behold the glorie of his reſurrection. Though euen they were ſufficiently conuict with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the ſoldiars, whom they had hyred to keepe the ſepulchre: that I may omitte other reaſons which wee may fet out of the Harmonie. Therefore let vs aſſure our ſelues of this, that the holy Apoſtles were choſen by the holy decree of God, that by their teſtimonie the trueth of Chriſt his reſurrection might ſtande. Whoſoeuer is not content with this approbation, let him take away and ouerthrow if he can, that inuio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable decree of God, which Peter commendeth to vs in this place. And as for vs if we couet to haue God the ſure authour of our faith, let vs learne to bee content with the witneſſes, whom in due time hee hath brought forth as it were by his hande, being ordained by him before the world was made.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Who did eate.</hi> And here it appeareth what great regard Chriſt had of our rudeneſſe and ignorance, who did abaſe himſelfe ſo farre for our ſake, that when he was now endewed with heauenly glorie, hee did yet notwithſtanding eate and drinke as a mortall man. Wherefore there is no cauſe why wee ſhoulde complaine that the reſurrection of Chriſt is obſcure and doubtfull. For he ſuffered his diſciples to be ſlow and hard of beliefe for this cauſe, that being better confirmed, they might take from vs all occaſion of doubting. Yea rather wee muſt indeuour our ſelues that our vnworthineſſe and vnthankfulneſſe doe not darken ſo great kindneſſe of the ſonne of God toward vs. But when as the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſaith that Chriſt did eate, curious men moue a queſtion, what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came of that meate? But the anſwere is eaſie: that like as it was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of nothing, ſo was it eaſily brought to nothing by the diuine power of Chriſt. That meate which is taken for the ſuſtenance of the bodie, is concoct and afterward digeſted: but wee knowe that Chriſt tooke this meate to feede our faith, and in this vſe was it ſpent. And thoſe men are deceiued who thinke that Chriſt did onely ſeeme to eate. For what good coulde ſuch a viſure or vaine ſhewe haue done. For when as wee ſay that Chriſt was not enforced with any neceſſitie of his owne to eate, but that hee meant onelie to prouide for thoſe that were his, all occaſion is cutte off from the friuolous inuentions of men.</p>
               <p n="42">42 <hi>And he commaunded vs.</hi> Hee beginneth in this place to intreat of the kingdome of Chriſt, when he ſaith, that Chriſt did riſe againe for this cauſe that hee may once iudge the worlde. For by the ſame right are the gouernement of heauen and earth, and the perpetuall gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church due to him: he ſaith that he ſhall be iudge <hi>of quicke and deade,</hi> becauſe when as the deade ſhall riſe againe, others alſo who ſhall then remaine aliue,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15.51 52. 1.

And chiefely euery one of vs doeth feele in himſelfe too much, what a hard matter it is, both to lift vp our mindes to hope for the comming of Chriſt, which are intangled in earthly ſnares, and alſo continually to keep them fixed in this meditation, ſeing they ceaſe not with their light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to be carried hither and thither continually.</p>
               <p n="43">43 <hi>To him beare all the Prophets.</hi> Luke toucheth and gathereth the ſumme of the ſermon briefly as we haue ſaid: therefore is he ſo ſhort in noting the fruit of the hiſtorie. Let vs knowe that the wordes vttered by Peter are not recited in this place: but that it is onely declared of what things he intreated. And wee muſt conſider three things, That it is the proper office of Chriſt, to reconcile men to God, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their ſins are done away: that we haue remiſſion of ſinnes by faith: that this doctrine is not newe or of late inuented, but that it had all the Prophets of God ſince
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:7788:139"/> the beginning of the world to beare witneſſe of it. As touching the firſt, if God be pleaſed and pacified, by not imputing our ſinnes, it appeareth hereby, that he hateth and is diſpleaſed with all mankinde, vntill ſuch time as they begin to pleaſe him by free pardon. Therefore wee are all condemned of ſinne, which maketh vs ſubiect to the wrath of God, and bindeth vs with the guiltineſſe of eternall death, and becauſe we are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of righteouſneſſe in our ſelues, we are taught to flie vnto the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of God, as vnto our onely fortreſſe. When as he ſaith that the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full receiue remiſſion of ſinnes, there is vnderſtoode a hidden contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie betweene them and God. For God muſt needs offer it of his own accord that the faithful may receiue it. When as he ſaith that it is giuen by the name of Chriſt, his meaning is, that we retune into Gods fauour by the benefite of Chriſt alone, becauſe he hath once reconciled him to vs by his death: or as they ſay commonly, that we obtaine forgiueneſſe of ſinnes by Chriſt his mediation and comming betweene, and by none other meanes. Satan could neuer blot out of the minds of men the fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of their giltineſſe, but that they were alwayes carefull to craue par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don at Gods hands: but foraſmuch as there was but one way and means to obtaine pardon: miſerable men, being deluded with the iuglings of Satan, did inuent to themſelues wonderful Labarinths, in whoſe crooks and turnes they wearied themſelues in vaine. This firſt errour did firſt leade them away from the right way, becauſe they aſſayed to deſerue pardon, which is offered freely, and is receiued by faith alone. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwarde there were innumerable kindes of ſatisfactions inuented whereby they appeaſed God. The beginning thereof flowed in deede from the word of God, but foraſmuch as when God gaue vnto the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers the ſacrifices and rites of oblations, hee ſhadowed Chriſt, blind and prophane men, ſetting Chriſt aſide, and following a vaine ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe, did corrupt all that which was Gods in ſacrifices and ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Wherefore what ſacrifices ſoeuer the Gentiles did vſe ſince the beginning of the worlde, and thoſe which the Turkes and Iewes vſe at this day, may bee ſet againſt Chriſt as thinges altogither contrarie. The Papiſtes are neuer a whit better, ſaue onely that they ſprinkle their ſatisfactions with the bloode of Chriſt: but they deale too diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deredly therein, becauſe being not content with Chriſt alone, they gather to themſelues on euerie ſide a thouſande manner of ſacrifices or ſatisfactions. Therfore whoſoeuer deſireth to haue remiſſion of ſins, let him not turne aſide from Chriſt euen the leaſt nayles breadth. When as we heare that we haue remiſſion of ſinnes by beleeuing, wee muſt vnderſtande and knowe the force and nature of faith, as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedlie Peter intreated aboundantly of this, after what ſort we muſt beleeue in Chriſt: and this is nothing elſe, but with the ſyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere affection of the minde to embrace him, as hee is ſet before vs in the Goſpell, ſo that faith dependeth vppon the promiſes. Yet Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſeemeth to deale amiſſe, becauſe whereas wee haue two prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal thinges by our Sauiour Chriſt, hee doeth onely make mention of the one of them, for he ſpeaketh nothing of repentance and newneſſe
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:7788:139" rendition="simple:additions"/> of life, which ought not to be omitted in the ſumme of the Goſpel. But we may eaſily anſwere, That, the regeneration of the Spirit is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended vnder faith, as it is an effect thereof. For wee beleeue in Chriſt for this cauſe, partly, that he may reſtore vs into the fathers fauor by the free imputation of righteouſnes: partly that hee may ſanctifie vs by his Spirit. And we know that we are adopted by God to be his children, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this condition, that hee may gouerne vs by his Spirite. Therefore it was ſufficient for Peter to ſhewe, howe men who were by nature eſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from God, doe returne into fauour with him. As touching the third member we neede not reckon vp al places of the Prophets, where they ſet before vs Chriſt to be the mediatour, who by obtaining pardon for our ſinnes, doth reconcile God to vs: but this is their common order of teaching, and as it were their rule, to call backe all the godly vnto that couenant, which God made with Abraham, putting the mediatour betweene. Furthermore this point is very needfull to bee knowne, that the grace which was offered at length by Chriſt, is the ſame which the lawe and the Prophetes in times paſt, deliuered vnto the fathers to be hoped for. And ſurely it was of great force with Cornelius and ſuch like, who did greatly reuerence the Law and Prophets, that they might know that that was performed &amp; accompliſhed in very deede in Chriſt, which was teſtified in the oracles of the Prophets. Therefore to the end the miniſters, of the church may agree with the Prophets in their forme of teaching, let them ſtudy by preaching to ſet foorth Chriſt: let them continually teſtifie that we muſt ſeeke righteouſnes at his hands alone, which conſiſteth vppon free remiſſion of ſinnes. This is another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of antiquitie, than that which is ſhewed with great boaſting of the Papiſts, whiles that they thruſt in the rotten inuentions of their ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, into the place of Chriſts blood.</p>

               </q>
               <p n="44">44 <hi>And as Peter yet ſpake.</hi> God declareth now by a new miracle, that the doctrine of the Goſpel is common as wel to the Gentiles as to the Iewes. And this is an excellent ſeale of the calling of the Gentiles: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Lord would neuer haue vouchſafed to beſtow vpon the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles the graces of his ſpirit, vnleſſe it had bin to declare that euen they were adopted togither into the ſocietie of the couenant. Theſe giftes
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:7788:140" rendition="simple:additions"/> mentioned by Luke, differ in deede from the grace of regeneration: &amp; yet vndoubtedly God did by this meanes ſeale both Peter his doctrine, and alſo their faith and godlineſſe which heard him. He ſaith that they were <hi>all</hi> endowed with the Spirite, like as we ſaw before, that they came all encouraged to learne &amp; obey. This viſible ſigne repreſenteth vnto vs as it were in a table, what an effectual inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of gods power the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Goſpel is. For he powred out his Spirite as Peter ſpake to the end he might ſhew, that he ſendeth not teachers to that ende, that they may beat the aire with the vaine ſound of their voice, but that he may worke mightily by their voice, and may quicken the ſame by the power of his Spirit, to the ſaluation of the godly. Thus doth Paule put the Galathians in minde, that they receiued the holy Ghoſt by the hearing of faith, and in another place he ſaith that he is the miniſter of the Spirite and not of the letter. The gift of the tongues and other ſuch like things are ceaſed long agoe in the Church, but the Spirite of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and of regeneration is of force and ſhall alwayes bee of force, which the Lorde coupleth with the externall preaching of the Goſpel, that hee may keepe vs in reuerence of his word, and may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent the deadely dotings, wherein braineſicke fellowes inwrappe themſelues, whiles that forſaking the worde, they inuent an erronious and wandering Spirit. But it doth not nor ſhall not alwayes ſo fall out, that all thoſe which heare the word with their outward eares, doe or ſhall alſo receiue the Spirite: and the miniſters do ſeldome light vpon ſuch hearers as Peter had: who are willing with one conſent to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low God. Yet hee bringeth to paſſe that all the electe feele in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelueues the conſent of the externall worde and of the ſecret power of the Spirit.</p>
               <p n="45">45 <hi>The faithfull were astonied.</hi> He calleth them faithfull who were as yet poſſeſſed with a wicked errour. So the Lorde doeth not by and by wipe away al clouds of ignorance from his, and yet they doe not darken the praiſe of faith before God, becauſe he pardoneth errours and doeth vouchſafe to fauour it as if it were pure and plaine. And yet it is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that ſeing they knew that Peter was ſent of God, they would now bee amaſed as at ſome ſtraunge and newe thing, becauſe God giueth the grace of his Spirite to thoſe, to whom hee would haue Chriſt nowe preached, but the ſodaine change is the cauſe of this, becauſe whereas God vntill that day, had ſeperated the Gentiles from his people as ſtraungers &amp; aliants, he doth now fauor them both alike, &amp; lifteth them vp into the like degree of honour. Although wee bee alſo taught by this example, howe harde a matter it is for vs to winde out our ſelues out of our errours once conceiued, eſpecially when they are of any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance.</p>
               <p n="46">46 <hi>For they heard them.</hi> Hee expreſſeth what gifts of the Spirite were powred out vpon them, and therewithall he noteth the vſe: to wit, that they had varietie of tongues giuen them, ſo that they did glorifie God with many tongues. Alſo it may be gathered out of this place, that the tongues were giuen them not onely for neceſſitie, ſeing the Goſpel was
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:7788:140" rendition="simple:additions"/> to be preached to ſtraungers and to men of another language, but alſo to be an ornament and worſhip to the Goſpel. But ambition did after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde corrupt this ſeconde vſe, foraſmuch as manie did tranſlate that vnto pompe and vaine glorie, which they had receiued to ſet forth the dignitie of the heauenly wiſedome: as Paule doth ſharply reproue this fault in the Corinthians. Therefore no maruell if God tooke away that ſhortly after, which he had giuen, and did not ſuffer the ſame to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt with longer abuſe.</p>
               <p n="47">47 <hi>Peter anſwered.</hi> Peter reaſoneth from the thing to the ſigne, for ſeing that Baptiſm is an addition or appurtenance of the ſpiritual grace: he which hath receiued the Spirite, is alſo apt to receiue Baptiſme: and this is the moſt lawfull order, that the miniſter admit thoſe vnto the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing of the vtward ſigne, whom God hath teſtified to be his children by the marke &amp; pledge of his Spirit. So that faith and doctrine are firſt. And whereas vnlearned men inferre thereuppon that infantes are not to bee baptiſed, it is without all reaſon. I graunt that thoſe who are ſtraungers from the Church muſt be taught, before the ſigne of adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be giuen them: but I ſay that the children of the faithfull, which are borne in the Church, are from their mothers wombe of the houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold of the kingdome of God. Yea the argument which they vſe prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterouſly againſt vs, do I turne backe vpon themſelues. For ſeeing that God hath adopted the children of the faithful before they be borne, I conclude thereupon that they are not to be defrauded of the outward ſign. Otherwiſe men ſhal preſume to take that from them which GOD hath granted them. As touching the manifeſt grace of the ſpirit, there is no abſurditie therein, if it folow after baptiſme in them. And as this te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie maketh nothing for maintena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of their error, ſo it doth ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie refute the errour of the Papiſts, who tie the grace of the ſpirit to the ſignes, and think that the ſame is fet from heauen with inchantments, as thoſe witches did think that they did pul down the moon with their charmes. But for as much as Luke ſaith that theſe had the holie Ghoſt giuen them who were not as yet baptiſed, he ſheweth that the ſpirit is not included in Baptiſme, Laſtlie we muſt note that the Apoſtles were content with water alone, when as they did baptiſe, and would to God this plaineſſe had bin reteined amongeſt their poſteritie, and that they had not gathered heere and there diuers trifles, whereof baptiſme is ful in poperie. They thinke that the woorthineſſe of baptiſme is adorned with oile, ſalt, ſpittle, waxe candles, whereas they are rather filthie pollutions, which corrupt the pure and natural inſtitution of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="48">48 <hi>And he commanded them to be baptized.</hi> It was not of neceſſitie that baptiſme ſhould be miniſtred by Peters hand, as Paul doth likewiſe teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie that he baptiſed few at Corinthus, for other miniſters might take this charge vpon them. Whereas he ſaith in <hi>the name of the Lord,</hi> it muſt not bee reſtrained vnto the fourme, as wee haue ſaid in the third chapter: but becauſe Chriſt is the proper ſcope of baptiſme, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are wee ſaid to bee baptiſed in his name, when as Luke ſaith laſt
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:7788:141"/> of al that Peter was requeſted by Cornelius and his kinſmen, that he would tarie a few daies, he commendeth in them their deſire to profit. They were indeed indued with the holy ghoſt, but they were not ſo com to the top, but that confirmation was as yet profitable for them. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their example, ſo often as opportunitie to profit offereth it ſelfe, we muſt vſe it diligentlie: and let vs not ſwel with pride, which ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth the way before doctrine.</p>

               </q>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>And the Apoſtles.</hi> Whereas Luke declareth that the fame of one houſe which was conuerted, was ſpread abroade euery where amongeſt the brethren, that did ariſe by reaſon of admiration: for the Iewes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted it as a monſter, that the Gentiles ſhould be gathered vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as if they ſhould haue heard that there had been men made of ſtones: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain the immoderate loue of their nation did hinder them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging the worke of god. For wee ſee that through this ambition and pride, the Church was troubled: becauſe the equalitie which did dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh their dignitie was not tollerable. For which cauſe they did contend ſtoutly, to bring the necks of the Gentiles vnder the yoke. But for as much as it was foretolde by ſo many propheſies of the prophets, that the church ſhould be gathered of all people after the comming of the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias, and foraſmuch as Chriſt had giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> commandement to his Apoſtles, touching the preaching of the goſpel throughout the whole world, how can it be that the conuerſion of a fewe men ſhoulde moue ſome, as ſome ſtrange thing, and ſhould terrifie other ſome, as if it were ſome monſter? I anſwere, that whatſoeuer was foretold touching the calling of the Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, it was ſo taken, as if the gentiles ſhoulde bee made ſubiect to the law of Moſes, that they might haue a place in the church. But the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the calling, the beginning whereof they ſaw then, was not onely vnknowen, but it ſeemed to bee quite contrary to reaſon. For they did dreame that it was vnpoſſible that the Gentiles could bee mixed with the ſonnes of Abraham, and be made one bodie with them, (the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies being taken away) but that there ſhould bee great iniurie done to the couenant of God, for to what end ſerued the law ſaue only to bee the myd wal to note out the diſagreement? Secondly becauſe they were acquainted with that difference during their whole life, the vnloked for newneſſe of the thing doth ſo pearce them, that they did forget all that which ought to haue quieted their minds: finally they do not ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way comprehend the myſterie, which as Paul teacheth, was vnknowen to the Angels from the creation of the world.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>They reaſoned with him.</hi> Obſtinacie doeth for the moſt part ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie error. This was now a fault hauing in it too groſſe ignorance, in that they did not quietly receiue the Gentiles into their boſom, vnited to them by the ſame Spirite of faith. But they doe not only leape backe, but alſo contend with Peter contentiouſly, and blame him for his fact, which deſerued great praiſe. They heare that the gentiles haue embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the word of God, what letteth them then, from imbracing them, that they may be coupled together vnder the gouernment of one God? For what more holy bond can there be, then when al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent are coupled &amp; ioyned to God? And why ſhould not thoſe grow to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether into one body, who make the Meſſias of God their head? But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſaw the externall forme of the law broken, they thought that
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:7788:142"/> heauen and earth did goe together. And note, that although Luke ſaide before that the apoſtles and brethren had heard this fame, yet he ſpake nothing of offence, but he bringeth in now as it were a new ſect of men, which did contend with Peter. The brethren ſaith he, heard, and there an ende: it followeth, <hi>When Peter</hi> was come to Ieruſalem thoſe which were of the circumciſion did contend with him: who were vndoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie vnlike to the firſt: againe theſe wordes <hi>peri tomes,</hi> doe not ſimplie ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the Iewes, but thoſe who were too much addicted to keepe the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies of the lawe. For there were none of Ieruſalem in Chriſts flock at that time, ſaue only thoſe which were circumciſed: from whom then could he diſtinguiſh thoſe men? Laſtly, it ſeemeth to be a thing vnlike to be true that the Apoſtles, and thoſe which were moderate beeing of the number of the faithfull, did attempt this cumbate. For though they had been offended, yet they might haue conferred with Peter priuately, &amp; haue demanded ſome reaſon of his fact. By theſe reaſons am I moued to think that thoſe are ſaid to be of the circumciſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who did make ſo great account of circumciſion, that they graunted no man a place in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of god, vnleſſe he took vpon him the profeſſion of the law, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing admitted into the church by this holy rite, did put off vncleanneſſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>Vnto men being vncircumciſed.</hi> This was not forbidden by the lawe of God, but it was a tradition which came from the fathers. And yet not withſtanding Peter doth not obiect that they dealt too hardly with him in this point, and that he was not bound by the neceſſitie of mans lawe, he omitteth all this defence: and doth only anſwere, that they came firſt vnto him, &amp; that they were offered vnto him as it were by the hande of God. And here we ſee the rare modeſtie of Peter, becauſe whereas tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting to the goodneſſe of the cauſe, he might haue iuſtly deſpiced vnskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full men, who did trouble him vniuſtly: yet doth he mildely excuſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe as it becommeth brethren. This was no ſmall triall, in that hee was vnworthilie accuſed, becauſe he had obeied God faithfully: but becauſe he knew that this lawe was inioyned the whole church, that euery man be ready to giue an account of his doctrine and life, ſo often as the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter requireth: &amp; he remembred that he was one of the flocke, hee doth not only ſuffer himſelfe to bee ruled, but ſubmitteth himſelfe willinglie to the iudgement of the church. Doctrine in deede, if it be of God, is pla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ced aboue the chaunce &amp; die of mans iudgement, but becauſe the Lord will haue propheſie iudged, his ſeruants muſt not refuſe this condition, that they proue themſelues to be ſuch as they will be accounted. But we ſhal ſee anone how farre the defence both of doctrine, as alſo of facts ought to extend. For this preſent we muſt know this, that Peter doeth willingly anſwere for himſelfe, when his fact is reproued. And if the pope of Rome be Peter his ſucceſſour, why is not he bound by the ſame lawe? Admit we graunt that this ſubmiſſion was voluntarie: yet why doth not the ſucceſſour imitate ſuche an example of modeſtie ſhewed vnto him? Although we need no long circumſtance here: for if that be true whiche the Popes ſpue out in their ſacrilegious decrees, Peter did treacherouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie betray and forſake the priuiledges of their ſeat: and ſo hee betraied
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:7788:142" rendition="simple:additions"/> the ſea of Rome. For after that they haue made the Pope the iudge of all the whole world, affirming that he is not ſubiect to mans iudgement: after that they haue lifted him vp aboue the cloudes, that being free fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> giuing an account, his will and pleaſure may ſtande for a reaſon: they make him foorthwith patrone of the Apoſtolike ſeate, ſtoutlie to defend the priuiledges thereof. Of what great ſluggiſhneſſe ſhall Peter then be condemned, if hee did looſe his right giuen him of God by yeelding ſo cowardly? Why did not he at leaſt obiect, that, that he was free from the lawes, and exempt from the common ſort? But he vſeth no ſuch preface, but entreth the cauſe without making any delay. And let vs remember, that there is nothing which hindereth vs from contemning that idoll ſafely, ſeeing that vſurping ſuch vnbrideled tyrannie, he hath blotted himſelfe out of the number of the Biſhops.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And Peter beginning.</hi> Becauſe this narration is all one with that which we had in the chapter next going before, and becauſe it is repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted almoſt in the very ſame wordes: if any thing need to be expounded let the Readers repayre thither. The purpoſe of Peter and all the whole ſumme of his ſpeech, ſhall appeare by the concluſion. Yet before I come thither, we muſt briefly mark that he maketh the preaching of the Goſpell the cauſe of ſaluation. <hi>Thou ſhalt heare</hi> (ſaith he) wordes wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thou maieſt haue ſaluation, not becauſe ſaluation is included in mans voice: but becauſe God offering his ſonne there, vnto eternal life, doth alſo cauſe vs to inioy him by faith. This is aſſuredly wonderfull good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God, who maketh men miniſters of life, who haue nothing, but matter of death in themſelues, and which are not only ſubiect to death in themſelues, but are alſo deadly to others. Neuertheleſſe the filthie vnthankefulneſſe of the worlde bewrayeth it ſelfe in this point, which loething true and certaine ſaluation offered vnto it, and forſaking it when it lyeth at the feete, doth imagine diuers and vaine ſaluations, in ſeeking which, it had rather gape beeing hungrie, then to bee filled with the grace of God which meeteth it, and is preſent.</p>
               <p n="16">16 <hi>I remembred the worde of the Lorde.</hi> Wee haue ſufficiently decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the firſt chapter, that when Chriſt vttered that ſentence, hee did not make a compariſon between two baptiſmes,<note place="margin">Acts. 1.5.</note> but that he intended to declare what difference there was betweene him and Iohn. For as wee diſtinguiſh the ſigne from his truth, ſo it is good to diſtinguiſh the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter from the authour: leaſt mortall man challenge that which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to God. Man hath the ſigne in his hand, it is Chriſt alone which wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth and regenerateth. For it skilleth much whether mens mindes be directed in ſeeking the graces of God: becauſe they ſhal not receiue one drop without Chriſt. Therfore there is this generall difference between Chriſt &amp; all the miniſters of the church, becauſe they giue the externall ſigne of water: but he fulfilleth and perfourmeth the effect of the ſigne by the power of his Spirite. The Readers were to be admoniſhed of this thing againe in this place: becauſe many doe falſly inferre that Iohns baptiſme &amp; ours are not all one: whiles that Chriſt challenging to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe the ſpirite, doeth leaue nothing for Iohn ſaue water alone.</p>
               <pb n="268" facs="tcp:7788:143"/>
               <p>But if any man truſting to this teſtimonie, do make Baptiſme a colde ſpectacle and voide of all grace of the Spirite, hee ſhall bee alſo great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie deceiued. For the holy Scripture vſeth to ſpeake two manner of wayes of the Sacramentes. For becauſe Chriſte is not vnfaithfull in his promiſes, he doth not ſuffer that to be vain which he doth inſtitute. But when as the ſcripture doth attribute to baptiſme ſtrength to waſh &amp; regenerate, it aſcribeth al this to Chriſt, and doth onlie teach what he woorketh by his ſpirit by the hand of man and the viſible ſigne. Where Chriſt is thus ioined with the miniſter and the efficacy of the ſpirit with the ſign,<note place="margin">Tit. 3 5.</note> there is ſo much attributed to the ſacraments as is needful. But that coniunction muſt not be ſo confuſed, but that mens mindes being drawn from mortal and frail things, and things like to themſelues, and from the elements of the world, they muſt learn to ſeek for ſaluation at Chriſtes hande, &amp; to look vnto the power of his ſpirit alone: becauſe he miſſeth the mark of faith, whoſoeuer turneth aſide euen but a little from the ſpirit vnto the ſignes: &amp; he is a ſacrilegious perſon, who taketh euen but an inch of Chriſtes praiſe, that he may deck, man therewith. And we muſt alſo remember, that Chriſt did comprehend vnder the word <hi>ſpirit,</hi> not only the gift of tongues and ſuch like things, but all the whole grace of our renuing. But becauſe theſe gifts were an excellent argument of Chriſt his power, this ſentence may wel bee applyed vnto them: I will make this more plaine: ſeeing that Chriſt did beſtow vpon the Apoſtles the viſible graces of the Spirite, hee did plainly declare that the Spirite was in his hand. So that by this meanes he did teſtifie, that he is the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone authour of cleanneſſe, righteouſneſſe, &amp; of the whole regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And Peter applyeth it vnto his purpoſe thus, that for as muche as Chriſte did goe before, carrying with him the force of Baptiſme, it became him to followe with the addition, that is, the outwarde ſigne of water,</p>
               <p n="17">17 <hi>Who was I.</hi> Now doe we ſee to what end Peter made that nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: to wit, tha he might declare, that God was the authour and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour of all the whole matter. Therefore the ſtate of the queſtion con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſiſteth in the authoritie of God: whether meat bee not of more weight then mens counſels. Peter affirmeth that hee did nothing but that which was rightly and orderly done, becauſe he obeied god: hee ſheweth that he preached the doctrin of the goſpel, neither amiſſe, neither raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, where Chriſt beſtowed the graces of his Spirit. The approbatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our doctrine, and alſo our deedes muſt be brought to this rule ſo often as me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> call vs to an account. For whoſoeuer ſtayeth himſelfe vpon the comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of god, he hath defence enough: if men be not content, there is no cauſe why he ſhould paſſe for their iudgements any more. And Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by wee gather that the faithfull miniſters of gods worde, may in ſuch ſort giue an account of their doctrine, that they may no whit impayr the credite and certaintie thereof: to wit, if they ſhew that it was giuen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by God, but if they ſhall deale with vniuſt men, who will not be enforced with the reuerence of God to yeeld, let vs let them alone with their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacie, appealing vnto the day of the Lorde. And we muſt alſo note,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:7788:143" rendition="simple:additions"/> that we doe not only reſiſt God by ſtriuing againſt him, but alſo by lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering, if we doe not that which our calling requireth and which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to it. For Peter ſaith, that he cannot denie baptiſme and brotherly fellowſhip to the Gentiles, but that he ſhould be an enemie to God. But he ſhould haue aſſayed nothing which was manifeſtly contrarie to the grace of God. That is true in deed, but he which doth not receiue thoſe whom god offereth, and ſhutteth the gate which god openeth, he hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the work of God ſo much as in him lieth: as we ſay at this day, that thoſe men make warre againſt god, who are ſet againſt the baptiſing of infants: becauſe they moſt cruelly exclude thoſe out of the church who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> god hath adopted into the church: and they depriue thoſe of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſigne whom God vouchſafeth to call his children. Like vnto this is that kind of reſiſting, in that many diſſemblers, who, whiles they bee magiſtrates ought to aſſiſt according to their office, the martyres of Chriſt, goe about to ſtop their mouthes and to take from them their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie. For becauſe they hate the truth, they woulde haue it ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
               <p n="18">18 <hi>When they heard theſe things they were quieted.</hi> The end doth ſhew that thoſe were not moued with malice, which did contend with Peter. For this is an euident ſigne of godlineſſe, in that beeing throughly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed touching the will of God, they ceaſe foorthwith to contend. By which example we are taught that thoſe are not to be deſpiſed, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing offended through vnaduiſed zeale, reproue any thing wrongfully: but that their conſciences muſt be appeaſed by the worde of god, which are troubled by errour, and that their docilitie is tryed at leaſt thus far foorth. As touching vs, we doe hereby in like ſort learne, whereuppon our iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t muſt depend: namely, vpon the ſole &amp; ſimple beck of god. For this honor is due to him, that his will be to vs the certaine and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall rule of truth and iuſtice. So often as it is requiſite for vs to know the cauſe of any thing, the Lorde doth not conceale the ſame from vs: but to the end he may accuſtome our faith vnto iuſt obedience, hee tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vs ſometimes ſimply and plainely that this or that thing pleaſeth him. Hee which graunteth libertie to himſelfe to inquire farther, and ta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>keth a delight in his curioſitie, doth nothing els but throw himſelf head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with diueliſh boldneſſe. And Luke doth not only declare that theſe men held their peace, but that they gaue glory alſo to God.

                  <hi>Then hath God.</hi> Luke doth briefly declare in theſe wordes, what the goſpell containeth, and to what end it tendeth: to wit, that God may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile men to himſelfe, being renued by his Spirite. The worde <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce,</hi> alone is expreſſed in this place: but when he addeth <hi>vnto life,</hi> it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth plainly that it is not ſeparated from faith. Therefore whoſoeuer will rightly profit, in the goſpel, let him put off the old man and thinke
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:7788:144"/> vpon newneſſe of life: that done let him know for a certaintie that he is not called in vain vnto repentance,<note place="margin">Ephe. 4.22.</note> but that there is ſaluation prepared for him in Chriſt. So ſhall it come to paſſe that the hope &amp; aſſurance of ſaluation ſhall reſt vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the free mercie of god alone, &amp; that the forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of ſins ſhall notwithſtanding be no cauſe of ſluggiſh ſecuritie.

In like ſort it came to paſſe that the name of Chriſt paſſing ouer mountains &amp; ſeas, did flow e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto the fartheſt parts of the world.

               <p n="20">20 Luke doth at length declare that certain of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> brought this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure euen vnto the Gentiles. And Luke calleth theſe Grecians not <hi>elle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> but <hi>elleniſtai.</hi> Therfore ſome ſay that thoſe came of the Iewes; yet did they inhabit Grecia, which I do not allow. For ſeing the Iewes whom he me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tioned a little before, wer partly of Cyprus, they muſt needs be recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in that nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber: becauſe the Iewes count Cyprus a part of Grecia.

This contrarietie doth cauſe me to expound it of the Gentiles. For Luke his meaning is, that a few did more freely preach the Goſpell, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the calling of the Gentiles was not vnknowen to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie of them all deſerueth no ſmall prayſe, becauſe being deliuered as it were out of the midſt of death, they are not afraid to do their dutie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward God euen with danger: whence we gather to what end, &amp; how far foorth chriſtians may flie perſecution: to wit, that they may ſpende the reſidue of their life in ſpreading abroad the glory of God. If any man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund how it came to paſſe, that ſtrangers lately comming and ſuch as might haue bin ſuſpected among all the Iewes, &amp; hated of them, becauſe they were baniſhed out of Ieruſalem, were ſo bold: I anſweare that this came to paſſe through the ſingular motion of God, &amp; that they conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted together ſodainly, according to the occaſion offered them. For this deliberation is not of fleſh and blood.</p>
               <p n="21">21 <hi>The hand of the Lord was.</hi> Luke proueth by the ſucceſſe, that the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel was offered vnto the Gentiles alſo by the brethren of Cyprus &amp; Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renea not raſhly nor vnaduiſedly: becauſe their labour was frutefull and profitable.

The <hi>hand</hi> as it is wel knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, doth ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie power &amp; ſtrength.

And this bleſſing of God, ſerued not a little to confirme the minds of all men. This place did alſo teach vs, that what paines ſoeuer the miniſters

Therefore let the miniſter attempt nothing truſting to his owne wit and induſtrie, but let him commit his labour to the Lord, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whoſe grace the whole ſucceſſe dependeth: and where doctrine ſhall worke effectually, let thoſe which ſhal beleeue thank god for their faith. Furthermore, we muſt note that which Luke ſaith, that many were tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto god by faith: becauſe he doth very well expreſſe the force and nature of faith, that it is not idle and cold, but ſuch as reſtoreth me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (who were before turned away from god) vnto his gouernment, and bindeth them vnto his righteouſneſſe.</p>

Therefore they contend no longer, neither doe they count it a point of raſhneſſe, that ſom durſt preach Chriſt vnto the gentiles, but by ſending helpe, they teſtifie that they allowe that which they had done: Furthermore, this was the cauſe why they ſent Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas.

<pb n="273" facs="tcp:7788:145" rendition="simple:additions"/> we ſee many ſeeke for prayſe by reprouing other men, becauſe they are more deſirous of their owne glory then of the glory of Chriſt. But the faithfull ſeruants of Chriſt muſt reioice (as did Barnabas) when they ſee the goſpel encreaſe, by whomſoeuer God ſhall make his name knowen. And aſſuredly thoſe which help one another, ſo that they acknowledge that all the effect which ſpringeth thence is the worke of God, wil neuer enuie one another, neither will they ſeeke to carpe one another, but will with one mouth and minde prayſe the power of God. Againe, this is worth the noting, that Luke doth artribute the faith of the men of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch, and whatſoeuer was worthie praiſe there, to the grace of God. He might haue reckoned vp all thoſe vertues which might make for the commendation of men: but hee comprehendeth what excellencie ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer was in that church vnder this word <hi>grace.</hi> Laſtly, we muſt note Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas his exhortatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. We haue alreadie ſaid that Barnabas did ſubſcribe to the former doctrine which they had embraced: but leaſt doctrine fal away, it is moſt requiſite that it be throughly imprinted in the minds of the faithfull by continuall exhortations. For ſeeing that we haue to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ter co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually with ſo many &amp; ſuch ſtrong aduerſaries, &amp; our mindes are ſo ſlipperie, vnleſſe euerie man arme himſelfe diligently, it wil by &amp; by fall away, which thing infinite numbers doe ſhew to be true, by their falling away. Whereas he ſetteth downe this manner of perſeuerance, that they continue with purpoſe of hearte: wee are hereby taught that faith hath taken deepe roote then, when it hath a place in the hearte. Wherefore it is no maruell, if ſcarce one of tenne of thoſe who profeſſe faith doe ſtand vnto the end, ſeing that verie few know what the affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and purpoſe of heart meaneth.</p>
               <p n="24">24 <hi>For he was a good man.</hi> Barnabas is commended with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of the holy Ghoſt: yet we muſt knowe that there was reſpect had not ſo much of him as of vs. For all thoſe are condemned of vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe and malice, who enuie other mens labours, and are grieued when they ſee the ſame haue good ſucceſſe.</p>
               <p>Alſo wee muſt note the Epithites vſed in the deſcription of a good man, full of the holy Ghoſt, full of faith. For after that hee had ſaid that hee was an vpright and good man, he ſheweth from what fountaine this goodneſſe did flowe, that abandoning the affections of the fleſh, hee did with all his heart imbrace godlines, hauing the ſpirit to be his guide. But why doth he ſeparate faith from the Spirite, whoſe gift it is? I aunſwere, that it is not named ſeuerallie, as if it were a diuers thing, but it is rather ſet, foorth as a principal token, whereby it might appeare that Barnabas was full of the holy ghoſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There was a great multitude added.</hi> Though the number of the godlie was alredie great, yet Luke ſaith, that it increaſed by Barnabas his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.

Though the Apoſtles had been long time at Ieruſalem, yet god had not vouchſafed to beſtowe vpon his church which was there, this excellent title of his ſonne: whether it were becauſe at Antioch much people was growne together into one bodie, as well of Iewes, as of Gentiles: or whether it were becauſe the churche might bee better ordered in time of peace: or becauſe they were more bolde to confeſſe their faith. There were in very deed chriſtians both at Ieruſalem and alſo in Samaria before that time: and we know that Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem was the firſt fountaine from which chriſtianitie did flowe. And what is it els to be a diſciple of Chriſte, but to be a chriſtian? But when they began plainely to bee called that which they were, the vſe of the name ſerued greatly to ſet foorth the glory of Chriſte, becauſe by this meanes they referred all their religion vnto Chriſte alone. This was therefore a moſt excellent worſhip for the citie of Antioch, that Chriſt brought foorth his name thence like a ſtanderd, whereby it might bee made knowen to all the worlde that there was ſome people whoſe Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine was Chriſt, and which did glory in his name. But and if Rome had ſuch a colour of pride, who were able to ſuffer the proud boaſtings of the Pope and his adherents? They woulde then not without cauſe thunder out, that Rome is the mother and head of al churches: but it is wel, that ſeeing they challenge to themſelues whatſoeuer, when they come to the matter, they are found altogether vaine, yea Antioch it ſelfe doth plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie proue, that the eſtate of one place is not continuall, Admit we graunt the Romanes theſe plauſible titles.

               <p n="28">28 <hi>He ſignified by the Spirit.</hi> Luke doth plainely expreſſe that the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of God was the authour of this propheſie, that wee may knowe that it was not a coniecture taken by the ſtarres or ſome other naturall cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: again, that Agabus did not play the Philoſopher after the maner of men: but he vttered that which God had appointed by the ſecrete inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Spirit. Barrenneſſe may indeed be ſomtimes fortold by the diſpoſition of the ſtarres, but there is no certaintie in ſuch foretellinges, both becauſe of the oppoſite concourſes, and alſo eſpecially, becauſe god doth gouerne earthly things at his pleaſure, farre otherwiſe than can be gathered by the ſtarres, that he may lead men away from the peruerſe beholding of ſtarres. And although theſe foretellings haue their degree, yet the propheſies of the Spirit doe far exced them. But it ſeemeth that the foretelling of the famine was vnluckie, and not to be wiſhed for: for to what end was it for me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be made miſerable before their time, by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the vnhappy euent fortold? I anſwer, that there be many cauſes, for which it is expedient that men ſhould be warned before in time whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the iudgements of God hang ouer their heads, &amp; puniſhmentes due to their ſins. I omit others which are vſuall in the prophetes, bicauſe they haue a ſpace grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted wherin to repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that they may preuent gods iudgement, who haue prouoked his wrath againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues: bicauſe the faithfull are inſtruct in time, to arme themſelues with patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: becauſe the obſtinate
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:7788:147" rendition="simple:additions"/> wickedneſſe of wicked men is conuict: becauſe both good and euill learne that miſeries doe not come by chaunce, but that they are puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments wherewith God doth puniſhe the ſinnes of the world: becauſe thoſe are awaked out of their ſleepe and ſluggiſhneſſe by this meanes, who tooke great delight in their vices. The profit of this preſent prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie appeareth by the text, becauſe the men of Antioch were thereby pricked forwarde to releeue their brethren which were in miſerie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Which happened vnder Claudius.</hi> Suetonius alſo maketh mention of this famine, who ſaieth that there were cruſtes or ſhardes throwen at Claudius his head in the middeſt of the market, and that he was ſo ſore afraid of ſtoning, that he had a ſingular care afterward during his whole life, to make prouiſion for victuall. And Ioſephus in his fifteenth booke of antiquitie, ſaith: that Iudea was ſore oppreſſed with ſcarcitie, by reaſon of continuall drought.</p>
               <p n="29">29 But here ariſeth a queſtion, ſeeing that the miſerie was common to all, why ought they rather to haue ſuccoured one people, then all the reſt? I anſwere, that for as much as Iudea was impoueriſhed with great deſtructions of warres and other miſeries, the men of Antioch were not without cauſe more mooued with the miſeries of the brethren whiche were there: ſecondly, the greater the rage of the enemies was, the more wretched was the eſtate of the brethren. Finally, Paul doth ſufficiently declare in the Epiſtle to the Galathians,<note place="margin">Gal. 3.</note> that Iudea had certaine eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all neceſſities, whereof all other had regard not without cauſe. And this thankefulneſſe deſerued no ſmall commendations, in that the men of Antioch thought that they ought to helpe the needie brethren from whom they had receiued the goſpell. For there is nothing more iuſt then that thoſe ſhoulde reape earthly thinges who haue ſowen ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all things. As euery man is too much bent to prouide for himſelfe: eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie man might readilie haue excepted and obiected: Why ſhall not I rather prouide for my ſelfe? But when they call to minde howe greatly they are indebted to the brethren, omitting that carefulneſſe, they turne them ſelues to help them. In ſumme, this almes had a double end: for the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Antioch did the dutie of charitie toward their needy brethren, &amp; they did alſo teſtifie by this ſigne, what great account they made of the Goſpell, whiles that they honoured the place whence it came.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As euerie man was able.</hi> Wee ſee the men of Antioch obſerue in this place, that meane, which Paul preſcribeth to the Corinthians: whether they did this of themſelues,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 8.6.</note> or being inſtructed by him: and it is not to bee doubted, but that hee continued like to himſelfe in both places. Therefore wee muſt follow this rule, that euerie one, conſidering how much is graunted him, impart the ſame courteouſly with his brethren as one that muſt giue an account: ſo ſhall it come to paſſe that he which is but poore ſhal haue a liberal mind, &amp; that a ſmal reward ſhalbe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a fat &amp; gorgeous ſacrifice. By this word <hi>determined,</hi> Luke giueth vs to vnderſtand, that theyr oblation was voluntarie. Which thing ought ſo
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:7788:147" rendition="simple:additions"/> to be, as Paul teacheth, that we reach out our hand vnto the needie,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 9.7.</note> not as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrained, but cheerefully. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as he nameth euery one it is all one as if he ſhuld ſay, That one did not preſcribe another a law, neither did they burthe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one another with their preiudice, but that euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow his liberalitie as ſemed good to himſelf. and we muſt note the word <hi>diaconias,</hi> wherby we are taught that rich me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue greater abu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dance gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vpon that conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that they may be the miniſters of the poore in the diſpenſation co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by God. Laſtly, Luke teacheth that the bleſſing was ſent not to all the whole nation, but only to thoſe that were of the houſholde of faith: not becauſe wee ought neuer to vſe any bountifulneſſe or curteſie toward the vnbeleeuers, ſeeing loue ought to extend it ſelfe vnto all mankinde: but becauſe thoſe ought to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, whome God hath ioined and linked to vs more neere, and with a more holy band.</p>
               <p n="30">30 <hi>Sending it vnto the Elders.</hi> Wee muſt note two thinges in this place, that the men of Antioch did chooſe faithfull men, and of knowen honeſtie to carrie their bleſſing: ſecondly, that they ſent it vnto the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, that they might wiſely beſtow the ſame. For if almes be throwe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the midſt of the common people, or bee ſet in the midſt where euerie one may take what he will, euery man will by and by take it to himſelf as if it were ſome common pray: and ſo he that is moſt bolde will defraude the needie, yea through his gredineſſe hee will cut the throates of the hungrie. Therefore let vs marke theſe places, which teach that we muſt not only deale vprightly and faithfully, but that there is alſo an order &amp; wiſedome required as well in making choice, as in all our adminiſtratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Thoſe are called Elders in whoſe hands the gouernment of the church was, among whom the Apoſtles were chiefe: the men of Antioche refer the holy money (which they had appointed for the poore) to their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. If any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> obiect that this was the office of the deaco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, foraſmuch as the Apoſtles did denie that they could both ſerue tables, and attend vpon doctrine, the anſwere is eaſie, that the Deacons were appointed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer tables in ſuch ſort, that yet notwithſtanding they were vnder the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, neither did they any thing but at their appointment.</p>

We ſee that the church had ſom ſhort truce, that it might as it were by a ſhort breathing recouer ſome courage againſt the time to come, and that it might then fight afreſh. So at this day there is no cauſe why the faithful hauing borne the bruntes of one or two conflicts ſhould promiſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues reſt, or ſhould deſire ſuch a calling as old ouerworn ſouldiars vſe to haue: let this ſuffice them if the Lord graunt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſome time wherin they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer their ſtrength. This Herod was Agrippa the greater, the ſonne of Ariſtobulus, whom his father ſlue. Ioſephus doth no where call him He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod, it may be, becauſe he had a brother who was king of Chalcis, whoſe name was Herod. This man was incenſed to afflict the churche not ſo much for any loue he had to religion, as that by this meanes hee might flatter the common people, which did otherwiſe not greatly fauour him, or rather he was moued hereunto with tyrannicall crueltie, becauſe hee was afraid of innouation, which tyraunts doe alwaies feare, leaſt it trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the quiet eſtate of their dominion. Yet it is likely that he did ſhed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent blood, that according to the common craft of kinges he might gratifie a furious people; becauſe Saint Luke will ſhortly after declare, that Peter the Apoſtle was put into priſon that he might be a pleaſaunt ſpectacle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hee killed Iames.</hi> Vndoubtedly the crueltie of this mad man was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained and brideled by the ſecret power of God. For aſſuredly he wold neuer haue been content with one or two murthers, and ſo haue abſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from perſecuting the reſt, but hee woulde rather haue pyled vp martyres vpon heapes, vnleſſe God had ſet his hand againſt him, and defended his flocke. So when we ſee that the enemies of godlineſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing full of furie, doe not commit horrible ſlaughters, that they may mixe and imbrue all things with blood, let vs knowe that we neede not thank their moderation and clemencie for this, but becauſe when the Lorde doth ſpare his ſheep, he doth not ſuffer them to do ſo much hurt as they woulde. This Herod was not ſo courteous, that he would ſticke to winne peace or the peoples fauour with the puniſhent of an hundred men or moe.</p>
               <p>Wherefore we muſt thinke with our ſelues that hee was tyed by one that had the rule ouer him, that hee might not more vehementlye op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the Churche. Hee ſlue Iames, as, when any ſedition is rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, the heads and captaines goe firſt to the pot, that the common riffe raffe may by their puniſhment be terrified. Neuertheleſſe the Lord ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered him whom he had furniſhed with conſtancie to bee put to death, that by death he might get the victorie as a ſtrong and inuincible cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion. So that the attempts of Tyrants notwithſtanding, God maketh choyce of ſweete ſmelling ſacrifices to eſtabliſh the faith of his goſpell. Luke calleth this Iames which was ſlaine the brother of Iohn, that hee may diſtinguiſh him from the ſonne of Alpheus. For wheras ſome make him a thirde coſin of Chriſtes, who was only ſome one of the diſciples, I doe not like of that: becauſe I am by ſtrong reaſons perſwaded to think
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:7788:148" rendition="simple:additions"/> that there were no more. Let him that will, repayre to the ſecond to the Galathians. Therefore I thinke that the Apoſtle and the ſonne of Alphe were al one, whom the Iewes threw down headlong from the top of the temple, whoſe death was ſo highly commended for his ſingular prayſe of holineſſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>Seeing that it pleaſed the Iewes.</hi> It appeareth more plainely by this that Herod was not moued either with any zeale that he had to Moſes lawe, or with any hatred of the Goſpell, thus to perſecute the Churche, but that he might prouide for his owne priuate affayres. For hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth in his crueltie, that hee may winne the peoples fauour. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee muſte knowe that there bee diuers cauſes, for whiche the Churche is aſſaulted on euery ſide. Oftentimes peruers zeale driueth the wicked headlong, to fight for their ſuperſtitions, and that they may ſacrifice an offering to their idols by ſheeding innocent blood: but the more parte is moued with priuate commodities onely. So in times paſt, at ſuch time as Nero knewe after the burning of the citie, that hee was lothed and hated of the people, hee ſought by this ſubtill meanes to get into fauour againe, or at leaſt he went about to ſtay their ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and complaintes, by putting certaine thouſandes of the godly to death.</p>
               <p>In like ſort, that Herod may winne the peoples fauour, who did loue him but a litte, hee putteth the Chriſtians to death as a price where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with hee might redeeme their fauour: and ſuch is our eſtate at this day: for though all men runne by troupes vppon the members of Chriſte, yet fewe are pooked forwarde with ſuperſtition: but ſome ſell them ſelues to Antichriſte like profitable bond ſlaues: otherſome beare with, and commende the outragious outcries of Monkes and the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: but wee in the meane ſeaſon, beeyng abiectes muſt bee glad to beare their mockes: yet there is one comfort which doeth excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently keepe vs on foote, in that wee knowe that our blood is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious in the ſight of Almightie GOD, which the worlde doth ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullye abuſe: yea the more ſhamefullie and reprochefullie the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked doe handle vs, ſo muche the leſſe ſhall Gods goodneſſe forſake vs.</p>
               <p n="4">4 <hi>Adding</hi> foure quaternions of ſouldiars. Luke doth in this place declare by circumſtances, that Peter was as it were ſhut vp in his graue, ſo that it might ſeem that hee was quite paſt hope. For as they diuided the day and night into foure partes by three houres: ſo Herod diuided the watches, that foure ſouldiars might alwayes keepe watche, and that one quaternion might ſucceede another euery third houre. He ſheweth the cauſe why hee was not foorthwith put to death, becauſe it had been an haynous offence to put him to death in the Eaſter holidayes. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Herod doeth not delay the time as doubtfull what to doe: but doth only waite for opportunitie. Yea hee maketh choice of a time, when as his gifte may bee more plauſible, becauſe there came a great multitude together from all partes vnto the holy day.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="280" facs="tcp:7788:149" rendition="simple:additions"/>5 <hi>But prayers were made.</hi> Luke teacheth here that the faithfull did not in the meane ſeaſon foreſlowe their dutie, Peter ſtoode in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward alone, but all the reſt fought with their prayers together with him, and they ayded him ſo much as they were able. Heereby we doe alſo ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that they were not diſcouraged: for by praier they teſtifie that they perſiſt ſo much as they are able in defence of the cauſe, for which Peter is in danger of life. This place teacheth, firſt, how we ought to be affected when we ſee our brethren perſecuted by the wicked, for the teſtimonie of the goſpell. For if wee bee ſlothfull, and if we be not inwardly tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with their daungers, we doe not only defraude them of the due du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of loue, but alſo treacherouſly forſake the confeſſion of our faith: and aſſuredly, if the cauſe be common, yea if they fight for our ſaftie and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, we do not only forſake them, but euen Chriſt and our ſelues: and the preſent neceſſitie requireth, that they be farre more feruent in prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, then commonly they are, whoſoeuer will bee counted chriſtians. We ſee ſome of our brethren (being brought to extreeme pouertie) liue in exile, others we ſee impriſoned, many caſt into ſtinking dungeons, ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nie conſumed with fire, yea we ſee newe torments oftentimes inuented, whereby being long tormented, they may feele death. Vnleſſe theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocations ſharpen our deſire to pray, we be more then blockiſh. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſo ſone as any perſecution ariſeth let vs by and by get our ſelues to prayer.</p>
               <p>Alſo it is a likely thing that the church tooke greater thought for Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters life, becauſe they ſhoulde haue ſuffered great loſſe if hee had gone. Neither doth Luke ſay barely, that <hi>prayer was made:</hi> but he addeth alſo, that it was earneſt and continual. Whereby he giueth vs to vnderſtand that the faithfull prayed not coldly or ouer fields, but ſo long as Peter was in the conflict, the faithfull did what they coulde to helpe him, and that without weariſomneſſe. We muſt alwayes vnderſtande the name of God, which is here expreſſed, whenſoeuer mention is made of prayer in the ſcripture. For this is one of the chiefeſt and firſt principles of faith, that we ought to direct our prayers vnto God alone: as he challengeth to himſelfe this peculiar worſhip,<note place="margin">Pſal. 50.15.</note> Call vppon mee in the day of tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>

                  <p n="11">
                     <hi>11</hi> Then Peter returning to himſelfe, ſaide: Nowe of a truth I knowe, that the Lord hath ſent his Angel, and hath deliuered me out of the hand of Herod, and from all the waiting of the people of the Iewes.</p>

               <p n="6">6 <hi>When he was about to bring him forth.</hi> It ſeemeth at the firſt bluſh that the Church praieth to ſmall purpoſe: for the day was now appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted wherein Peter ſhould be put to death, and he is within one night of death, and yet the faithfull ceaſe not to pray, becauſe they knowe that when the Lord doeth purpoſe to deliuer his, hee taketh his time often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the laſt and fartheſt point of neceſſitie, and that he hath in his hande diuerſe wayes to deliuer. Secondly we may thinke that they did not ſo much pray for Peters life, as that the Lord would arme him with inuincible fortitude, for the glory of the Goſpel: and that God would ſet the goſpel of his ſon, open to the reproches and ſlanders of the wicked.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That night he ſlept.</hi> Al theſe circumſtances do more ſet forth the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull power of God, for who would not haue thought that Peter was alreadie ſwallowed vp of death? for though he drew breath as yet, yet had he no chinch to creepe out at, for as much as he was beſet with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny deathes. Therefore whereas he eſcapeth from amidſt deaths, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as hee goeth ſafely among the handes of his hangmen, whereas the chaines are molten and are looſed, whereas the yron gate openeth it ſelfe to him: hereby it appeareth that it was a meere diuine kinde of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerance, and it was profitable for Peter to bee thus taught by theſe ſignes, that he might with more aſſurance forthwith declare vnto men the grace of God thus knowne. Againe it appeareth by this ſtraite keeping, that Herod meant nothing leſſe than to let Peter goe away aliue.</p>
               <p n="7">7 <hi>A light ſhined.</hi> It is to be thought that Peter alone ſawe this light: and that the ſoldiars did either ſleepe ſo ſoundly, or elſe were ſo amaſed, that they neither felt nor perceiued any thing. And there might be two cauſes why god would haue the light to ſhine: either that Peter might haue the vſe thereof, and that the darkeneſſe might be no hindrance to him: or that it might be to him a ſigne and token of the heauenly glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. For we reade oftentimes, that the Angels appeared with gliſtering brightneſſe, euen when the Sun did ſhine. Aſſuredly Peter might haue gathered by the ſtrange light that God was preſent: and alſo hee ought to haue made his profite thereof. When as the Angell ſmiteth Peters ſide, it appeereth hereby what a care God hath for his, who watcheth ouer them when they ſleepe, and raiſeth them when they are drouſie. And ſurely there were nothing more miſerable than wee, if the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of our prayers alone, did keepe God in his watching ouer vs. For ſuch is the infirmitie of our fleſh that wee faint &amp; quaile, &amp; we ſtand moſt of all in neede of his helpe, when our mindes being drawne away, do not ſeeke him. Sleepe is a certaine image of death, and doth chocke

But foraſmuch as when the faithfull goe to ſleepe, they commit their ſafetie to God, it commeth to paſſe by this meanes, that euen their ſleepe doth call vpon God. Whereas he ſaieth that immediatly after the Angel had ſaid the word, the chaines were lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: we gather by this, that there is power ynough in the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God alone to remoue al maner lets, when all waies ſeeme to be ſtopt on al ſids: ſo that if he intend to appeaſe the motions and tumults of war, although the whole world were appointed in armor, their ſpears and ſwords ſhall forthwith fal out of their hands: on the other ſide, if he be determined to puniſh vs and our ſinnes with war, in a moment in the twinkling of an eye, their minds which were before giuen to peace, ſhal wax hot, and they ſhall lay hand on their ſwords. Whereas Luke ſetteth downe ſeuerally, both the words of the Angel, and alſo the courſe of the matter, it ſerueth for the more certaintie of the hiſtorie, that it may in euery reſpect appeare that Peter was deliuered by God.</p>
               <p n="9">9 <hi>He knew not that it was true.</hi> He did not think that it was a vaine or falſe viſure, as Satan doth oftentimes dilude men with iuglings: but <hi>true</hi> is taken in this place for that which is done naturally and after the manner of men. For we muſt note the contrarietie that is betweene the thing it ſelfe and the viſion. Furthermore though he thinke that it is a viſion, yet doth he willingly obey: whereby his obedience is prooued: whiles that being content with the commandement of the angel alone, he doth not inquire nor reaſon what he muſt do, but doth that which he is commanded to do.</p>
               <p n="10">10 <hi>When they were past.</hi> God was able to haue carried Peter away in the turning of an hand: but he ouercommeth diuerſe ſtraits one after another, that the glory of the miracle might be the greater.

That euery particular man hath a particular Angel, which taketh charge of him: but it is too weak. For the ſcripture doeth ſometimes teſtifie that there is one Angel gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to a great people,<note place="margin">Exod. 14.10. 2. Kings. 6.17. Dan. 10.5.12. Pſalm. 91.11.

And in Daniel there is but one Angel of the Perſians, and one of the Grecians named. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doeth the Scripture promiſe to euery man a certaine and peculiar Angel, but rather that the Lorde hath charged his Angels to keepe all the faithfull: alſo that they pitch their tents about the godly. Therefore that vaine ſurmiſe which is common touching the two Angels of euerie man, is prophane. Let this bee ſufficient for vs, that the whole hoaſt of heauen doth watch for the ſafetie of the Church: and that as neceſſity of time requireth, ſometimes one Angel, ſometimes moe doe defende vs with their aide.

               <p n="17">17 <hi>Tel Iames and the Brethren.</hi> By Brethren I vnderſtand not euery one that was of the Church, but the Apoſtles and elders. For though it were requiſite that the myracle ſhould be made knowne to all, yet will Peter worthily for honors ſake haue his fellowes in office to be certified there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.

And there be two rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for which Peter would haue this ioyfull meſſage brought vnto the brethren: to wit, that he might ridde them of that care which did vexe them: ſecondly that they might be incouraged with ſuch an example of Gods goodneſſe to be the more bold. Whereas he paſſeth into another place, I thinke it was done for this cauſe, becauſe foraſmuch as the houſe was well knowne and famous, becauſe many of the brethren reſorted thither, hee might lye hidde elſewhere with leſſe daunger. Therefore hee ſought a place which was not ſo much ſuſpected of the enimie, and that, that hee might not onely ſaue himſelfe, but alſo his hoſtis and others.</p>

Herod examineth the matter af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward as a iudge: but when as he perceiued that the ſoldiars were in no fault, he himſelf is alſo inforced to be a witneſſe of the deliuerance wrought by God. Whereas he commandeth them to be carried out of his ſight, or to be carried to priſon, we may thereby gather, that their faithfulneſſe and diligence were approued and ſeene: for if there had beene any ſuſpition of negligence, there was puniſhment prepared for them: but the cauſe why he doeth not let them go free, was partly rage mixed with tyrannous crueltie, and partly ſhamefaſtneſſe. Though ſome expound it otherwiſe, that he commanded that they ſhould be puniſhed forthwith. And whether being angrie he deliuered them to the hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, or he was content to puniſh them with perpetuall impriſonment: it is aſſuredly an excellent example of blindnes, that whereas he ought to perceiue the power of God, yea though his eyes were ſhut, yet doth he not bend, neither doth he waxe more meeke, but proceedeth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt God of obſtinate malice: thus doth Satan depriue the wicked of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, that in ſeing they ſee not: and the Lord by ſmiting them with this horrible amaſedneſſe doeth iuſtly reuenge himſelfe and his Church.</p>

This was no ſmal trial for the godly, who might haue thought thus with themſelues, that God cared not for them: and they were afraid leaſt with Herods power his tyranny &amp; crueltie ſhould encreaſe. But the Lord had another purpoſe, for he ſet the oppreſſor of his Church on high, that he might haue the greater fall. Therefore that ſhadowiſh felicitie, wherein he delighted too much, was vnto him a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine fatting againſt the day of ſlaughter.

                  <hi>Herod was diſpleaſed.</hi> Luke vſeth the compound participle <hi>Thumoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chon,</hi> which ſignifieth priuie grudging or hatred. Therefore Herod did not make open war againſt thoſe cities, but ſuch was his diſpleaſure, that he aſſaied to ſubdue them by pollicie, as it were by vnderminding them by litle and litle. It is a rare matter ſaith Demoſthenes, for free cities to agree with Monarches. Moreouer Herod was naturally cruel, bold, of vnſatiable couetouſneſſe: and it is not to be doubted but that Tyrus and Sidon were as it were certaine barres or railes to ſtay his furie, as they were welthy cities &amp; vnaccuſtomed to beare the yoke. Alſo the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of their old glory might haue incouraged them: foraſmuch as pride commeth commonly of wealth: it is no maruell if theſe two cities were proud:<note place="margin">Iſai. 23.8. Iob. 12.</note> the one whereof Iſaias calleth Queene of the ſeas, whoſe marchants he ſaid were kings: and her chapmen Dukes. Alſo he ſaieth elſewhere that Sidon was become proud by reaſon of her wealth. And although they had ſundrie times bin brought almoſt to vtter ruine; yet the commodiouſnes of their ſituation, did ſhortly reſtore them to their wonted ſtate. Hereby it came to paſſe that they could more hardly digeſt Agrippa of late a baſe fellow, a man of no eſtimation, &amp; one who had bin let out of priſon, eſpecially ſeing that he behaued himſelfe ſo cruelly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward his own ſubiects, &amp; was trobleſome and iniurious to his neighbors.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Foraſmuch as their countrie was nouriſhed.</hi> It had not bin good for him to haue aſſailed the men of Tyre and Sidon with open warre, therefore he giueth commandement that there ſhould no corne nor victuall be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried out of his realme. By this meanes did he without any army beſiege them by little and little. For the borders of both cities were ſtrait, and their ground barren, whereas there was a great people to be fed. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore after that they were tamed with hunger, they humblie craue peace, and that not free, for aſſuredly they had ſome lawes giuen them: and it is to be thought that this Blaſtus mentioned by Luke, was not with bare words perſwaded but with rewards woone to intreat the peace. I know not why Eraſmus did thinke it good to tranſlate this place otherwiſe than the words import.</p>
               <p n="21">21 <hi>Vpon an appointed day.</hi> Luke ſaith that the men of Tyrus and Sidon
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:7788:152" rendition="simple:additions"/> had peace granted them, becauſe this was the occaſion of the kings ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without doubt, that he might make them his vnderlings hereafter. The ſame hiſtory is extant in Ioſephus in his nineteenth booke of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities: ſaue only that he calleth him euery where Agrippa, whom Luke calleth Herod. It is to be thought that Agrippa was his proper name, &amp; that he was called by none other name ſo long as he was a priuate man: but after that he was aduanced to be a king, he tooke to himſelf prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dignitie according to the name of his grandfather. Ioſephus &amp; Luke agree togither wonderfully in the thing it ſelf, and in all circumſtances. Firſt they agree concerning the place. Ioſephus ſaith that his garment was imbroidered with gold, on which when the ſunne beames light, it did gliſter again: &amp; that this was the cauſe which moued the courteours to call him a God: that he was ſodainly wounded: alſo that there was ſeene an Owle, ſitting vppon a cord ouer his head, which cord did prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſticate his ruine. And he is ſo far from doubting that his ſacrilegious pride was puniſhed with this kind of puniſhment, that he ſaith that he confeſſed the ſame openly amidſt his cruel torments, Behold me whom you call a God, I am enforced to finiſh my life moſt miſerablie. There is no mention made there of the peace made with thoſe of Tyrus &amp; Sidon: but that he made and ſet forth plaies in honour of Ceſar. But it may be that the ſolemnitie of the plaies was appointed in reſpect of the peace concluded: which we know was a ſolemne thing.</p>
               <p n="23">23 <hi>Forthwith he ſmote him.</hi> As before the Angel was a miniſter of gods grace in the deliuery of Peter, ſo now he taketh vengeance vpon Herod. And God doth ſometimes vſe the miniſtery of Angels in heauen in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing: but ſomtimes he maketh the diuels as hangmen,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 16.14. Iob. 1.11. &amp; 2.7. Exo. 12.29</note> by whoſe hand he executeth his iudgements. And this doth he as wel toward his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſeruants, as toward the reprobate. Saul was troubled and vexed by ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, but the ſame did alſo befal holy Iob. In the Pſalm the puniſhments wherewith God doth chaſten the wicked, are attributed to the euil An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels: yet we ſee how the Angel which had the gouernment of the ſafetie of the Church, ſmiteth the Egyptians in the firſt begotten: although the ſcripture calleth the wicked ſpirits Gods ſpirits, becauſe they are obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to his commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t though ful ſore againſt their wil. But wher the epithite Euil, is not added as in this place, we muſt vnderſtand the angel which doth willingly obey God, and yet the ſhape of the Owle, whereof Ioſephus maketh mention, did rather ſerue to figure the diuel, than an heauenly Angel. Furthermore, I dare not affirme for a ſuretie what ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner diſeaſe that was. The word which Luke vſeth doth ſignifie, that he was eaten vp of wormes. Many coniect that it was a louſie diſeaſe. This is certaine, that euen when he was yet aliue he was corrupt with ſtinke &amp; rottennes, ſo that he was as it were a liuing carcaſe. So that he was not onely vexed with cruel torments, but alſo made a laughing ſtocke to all men, &amp; of al men reuiled. For God intended to make choiſe of a kind of puniſhment, wherwith he might oppres the cruelty of a proud man with extrem ignominy. If he had bin ouercom of ſom great &amp; valiant army, &amp; had bin brought to pouerty, the iudgment of god had not bin ſo marked:
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:7788:153" rendition="simple:additions"/> and this had bin an honeſt and princely chaſtiſement: but foraſmuch as he abhorreth lice and wormes, and this filthines commeth out of his body,<note place="margin">Exo. 8.17.24.</note> which doth kill him by eating him vp, he is handled according to his deſerts. In like ſort Pharao, foraſmuch as he did ſo oft exalt himſelf againſt God with vntamed pride, he was not orderly aſſailed by ſome prince that did border vpon him, but Locuſts and caterpillars were gods warriars to make warre againſt him, for the more proudly a man exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth himſelf: the more doth he deſerue to be caſt downe of God into the loweſt hell with ſhame and reproch. This is the reaſon why he ſet this feigned God Herod, to be eaten vp of wormes: which he was at length enforced to grant, when he ſaid, Behold me whom ye ſaluted as a God, I die myſerablie. Such a manifeſt example of horrible vengance in a kings perſon, ought to terrifie vs not a little, from preſuming to take to our ſelues more than we ought: and that we doe not ſuffer our ſelues to be made drunke with the falſe commendation and flattery of men as with deadly poiſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Becauſe he gaue not the glorie to God.</hi> He is condemned of ſacrilege not only becauſe he ſuffered himſelf to be called god, but becauſe forgetting himſelfe, he tooke to himſelfe the honor due to God. We do not reade that the king of Babilon was thus extolled: and yet the Prophet vpbrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to him that he went about to make himſelf equal with God. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this ſacrilege is a common fault in all proud men,<note place="margin">Iſai. 14 13.14.</note> becauſe by taking to themſelues more than they ought, they darken the glory of God: and ſo like gyants, ſo much as euer they are able, they indeuor to pluck God out of his ſeat. Howſoeuer they do not vſurpe the title of God, neither openly boaſt with their mouth that they are gods, yet becauſe they take to themſelues that which is proper to God, they deſire to be and to be accounted gods, hauing brought him vnder. Furthermore the Prophet pointeth out the beginning of this euill in one word, when he bringeth in Nabucadonezer ſpeaking on this wiſe,<note place="margin">Iſai. 14.</note> I will go vp. Wherefore there is but one remedie, if euery one keepe himſelfe in that degree wherein he is placed. Let thoſe who are baſe and caſtawayes not deſire to climbe higher: let kings and thoſe who are aboue others, remember that they are mortall, and let them modeſtly ſubmit their highnes to God. And we muſt note that it is not ynough if men giue to God onely halfe the honor which is due to him, who chalengeth all that wholly which is his owne: if they ſubmit themſelues but in part, whom he will haue to be throughly humbled. Now foraſmuch as the Scripture diſpoileth vs quite of all praiſe of wiſedome, vertue, and righteouſnes, there is no one of vs that can take to himſelfe the leaſt iot of glory, without ſacrilegious rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing of God. And it is a wonder, that ſeing the Scripture pronounceth that all thoſe make as it were open war againſt God, which exalt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and we do all grant, that that cannot be done without our ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw: the greateſt part of men runneth notwithſtanding headlong with furious boldneſſe vnto their owne deſtruction. For there is ſcarce one of an hundred who being mindfull of his condition, doth leaue to God his glory vndiminiſhed.</p>

               <p n="1">1 Here followeth an hiſtorie not onely worthy to be remembred, but alſo very profitable to be knowne, how Paul was appointed the tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of the Gentiles, for his calling was as it were a key, whereby God opened to vs the kingdome of heauen. We know that the couenant of eternall life was properly concluded with the Iewes,<note place="margin">Ephe. 2.12</note> ſo that we had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do with Gods inheritance, foraſmuch as we were ſtrangers: and the wall of ſeperation was put betweene, which did diſtinguiſh thoſe of the houſhold from ſtrangers. Therefore it had profited vs nothing, that Chriſt brought ſaluation vnto the world, vnleſſe the diſagreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken away, there had bin ſome entrance made for vs into the Church. The Apoſtles had alreadie receiued commandement,<note place="margin">Mar. 16.15</note> touching the preaching of the Goſpel throughout the whole world, but they had kept themſelues vntil this time within the borders of Iudea. When
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:7788:154" rendition="simple:additions"/> Peter was ſent to Cornelius, it was a thing ſo new and ſtrange, that it was almoſt counted a monſter: ſecondly that might ſeeme to be a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledge granted to a few men extraordinarily: but now foraſmuch as God doth plainely and openly appoint Paul and Barnabas to be Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles of the Gentiles, by this meanes he maketh them equall with the Iewes: that the Goſpel may begin to be common as wel to the one as to the other. And now the wal of ſeperation is taken away, that both thoſe who were farre off and thoſe which were nigh hand may be reconciled to God: and that being gathered vnder one head, they may grow togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be one bodie. Therefore Paul his calling ought to be of no leſſe weight amongſt vs,<note place="margin">Geneſ. 22.17.</note> than if God ſhould crie from heauen in the hearing of all men, That, the ſaluation promiſed in times paſt to Abraham and to the ſeede of Abraham, doth no leſſe appertaine vnto vs at this day, than if we had come out of the loynes of Abraham. For this cauſe is it that Paul laboureth ſo much in defenſe and auouching of his calling: that the Gentiles may aſſuredly perſwade themſelues, that the doctrin of the goſpel was not brought to them by chance,<note place="margin">Gala. 15. &amp; 2.8.</note> neither by mans raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but firſt by the wonderfull counſell of God, ſecondly by expreſſe commandement, whiles that he made that knowne to men which he had decreed with himſelfe.</p>

                  <hi>There were in the Church.</hi> I haue declared in the fourth to the Epheſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and in the twelfe of the former to the Corinthians, what diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence there is (at leaſt in my iudgement) betweene Doctors and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. It may be that they are in this place Synonyma, or that they ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie both one thing, ſo that this is Lukes meaning, that there were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie men in that Church endewed with ſinguler grace of the Spirite, to teach. Surely I cannot ſee how it can hange togither to vnderſtand by Prophets, thoſe which were endewed with the gift of foretelling things: but I thinke rather that it ſignifieth excellent interpreters of ſcripture. And ſuch had the office to teach &amp; exhort, as Paul doth teſtifie in the fourteenth of the former to the Corinthians.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 14.27.</note> We muſt mark Luke his drift: Paul and Barnabas were miniſters of the church of Antioch, God calleth them thence now vnto another place. Leaſt any man ſhuld think that, that Church was deſtitute of good &amp; fit miniſters, ſo that God did prouide for other Churches with the loſſe of it: Luke preuenteth this, &amp; ſaith, that there was ſuch ſtore there, that though it did helpe others, yet did there remaine ſufficient for the vſe thereof: whereby appeareth how plentifully God had powred out his grace vpon the church, whence riuers as it were might be deducted &amp; caried into diuers places. So euen in our time, God doeth ſo enrich certaine Churches more than other, that they be ſeminaries to ſpread abroad the doctrine of the Goſpel. It muſt needs be that Manaim who was brought vp with Herod, came of ſome noble family. And this doeth Luke recite of purpoſe, that he may ſet forth to vs his godlines, who deſpiſing worldly pompe, had coupled himſelf to the ſimple &amp; deſpyſed flock of Chriſt. He might in deed haue bin a principall courteour, if he had bin ruled by ambition: but that he may wholly addict himſelfe to Chriſt, he refuſeth not to change thoſe
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:7788:154" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſmokes of honor with reproch and ignominy. For if we conſider in what ſtate the church ſtoode then, he could not giue his name to the Goſpel, vnleſſe he ſhould make himſelf ſubiect to common infamy. Therfore the Lord meant to teach vs by his example to deſpiſe the world, that thoſe may learne with a valiant and lofty mind to deſpiſe the world, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not otherwiſe be true chriſtians, vnles they caſt away thoſe things which are precious to the fleſh, as hurtful lets and hindrances.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>And they ministred to the Lord.</hi> The word which Luke vſeth doth not onely ſignifie to be occupied about holy things, but alſo ſome times to beare publike offices. And becauſe the holy rites of the Gentiles did for the moſt part conſiſt vpon burnt offerings and ſacrifices: it is often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for to offer ſacrifice: which ſenſe did wel like the Papiſts, that they might proue that the Apoſtles did vſe ſome ſacrifice. But admit it were ſo: yet do they fooliſhly pretend for defenſe of their Maſſe that the Teachers of Antioch did ſacrifice. Firſt foraſmuch as the word is of the plurall number, it followeth that euery one of them did ſay Maſſe. But letting toies paſſe, I ſay we muſt conſider, what maner of ſacrifice Chriſt commended to his Church. The Papiſts feigne that the office of Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood is inioyned them, to ſacrifice Chriſt, and by ſacrificing him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme peace with God. There is ſo little mention made hereof in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that the ſonne of god doth rather chalenge this honor to himſelfe alone. Wherfore Chriſts Church hath another Prieſthood, to wit, that euery man may offer himſelfe and his to God: and that the publike mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters may ſacrifice to God, ſoules, with the ſpirituall ſword of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, as Paul teacheth Rom. 15.16. Moreouer the prayers of all the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, are the ſpiritual calues of the lippes, wherewith God is well pleaſed, when they are offered vp vpon the holy Altar; that is in Chriſts name,<note place="margin">Oſee. 14.3. Hebru. 13.15.</note> in the thirteenth to the Hebrewes. Therefore when Luke ſaith that the Prophetes and teachers miniſtred to God when the Spirite ſpake to them: I vnderſtand nothing elſe but that they were in the publike ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He addeth faſting, that we may know that their minds were then free from al impediments, that nothing might hinder them from giuing atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dance to prophecying. But the queſtion is whether they keept a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon faſt, or Luke doth only ſignifie that they were faſting the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vntil that time. This is without queſtion that theſe circumſtances were expreſſed, that Paul his calling may cary the more credit amongſt vs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seperate to me.</hi> God commandeth that Paul and Barnabas be ſent, by the conſent of the Church, thither whither he had appointed them to be ſent. Whereby we gather that there is no lawfull election of Paſtors, ſaue only wherein God is chiefe. For whereas he hath commanded that the Church ſhould elect paſtors &amp; Biſhops, he hath not therefore gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted men ſo much libertie, but that he will beare the chiefeſt ſway as the chiefe gouernour. The ordinarie election of Paſtours differeth from this appointing of Paul &amp; Barnabas, becauſe it was requiſite that they ſhuld be appointed by the heauenly Oracle, to be the Apoſtles of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles: which is not neceſſarie to be done daily in ordaining Paſtours. But they agree in this, that as God did teſtifie that Paul and Barnabas
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:7788:155" rendition="simple:additions"/> were already appointed by his decree to preach the goſpel: ſo none may be called vnto the office of teaching ſaue onely thoſe whom God hath already choſen to himſelfe after a ſort. Furthermore there is no neede that the Spirite ſhould cry to vs out of heauen, that he is called of God about whom we are, becauſe we receiue thoſe as it were from hand to hand (as they ſay) whom God hath furniſhed with neceſſarie gifts, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as they are framed and made fit by his hand. But whereas Luke ſaith in this place, that Paul was appointed by the voyces and conſents of the Church: it doth ſeeme not to agree with Pauls own words,<note place="margin">Galat. 1.1.</note> where he doth denie that he was called of men or by men. I anſwere that he was made an Apoſtle long before (and that by no voices of men) before ſuch time as he was ſent vnto the Gentiles: and he had now already ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted the office of an Apoſtle many yeeres, when he was called to go to the Gentiles by a new oracle. Wherefore that he may haue God for the author of his apoſtleſhip, it is not without cauſe that he excludeth me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And he doth not now command that he be ordained by the church, therefore, that his calling may depend vpon men: but God publiſheth that his decree which was as yet knowne to a few, and that with a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like commandement, and he commandeth that it be ſealed with the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne ſubſcription of the Church.<note place="margin">Ephe. 2.14</note> Therefore this is the meaning of the words. That this is the time, wherein Paul muſt preach the Goſpel, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Gentiles, and the wall being pulled downe, he muſt gather a Church of the Gentiles, who were before ſtrangers from the kingdome of God. For although god had vſed him hitherto at Antioch &amp; elſwhere, this was now added as a peculiar thing, that god did intend to adopt the Gentiles into the ſame inheritance of life with the Iewes. But and if he were thus created a teacher of the Church from the beginning, he ſhuld not then haue bin called at that time by men. For ſeing the Lord doth pronounce that he had called him, what doth he leaue for the Church, ſaue onely that they ſubſcribe obediently? For mens iudgement is not here put in as in a doubtful matter, neither haue their voices &amp; conſents any freedome. But we muſt marke what I haue already ſaid, that Paul &amp; Barnabas are not now onely appointed teachers, but they haue an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary office inioyned the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that they may begin to bring the grace of God commonly vnto the Gentiles. And that doe the words import when it is ſaid, <hi>Seperate to the work.</hi> For vndoubtedly he ſpeaketh of a new worke, &amp; which had heretofore not bin vſed. But how is Barnabas in this place appointed to be Pauls companion and fellow in office, who as far as we can read, did neuer execute the office of teaching? yea who did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes giue Paul leaue to teach, without ſaying any thing himſelfe? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere that he had occaſions ynough offered him to ſpeake in Paul his abſence, ſo that they had both of them ynough to do. For one could not alwayes be preſent in all places. It is not to be doubted but that he did faithfully diſcharge that duty which God had inioyned him, and that he was no dumbe looker on. And why ſhould we wonder that Luke doth not ſet downe his ſermons in plaine words, ſeing that he ſcarce repeateth one of a thouſand, of Pauls?</p>

                  <hi>The Spirit ſaid.</hi> Whatſoeuer Macedonius and his ſect obiect that they may turne their backs, yet we haue a more plaine and ſound teſtimony of the diuine eſſenſe of the ſpirit in this place, than that they can eſcape it and make it fruſtrate. There is nothing more proper to god, than with his power and commandement to gouerne the Church alone. But the Spirit chalengeth this right, when he commandeth that Paul &amp; Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas be ſeperated to him, and teſtifieth that they were called by his beck. Aſſuredly we muſt needs confeſſe that the bodie of the Church is lame and without a head, vnleſſe we confeſſe that it is God who ordereth the ſame at his pleaſure, who ſetteth teachers ouer it, who gouerneth the proceedings and order thereof. We ſhall haue afterward Chapter 20. in Pauls ſermon, that all Biſhops are placed by the holy Ghoſt, which gouerne the Church.<note place="margin">Act. 20.28.</note> But no man is to be counted a lawfull Paſtour of the Church, as the ſame Paul witneſſeth, ſaue he which is called of God: Neither doth God point out falſe Prophets by any other marke, ſaue onely by this, that he hath not ſent them. Therefore we gather that the holy Ghoſt is God in deede, whoſe authoritie is ſufficient to chooſe Paſtours, and who hath the chiefe rule in chooſing them. Which is likewiſe confirmed out of the words of Eſay:<note place="margin">Iſai. 48.</note> And nowe beholde the Lord hath ſent me, and his Spirite. Furthermore we muſt note out of theſe words, that he is a perſon truely ſubſiſting in God. For if we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Sabellius his inuention, that the worde Spirite importeth no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but that it is a bare adiunct, that ſhalbe a fooliſh and abſurd ſpeech, that the holy Ghoſt hath ſaid: Iſaias alſo ſhould fooliſhly aſcribe to him the ſending of a Prophet.</p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>When they had fasted and praied.</hi> That they may obey the Oracle, they do not onely ſend Paul and Barnabas away: but alſo with a ſolemn rite they appoint them to be the Apoſtles of the Gentiles. It is without queſtion that this was a publike faſt. Luke ſaid before that they were faſting, foraſmuch as they were buſied in their miniſterie: it might be that that was according to the cuſtome, but now there is another rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. For in appointing a publike faſt, which vſed to be done in hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and of great importance, they prouoke both themſelues and others vnto an earneſt feruentneſſe in prayer. For this is oftentimes added in Scripture as a helpe to praier. But (it was a matter of ſuch weight to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the kingdome of Chriſt amongſt the Gentiles) the teachers of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch do not without cauſe earneſtly pray the Lord, that he will inable his ſeruants. And that was not the end of their praier, that God would by his Spirit of wiſdome &amp; diſcretion, gouerne their iudgments in choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing: becauſe al diſputation or doubting concerning this matter was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away: but that God would furniſh thoſe with the Spirit of wiſdome and ſtrength, whom he had alreadie choſen to himſelfe: that he would ſtrengthen them with his power againſt all the inuaſions of Satan and the world: that he would bleſſe their labors, that they might not be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitful: that he would open a gate for the new preaching of the goſpel. The laying on of hands which Luke reckneth vp in the third place, was a kinde of conſecration, as we haue ſaid Chapter 6.<note place="margin">Acts. 6.6.</note> For the Apoſtles
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:7788:156"/> retained the ceremonie which was vſed amongſt the Iewes according to the old cuſtome of the Law: as alſo kneeling &amp; ſuch rites, which were profitable to exerciſe godlineſſe. In ſum, this is the end why they laid their hands vpon Barnabas and Paul, that the church might offer them to God, and that they might with their conſent declare that this office was inioyned them by God. For the calling was properly Gods alone: but the externall ordaining did belong to the Church, and that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the heauenly Oracle.</p>

               <p n="5">5 He ſaith that they beganne to preach the Goſpel firſt in Salamis a famous Citie of Cyprus. Notwithſtanding they ſeem to begin amiſſe: for whereas they were ſent ſpecially to the Gentiles, they preach the word of God neuertheleſſe to the Iewes, I anſwere that they were not ſo addicted to the Gentiles, that ſetting aſide the Iewes it ſtoode them vppon to goe ſtreight to the Gentiles. For when God did make them teachers of the Gentiles, he did not depoſe them from the office which they had heretofore exerciſed. So that there was no reaſon to let them, but that they might take paines both with Iewes and Gentiles: yea
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:7788:156" rendition="simple:additions"/> farther it was meete that they ſhoulde beginne with the Iewes, as we ſhall ſee in the end of the Chapter. Moreouer Luke addeth by the way, that they were holpen by Iohn: for his meaning is not that hee was their miniſter for any priuat vſe, or for the vſes of bodie: but rather in that hee was their helper to preach the Goſpel, hee commendeth his godly ſtudie and induſtrie.

And aſſuredlie where the trueth of God doeth not appeare, the more men ſeem to be wiſe, the more filthylie fooliſh are they.

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is neither iudgement not wiſedome ſaue onely from the Spirit of God. And this is the iuſt vengeance of God vpon all idolaters,

               <p n="8">8 <hi>To turne away the deputie from the faith.</hi> No maruell if the ſeducer ſeeke to put away the light, whereby he ſaw his owne darknes driuen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. The ſame ſtoure haue we at this day with a number of brablers, who vſing to ſell their ſmokes, and to ſhut by all ſhifts poſſible the eyes of the ſimple, that they may not behold the ſunne of righteouſnes being now riſen. We muſt wraſtle with ſuch lets: for as there be alwayes, and euery where magicians preſent, which procure vs ſome buſines: Satan thruſteth in lets ynough which poſſeſſe our minds to driue away Chriſt: which the fleſh is too ready to receiue. Finally both the inticements of the world and the wicked affections of our fleſh, are as many charmes, whereby Satan ceaſeth not to ouerthrow the faith.</p>
               <p n="9">9 <hi>And Saul who was alſo called Paul.</hi> Luke ſheweth now how God brake the bond wherein the deputie was bound. For ſeing that he was too much addicted to the magician, he could not embrace true doctrin as one that was free and at libertie: for the diuell keepeth thoſe minds (which he hath intangled) in his ſlauery after a wonderfull and vncre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible manner, that they cannot ſee euen the moſt plaine truth: but ſo ſoone as he was once vanquiſhed, Paul could eaſily enter in vnto the deputie. And marke what Luke ſaith, that <hi>the faith</hi> is ouerthrowne, when the word of God is reſiſted. Whence we may gather, that Faith is ſo grounded in the word, that without this ſhoare it fainteth at euerie aſſault: yea that it is nothing elſe but the ſpirituall building of the word of God.</p>
               <p n="10">10 <hi>O thou full of all deceit.</hi> It was not without cauſe that Paul was thus hot and angrie, for he had no hope to do any good if he ſhould deale af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome moderate &amp; milde ſort. We muſt alwaies begin with doctrine, and thoſe are alſo to be admoniſhed, exhorted, and pricked forward,
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:7788:157" rendition="simple:additions"/> who do not as yet appear to be altogether obſtinate. Neither doth Paul ſo vehemently inueigh againſt the ſorcerer at the firſt daſh: but when he ſeeth him maliciouſly and manifeſtly fight againſt the doctrine of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, he handleth him like a bondſlaue of Satan. Thus muſt wee deale with the deſperate enemies of the goſpel, in whom appeareth open con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumacie, and wicked contempt of God, eſpecially when they ſtoppe the way before others. And leaſt any man ſhould thinke that Paul was out of meaſure angrie, Luke ſaith plainely, that the inſpiration of the ſpirite was his guide. Wherefore this heat of zeale is not only not to be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>he<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, but it ought to make the profane contemners of God ſore afraid, who feare not to rebell againſt his worde: foraſmuch as this iudgement is giuen vpon them all not by mortall man, but by the holy Ghoſt, by the mouth of Paul. As touching the wordes, this place refuteth their error, who thinke that Paul tooke his name of the deputie, as if hee had ſet vp ſome token of victorie. There may many reaſons bee brought and thoſe ſtrong enough, on the contrarie: but this one place is ſufficient, where Luke ſheweth that at ſuche time as the deputie was not brought to the faith he had two names. And it is not to be douted, but that he retained his owne name amongſt the Iewes, and we know that this was an vſuall thing, that thoſe who were citizens of Rome ſhould borow ſome Italian name. Luke ioyneth ſubtiltie with deceit which is contrarie to ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: to wit, whiles craftie men transforme their wit hither and thither, ſo that they haue in them no ſimplicitie, though the Greeke worde which Luke vſeth, ſignifieth readie boldneſſe to doe hurt: but the former ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication agreeth better. By <hi>the ſonne</hi> of the Diuell, is meant a reprobate and deſperate man. Such are all thoſe which reſiſt maliciouſly and as it were of ſet purpoſe, that which is iuſt and right: therefore Paul addeth that he is a great <hi>enemie</hi> of all righteouſneſſe.</p>

                  <hi>Doeſt thou not ceaſe to peruert.</hi> He calleth all that meanes wherby the Lord bringeth vs vnto himſelfe, the wayes of the Lorde. Hee teſtifieth that this is plaine and ſtreight: and hee accuſeth the ſorcerer, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the ſame, crooked, full of turninges, and doubtfull, with his boughts and turnes. Whence may be gathered a profitable doctrine, that it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to paſſe through the ſubtiltie of Satan that wee doe not readilie with ſtreight courſe goe vnto the Lord. For he ſheweth vs in his worde a plaine way and ſuch as is not thornie. Wherefore wee muſt take good heed of ſeducers, which trouble the way with their ditches or thornes, or els make the ſame hard and vnpleaſaunt. And it ſhall bee conuenient to repeate here, that which I touched before, that the ſeruants of Chriſte muſt not be blamed if they doe ſore inueigh againſt the profeſſed ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of ſound doctrine: vnleſſe we will accuſe the holy Ghoſt of intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perancie. Neither am I ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t how eaſily men may fall in this point, for which cauſe godly teachers muſt take ſo much the more heed, firſt that they fauour not the affections of the fleſh too much vnder the colour of zeale: ſecondly, that they breake not out with headlong and vnſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable heat, where there is yet place for moderation: thirdly, that they giue not themſelues ouer to fooliſh and vncomely railing: but only that
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:7788:158" rendition="simple:additions"/> they expreſſe the vnſeemelineſſe of the thing by grauitie and weight of wordes. Such was the vehemencie of holy zeale and of the ſpirit in the prophets, which if daintie and ſoft men iudge troubleſome and raging, they conſider not how deare and precious Gods truth is to him. Nowe there riſeth not one Elimas to ſubuert the faith, but manie, and thoſe which are far more wicked. For we ſee with what ſacrilegious boldneſſe they deſpoyle God of al honour, with what filthie corruptions they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane all religion, how cruelly they throw miſerable ſoules headlong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to eternall deſtruction, how vnſeemelily they mocke Chriſt, how filthily they disfigure all the whole worſhip of God, with what cruell reproches they re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the holy truth of god, with what barbarous tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ny they lay waſt the church of God: ſo that you would ſay that they tread god vnder foot. And yet there be manie crabbed philoſophers, who wold haue theſe fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Giants flattered and clawed by the back.

Neither muſt we think that they wer indued with this power to puniſh any man ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as it ſeemed good in their own eies, but the ſame Spirit of god which did thus arm them, did direct them vnto the lawfull and right vſe. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt remember that which we had before, that Paul ſpake by inſpiration of the Spirit.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, it was a very fit kinde of puniſhment. For ſeeing that the ſorcerer aſſayed to darke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſunne, and to take from others the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the light, he was by good right caſt into horrible darkneſſe. But now foraſmuch as many of the Papiſts doe farre exceed this ſorcerer at this day in vngodlines, it is a wonder why they be ſuffered to be ſo bolde without being puniſhed. Is the hand of God weakened? Is he leſſe care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for his glorie? Hath he no care to reuenge the Goſpel? I anſweare, that this viſile puniſhment, which was once laid vppon the ſorcerer, and ſuche as this, are perpetuall examples of Gods wrath againſt all thoſe who are not afraid either to corrupt and depraue, or openly with ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to reſiſt the pure doctrine of the goſpell. For wee doe knowe that myracles were wrought for a time to this end, that they may continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie be in force, and bee freſh before our eyes, and that they may giue vs light to behold the iudgements of God, which we cannot ſee ſo plainlie.
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:7788:158" rendition="simple:additions"/> But it is not for vs to preſcribe God this or that way to puniſh his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Sergius Paulus, who before he came to mans eſtate had no taſte of true religion: who from his childhood was infected with diuers ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and had very hard lets, which kept him backe from imbracing the faith: laſtly, who was bewitched with the dotings of the ſorcerer, that he could ſcarce com to the faith, had need of no ſmal helps: hereby it came to paſſe, that God did as it were reach his hand out of heauen manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, though he helped vs all in his perſon. For the ſame goſpell, the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie whereof was then eſtabliſhed, is at this day preached to vs, and yet notwithſtanding God doeth not ſo linger, but that hee ſheweth his fearefull power diuers wayes againſt the enemies of the goſpell: vnleſſe our eyes were ſo dull when hee ſheweth his iudgements, that wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee.</p>
               <p n="12">12 <hi>Then when the deputie ſaw.</hi> This is that which I ſaide, that the ſnares were broken, wherein Elimas kept him intangled. For hee was brought by the myracle vnto faith: becauſe the reuerence of doctrine is the beginning of faith, and the preparation. Therfore foraſmuch as hee ſawe an euident token of the power of God, he knew that Paul was ſent of God, and ſo he began to reuerence his doctrine, wherof he did doubt before.

But before he come to that, he doth by the way ſpeake of the departure of Iohn, becauſe it was afterwarde a cauſe of dolefull diſagreement, when he ſaith, Paules companions looſed from Paphus, he doeth in the firſt place meane Paul himſelfe, ſecondly the other, one excepted.

The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Sabboth had another end alſo, that it might bee a figure of the ſpirituall reſt, when as the faithfull being dead to the worlde, and the fleſh, abandon their owne will, and ceaſe from their works. Becauſe we haue the truth hereof in Chriſt, whiles that being buried togeather with him we put off the old man, therefore the old figure is paſt. But god had reſpect alſo vnto the politike vſe, that the Iewes being free from all other cares and buſineſſes might keepe their holy aſſemblies. So that the ceaſing off from earthly workes, did giue a place to their heauenly exerciſes: So euen at this day we muſt vſe holy dayes: for we muſt ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore omit all other thinges, that we may the more freely ſerue God.</p>

And this is a notable place, out of which we learne, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter what ſort they handled doctrine at that time among the Iewes. The Law and the Prophetes had the firſt place: becauſe there muſt nothing be ſet before the church, which was not drawen out of that fountaine. Alſo we gather by this, that the ſcripture was not ſuppreſſed among a fewe, but that both one and other were admitted to the reading therof, afterwarde, thoſe who were able and had the grace to teach and exhort had the ſeconde place, as interpreters of the ſcripture which was read. Notwithſtanding Luke ſheweth laſt of all, that euery one was not ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ſpeake, leaſt confuſion ſhould ariſe by libertie: but the office of exhorting was committed to certaine men, whom hee calleth Rulers of the ſynagogue, or maſters. Therfore Paul and Barnabas begin not forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to ſpeake, leaſt they diſturbe the accuſtomed order with too much haſt: but they doe modeſtly ſtay till they haue lybertie graunted them to ſpeake, and that with their leaue who had authoritie by publike con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. We know how corrupt the ſtate of that people was then, and Luke will at length declare in the end of the chapter, that theſe men of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och were too ſtout and ſtubborne in receiuing the grace of Chriſte: and yet there remained this goodneſſe among them, that their aſſemblies were honeſtly and decently gouerned, for which cauſe ſuch euill fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red confuſion is ſo much the more ſhamefull, which is ſeene at this day among thoſe who will be counted Chriſtians. The Papiſts doe in deede ſing the ſcriptures in their churches with ſhrill and ſounding voice, but in an vnknowen tongue, ſo that the people reape no frute therby. There is ſeldome any doctrine vſed, and it were better for the wicked brablers euen then to hold their peace, who thruſt in their own vncleane inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in ſteed of the word of God, and pollute with the ſtink of their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pietie, whatſoeuer is holy.</p>

                  <hi>Men and brethren,</hi> Becauſe Paul knew that there were many baſtard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ſonnes of Abraham, or ſuch as wer growen out of kind, he calleth the Iewes to whom he ſpeaketh by a double name. Firſt he calleth them bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, hauing reſpect vnto common kinred, notwithſtanding he ſheweth therewithall that they ſhal be true Iſraelites, if they feare God, &amp; that euen then they are likewiſe true hearers, becauſe the feare of the Lorde is the beginning of wiſdome. In like ſort hee maketh the faithfull atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, and purchaſeth audience among them: as if he ſhould ſay, Seeing many boaſt that they are ſonnes of Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who were vnworthie of ſuch honour, ſhew your ſelues to be no baſtardly ſeede. Let vs learne by this that it is not a fault common to one age onely, that good and ſincere worſhippers being mixed with hypocrites haue the name of the church common among them. But we muſt haue a great care hereof, that wee be in deed, that which wee are called: which thing the true feare of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie GOD will bring to paſſe: and not the externall profeſſion alone.</p>
               <p n="17">17. <hi>The God of this people.</hi> This preface did witneſſe that Paul did goe about no new thing, which might leade away the people from the lawe of Moſes. There is but one God who is God of all nations: but hee calleth him God of that people, to whom he had bound himſelfe, &amp; who was worſhipped amongſt the poſteritie of Abraham, amongſt whom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone true and pure religion was to be found. To the ſame ende tendeth that which is added immediately, <hi>Hee choſe our</hi> fathers. For he teſtifieth by theſe wordes, that he ſeeketh nothing leſſe, then that they may fall away from the true and liuing God, who hath ſeperated them from the reſidue of the worlde. Neither doe I doubt, but that hee did more mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly expreſſe that he did not preach to them an vnknowen or ſtrange God: but the ſame who reuealed himſelfe long agoe to their fathers: ſo that he doth brieflie comprehende the ſound knowledge of god groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the law, that their faith conceiued out of the law &amp; prophets may continue firme. Notwithſtanding he doth in the mean ſeaſon commend and ſet foorth the free loue of God toward that people. For howe came it to paſſe that onely the children of Abraham were the church and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of God, ſaue onely becauſe it pleaſed God to diſceuer them from other nations? For there was no worthineſſe to diſtinguiſh them but the difference began at the loue of God, wherwith he did freely loue Abraham.</p>
               <pb n="303" facs="tcp:7788:160"/>
               <p>Of this free loue of God Moſes doth oftententimes put the Iewes in minde: as Deut. 4.7.10.14.32. and in other places:<note place="margin">Deut. 4.34. and 7.8.</note> wherein god did ſet before vs a mirrour of his wonderfull counſell: in that finding no excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie in Abraham, an obſcure perſon and miſerable idolatrer, hee doth notwithſtanding preferre him before all the worlde. Furthermore this election was common to all people, as was alſo circumciſion, whereby god did adopt to himſelf the ſeed of Abraham: but there was alſo a more hidden election, whereby ſeuering to himſelfe a fewe of many children of Abraham, he did declare that not all who came of the ſeede of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham according to the fleſh, are reckoned in the ſpirituall ſtock.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He did driue out a people.</hi> Paul teacheth that all thoſe benefits which god beſtowed afterward vpon the Iewes, did proceed and flow from that free fauour which he did beare toward their fathers. For this was the cauſe that they wer deliuered by the wonderful power of god, &amp; brought by his hand into the poſſeſſion of the land of Canaan, after that he had driuen out ſo many nations for their ſake. For it is no ſmall matter for the land to be depriued of her inhabitors, that ſhe might receiue ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. This is the fountaine and roote of all good thinges, whereunto Paul calleth vs, that god choſe the fathers. This was the reaſon &amp; cauſe which moued god to ſo great patience, that hee would not caſt off that rebellious people, who ſhoulde otherwiſe haue deſtroyed themſelues a thouſand times with their owne wickedneſſe. Therefore where the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture maketh mention that their ſinnes were pardoned, it ſaith, that god remembred his couenant. He ſaith that they were exalted, though they were ſtrangers, that they may remember how worthie &amp; gorgeous their deliuerance was.</p>
               <p n="18">18 <hi>He ſuffered their manners.</hi> The compounde verbe hath greater force and grace in the greeke, whereby the mercifulneſſe of god is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, in ſuffering the people whom he knew to be ſtubborne and diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient. And Paul giueth vs to vnderſtand againe, that the election of god was the cauſe, that his goodneſſe did ſtriue with the wickedneſſe of the people. Notwithſtanding wee muſt note that god did ſo take pittie vpon his elect people, whiles that he will continue firme in his purpoſe, that he did notwithſtanding ſharply puniſhe the rebellious and wicked. Hee ſpared the people in deed, ſo that hee did not quite deſtroy them, as he might by good right, but hee founde alſo meanes,<note place="margin">Iſai. 10.22.</note> that their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe might not remaine vnpuniſhed. And ſo that of Iſaias was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, If the multitude ſhall be as the ſand of the ſea, the remnant ſhalbe ſaued.</p>
               <p n="20">20 <hi>He gaue them iudges.</hi> Vnder this name the ſcripture comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth rulers &amp; gouernours, and here is another teſtimonie of the infinite goodnes of god toward the Iewes, in that he pardoned ſo many back ſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For it is likely that Paul handled thoſe things more at large which Luke gathereth briefly. And we know what was the eſtate of the people, during al that time, ſeing that through vntamed wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tonnes they did euer now &amp; then ſhake off the yoke. They were often puniſhed with
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:7788:161" rendition="simple:additions"/> moſt greeuous plagues, yet ſo ſoone as they wer once humbled, God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered them from the tyrannie of their enemies: So that hee ſaued the body therof aliue amidſt many deaths, foure whole ages and one halfe. And hereby it appeareth how vnworthie they were of the fauor of God which they did deſpice and reiect ſo often, vnleſſe the conſtancie of the election had gotten the victorie. For how is it that God is neuer weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but that he keepeth promiſe with thoſe who are truce breakers an hundreth times, ſaue only becauſe turning his eyes toward his Chriſte, hee hath not ſuffered his couenaunt grounded in him to decay or pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhe.</p>
               <p n="21">21 <hi>Afterward they deſired.</hi> And this chaunge was all one as if they would quite and manifeſtly ouerthrowe the gouernment which he had appointed,<note place="margin">1. Sa. 8.5.7.</note> whereof God himſelfe complaineth in Samuel. But the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie of the election ſaued them from beeing puniſhed as ſuche mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe did deſerue: yea the wicked and vnlawefull deſire of the people, was to God a new &amp; vncredible occaſion to erect the kingdome whence Chriſt ſhoulde afterwarde come. For how is it that the ſcepter came to the tribe of Iuda, ſaue only becauſe the people were deſirous to haue a king? And aſſuredly the people dealt wickedly, but God who knoweth how to vſe euill things well,<note place="margin">1. Sa. 15.28.</note> turned that offence into ſafetie. Whereas Saul was throwen downe from the kingdome, it ſerued to reprooue the fault of the people, but immediately when the kingdome is eſtabliſhed, Dauids familie,<note place="margin">Gen. 49.10.</note> the propheſie of Iacob was verified.</p>
               <p n="22">22 <hi>I haue found Dauid my ſeruant.</hi> This title was not ſo much cited in praiſe of the perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as that Paul might make the Iewes more atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiue to receiue Chriſt. For the Lord doth teſtifie that his mind was thorowly ſet vpon Dauid for no light cauſe, but he commendeth in him ſom ſingular thing, and by extolling him ſo highly, his intent is to lift vp the mindes of the faithfull vnto Chriſt in his perſon.<note place="margin">Pſal. 89.21.</note> The place is taken out of the foureſcore and ninth Pſalme. Only Paul putteth in that which is not there to be found, that Dauid was the ſonne of Iſai, which amplifieth the grace of God. For, ſeeing that Iſai was a breeder of cattell, it was a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull worke of God, to take the leaſt of his ſonnes from the ſheepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foldes, and to place him in the throne of the kingdome. By the worde <hi>found,</hi> God meaneth that he had gotten ſuch a man as hee woulde. Not that Dauid had brought to paſſe by his owne trauell and induſtrie, that he ſhould meete God, being ſuch a one, but the phraſe is taken from the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cuſtome of men. But the queſtion is, Seing that Dauid ſel to gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſly, how God giueth teſtimonie of his continual obedience. We may anſwere two waies, for God had reſpect rather vnto the continual courſe of his life, then vnto euery of his particular actions: ſecondly, he did thus ſet him foorth, not ſo much for his owne merite as for his Chriſts ſake. Aſſuredly hee had deſerued by one wicked fact eternall deſtruction for him and his, and ſo much as in him laid, the way of the bleſſing of God was ſhut vp, that there might nothing but vipers ſeed come of Berſabe. But that ſo filthie a fact,<note place="margin">2. Sam, 11.2</note> in the death of Vrias, turneth to a contrary end by the wonderfull counſell of God, becauſe Salomon is borne and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:7788:161"/> of that vnlooked for wedlock which was full of treacherie, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally polluted with many ſpots. And though Dauid ſinned greeuouſly, yet becauſe he followed God all the courſe of his life, he is ptayſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception, that he ſhewed himſelfe obedient to God in all thinges. Though (as I haue ſaid before) the ſpirit carieth vs vnto a farther thing,<note place="margin">Mat. 22.42. and 15.22.</note> yea the common calling of all the faithfull in Chriſt the head is here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>painted out to vs,</p>
               <p n="23">23 <hi>According to promiſe.</hi> This clauſe doth alſo proue that whiche I haue alreadie ſaid elswhere, that in ſending Chriſt, the Lorde had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect only vnto his owne faithfulneſſe and goodneſſe. For hee ſent him becauſe he had promiſed ſo to doe. And as the promiſe doth teſtifie that ſaluation was free, ſo it doeth alſo purchaſe no ſmall credite to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel: becauſe it appeareth by this that Chriſt came not at a ſodaine, of whom there was neuer any thing ſpoken: but that he who was promiſed from the beginning, was now giuen in his time. But the promiſes which Luke here toucheth by the way, are famous and well knowen. And they were ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon among the Iewes, that they called Chriſt commonly, by no other name, but the ſonne of Dauid. Hee ſaith that Ieſus was raiſed vp to Iſrael, becauſe though ſaluation belong to all the whole world,<note place="margin">Rom. 15.8.</note> yet was he firſt a miniſter of circumciſion to fulfill the promiſes made to the fathers. He tranſlateth the Hebrew name <hi>Ieſus</hi> into <hi>ſoter</hi> in Greeke. So that he vttered one thing twiſe: and yet here is no ſuperfluous repetiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: becauſe he meant to declare that Chriſte is in deede and doeth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme that which the name giuen him by God by the voice of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, doth import.</p>
               <q>
                  <p n="24">
                     <hi>24</hi> After that Iohn had preached before the face of his entrance, the baptiſme of repentance to all the people of Iſrael:</p>
                  <p n="25">
                     <hi>25</hi> And when Iohn fulfilled his courſe, he ſaid: Whom doe yee thinke me to be? I am not, But beholde, he commeth after mee, whoſe ſhoe latchets I am not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie to looſe.</p>
                  <p n="26">
                     <hi>26</hi> Men and brethren, children of the generation of Abraham, and thoſe who among you feare God, to you is the worde of this ſaluation ſent.</p>
               </q>
               <p n="24">24 Wee knowe what office Iohn had, to wit, to prepare the way of the Lorde. Therefore Paule bringeth in his teſtimonie, that hee may proue to the Iewes, that he preached no falſe Chriſt, but the true Chriſt of God, whom that moſt famous forerunner had before commended: not that mans teſtimonie is ſufficient to proue ſo weightie a matter: but there was another reſpect to be had to Iohn, whom all men almoſt did thinke to be a prophet of God. Therefore hence commeth the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the teſtimonie, that a cryer ſent from heauen, and no priuate man, ſpeaketh of Chriſte. And Paule reciteth two thinges ſummarilie concerning Iohn, that he taught the baptiſme of repentaunce before Chriſt his comming: Secondly, that caſting from him of his owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde the title and honour of the Meſſias, hee ſubmitted himſelfe to Chriſt.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>The baptiſme of repentance.</hi> Baptiſme brought in contrarie to the rite and cuſtome of the lawe was a token of great alteration. For it was vnlawful to renue any thing before Chriſtes comming. The Iewes had in deed in the lawe their baptiſmes or waſhinges which were alſo exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes of repentaunce, but Iohn was the authour of new and ſtrange bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, or rather the miniſter, who put them in hope of the reſtoring long looked for and deſired. When he calleth it the baptiſme of repentance, he doth not exclude remiſſion of ſinnes, but hee ſpeaketh according to the circumſtance of the place, becauſe this baptiſme was a preparation vnto the faith of Chriſt. And we muſt note the phraſe, that hee prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched baptiſme: Whereby we are taught, that the ſacramentes are then rightly adminiſtred, when doctrine is ioyned with the viſible figure. For the mouth of the baptiſer muſt not be dumb: becauſe the ſigne is vaine without doctrine.</p>
               <p n="25">25 <hi>When Iohn fulfilled his courſe.</hi> The ſecond member of the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie, that when Iohn drew neere to the end of his courſe, hee ſent his diſciples to Chriſt. For he had faſhioned the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before with the rudimente of baptiſme, and then he ſent them to Chriſt (as they ſay) from hand to hand. And this interrogatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Whom do ye thinke me to be? is not a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion of one that doubteth. For Iohn reproueth and chideth the Iewes, becauſe they did falſly giue to him the honour of the Meſſias, though it may be read in one text, I am not he whom you take me to be: yet the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reading is more vſuall, as it hath alſo greater force to refute the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror. Furthermore, his teſtimonie doth deſerue greater credite, in that he doth willingly refuſe the honour offered him (which he might haue take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to himſelfe not without commendation) and doth ſubmit himſelf to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. There cannot aſſuredly be any ſuſpition of ambition, or of ſeeking after honour here, which may diſcredite his words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Behold he commeth.</hi> That is, he is about to come: the Hebrew phraſe which is common enough euen in the new teſtament, whereas he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth that he is vnworthie to looſe the latchets of Chriſtes ſhoes: It is a prouerbiall figure, wherby he abaſeth himſelfe ſo much as he can, leaſt his greatneſſe darken Chriſt his glory: for he meant to do that faithfully which was giuen him in charge, that Chriſt alone might haue the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence. Therfore he ſaith: that how great ſoeuer he be, yet he is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in reſpect of Chriſt. For though God feruants haue their dignity: yet being compared to Chriſt, they muſt all be as nothing, that he alone may excell: as we ſee all ſtarres vaniſh away, that they may giue place to the brightneſſe of the Sunne.</p>
               <p n="26">26 <hi>Men and brethren.</hi> Paul doth againe prick forward the Iewes to embrace Chriſt. For this ought to haue raiſed no ſmal ſtudie and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiueneſſe in their mindes, when as they ſaw their ſaluation handled, and that the meſſage of ſaluation was appointed properly for them. He cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth them <hi>children</hi> of Abraham, not only for honours ſake, but that they may know that they be heires of eternall life, and hee ſpeaketh them ſo fayre, that it might not greeue them to depart from the Scribes and prieſts whom they worſhipped: becauſe they muſt needs receiue Chriſt:
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:7788:162"/> Furthermore we muſt remember that which I ſaide before: though the gate of the kingdome of heauen were ſet open to the Gentiles, yet were not the Iewes throwne downe from their eſtate, but were counted the firſt begotten in Gods familie. Therfore is it that he ſaith, that ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was ſent to them, becauſe they wer firſt in order: yet becauſe the carnall kinred was of it ſelfe of no great importance, and the vngodlines of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny brake out, Paul ſpeaketh ſpecially vnto the true worſhippers of God, ſignifying, that word<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For Ieruſalem was Gods ſanctuarie, the kinges ſeat, the fountaine of truth, and the light of all the whole worlde, but Chriſt was put to death there. Furthermore, nothing could ſeeme more abſurd to looke too, then to receiue him, who was caſt out of the temple of God: and to ſeeke the doctrine of ſaluation any where els, then there whence God himſelfe had teſtified it ſhould come. Moreouer by beleeuing in Chriſt they ſeemed to make a departure from the church. And therfore this one obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g enough to refute al Paul his ſermon, why doeſt thou force vpon vs vnder colour of Gods co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant, a man whom the principall part of the holy people condemned?

                  </gap>neth it alſo to the contrarie part. For ſeeing that the author of life was deſpiced &amp; reiected at Ieruſalem, Paul exhorteth the men of Antioch, at leaſt thoſe who among them feared God, that they receiue him ſo much the more ioyfully. For this doth the caſuall worde declare: as if hee ſhould haue ſaide, ſeeing that Ieruſalem knewe not her good, it behoueth you to bee the more awaked and infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, leaſt the ſame vnthankfulneſſe and frowardneſſe bee founde in you.</p>
               <p>But hee vſeth another reaſon to remoue the offence, to wit, that their
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:7788:163"/> vngodlineſſe was ſo farre from diminiſhing any whit of Chriſt his diuine excellencie, that it ought rather to ſerue to proue &amp; eſtabliſhe the ſame.

It muſt needes bee that Chriſt ſhoulde bee reiected of the chiefe: for it was ſo foretolde, <hi>The</hi> ſtone which the builders refuſed,<note place="margin">Pſal. 118.22</note> hath God made the head of the corner. Chriſte muſt needes haue been condemned among the wicked, that he might acquit vs before god: it was expedient that ſinnes ſhould be laid vpon him, that he might make ſatisfaction for the ſame: that he ſhould be offered vpon the croſſe, that the ſhadowiſh ſacrifices of the law might ceaſe. For euen the ſcripture contained theſe things. Iſa. 53. Dan. 9.<note place="margin">Iſai. 53.4.5. Dan. 9.26.</note> Therefore the more violently the captaines of the people ſought to extinguiſhe Chriſt, they did in very deed proue him to be Chriſte, and the Lord did wonderfully deceiue them, ſo that their obſtinate impietie doeth more edifie the faith of the godly, then deſtroy it. Of the ſame ſort are almoſt all offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which lead away weake and inconſtant ſoules from Chriſt. For if they would throughly ponder the whole proceſſe of the worke of God, there ſhould be matter of confirmation, where they faint. Therefore it commeth to paſſe for the moſt part that we be troubled with offences &amp; ſtumbling blockes, becauſe whiles we behold thoſe things which belong to Chriſte with poreblind eyes, wee imagine that to bee blacke which is white. And we ſee how far Paul is from diſſimulation, and how freely he profeſſeth the truth of the matter, that Chriſt was hated not only of the common ſort, but alſo of the chief chieftaines, &amp; that he was not hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at by a few, but oppreſſed by the wicked conſpiracie of al the people. That was hard &amp; hateful at the firſt conflict, but Paul oppoſeth a more ſtrong engine, that God vſed them againſt their willes as a touch ſtone whereby he might trie his ſonne. Seeing that the Goſpel ſtandeth in the ſame ſtate at this day, let vs not bee aſhamed with Paul to confeſſe, that the proude princes of the worlde, and thoſe who beare the greateſt ſway in the church, are the deadly enemies of Chriſt, ſeeing that doth rather turne to Chriſtes prayſe then reproch. For by this meanes is the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture fulfilled.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seeing they knew him not.</hi> Though deliberate malice did enforce the rulers to oppreſſe Chriſt, yet doth Paul truly impute it to ignorance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe otherwiſe they would neuer haue crucified the Lord of glory. 1. Cor. 2.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 28. 2 Cor. 3.15.</note> For the malice of the wicked is like to raging madneſſe, and in ſeeing it doth not ſee. Vndoubtedly, we ned not doubt of this that they were depriued of a ſound minde and the light of the Spirit, who were not afraide to fight againſt God to their owne deſtruction. Again he hitteth them in the teeth with ignorance of the ſcripture. And leaſt any ſhoulde obiect that he ſpeaketh of ſome dark and vnknowne matter: he addeth alſo, that he doth ſpeak of no other propheſies then of thoſe which are read euery Sabboth day, as if he ſhould ſay, that the oracles of ſcripture are moſt plain &amp; known to the moſt ignorant, &amp; yet they knew the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not.
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:7788:163" rendition="simple:additions"/> Thus doth Paul teach, how monſtrous their vnbeleefe was, that he may make the hearers loath it. And by this example are wee taught that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Lorde appeare to vs by the ſcripture, yet all men haue not eyes. After that, alſo the blockiſhneſſe of the nation waxed more groſſe: as Paul ſaieth elswhere, that there is a veile put before their face, that they cannot ſee Moſes when hee is preſent. In the meane ſeaſon wee muſt note that we are recalled to the ſcripture, leaſt the authoritie of great men deceiue vs, neither is there any cauſe why any man inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting to himſelfe a preiudice according to the wicked meaning of other men, ſhould thinke that he is acquitted. For Paul exhorteth the men of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioth to iudge out of the ſcripture againſt the viſured gouernours of the church. For, for this cauſe is it giuen, that it may be read: and reading is not appointed in vaine by the Lord, but that al godly men may thereby profit, and iudge what is right.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This they fulfilled.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 3.23. Act. 4.28.</note> So that we ſee that not only creatures void of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, but euen the very Diuell and alſo the wicked are ſubiect to the power of God: that hee may execute by them that which with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf he hath decreed. The ſame had we in the thirde &amp; fourth chapters, that when the enemies of Chriſt did moſt of all rage to deſtroy him, yet coulde they not obtaine their purpoſe: but rather they brought that to paſſe with their owne hands, which God had in his counſel determined: which thing maketh not a litle for co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendation of Gods truth: becauſe he is not only of ſufficient power to perfourme thoſe things which hee hath promiſed: but alſo thoſe who goe about to bring his counſels to nought, doe their indeuour to eſtabliſh them, though it be againſt their will. For how ſhould not the truth of God ſtand which the chiefeſt ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies are enforced to fulfill. Yet wiſdome is neceſſarie here, leaſt we ioin God and Satan together. For the Iewes are not therefore excuſable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they fulfilled the ſcriptures: becauſe we muſt conſider their wicked will, and not the euent which they did not looke for: yea which ought to be counted a myracle. If we looke into their worke by it ſelfe, it is quite contrarie to God. But as god doth in the Sun and other planets by won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull cunning temper contrary motions, &amp; ſuch as ſtriue among them ſelues: ſo he directeth the peruers indeuours of the wicked by his ſecret power vnto another end then they thought vppon and did deſire, leaſt they ſhould do any thing but that which he would. They in deed, as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching themſelues do contrary to his will: but it falleth out according to the will of God after an incomprehenſible maner. Foraſmuch as this courſe is contrary to nature, no maruell if the wiſdome of the fleſh ſee it not. Therfore it muſt be diſcerned with the eie of faith, or rather it muſt be reuerenced: &amp; thoſe dogs who barke againſt it, muſt be deſpiſed with their wantonneſſe.</p>
               <p n="28">28 <hi>When as they found no cauſe of death.</hi> It was very appertinent to the matter that they ſhould know that Chriſt was put to death giltleſſe, For we could not haue bin iuſtified by his death, if he had ſuffered death for his owne euill deedes. Therefore it was requiſite that he ſhoulde bee giltleſſe, that his death might be a ſatisfaction for the ſins of the worlde.
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:7788:164"/> And vndoubtedly I thinke that Paul did plainly declare, that Pilat con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned Chriſt, not according to the office of a iudge, but that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented that he ſhould be put to death, after that he was ouercome with the vngodly requeſts of the people: and alſo that the Iewes were driuen by luſt, and not enforced by reaſon to deſire Chriſtes death. For it ſtood him vpon to terrifie the hearers, that they might not couple themſelues to ſo wicked a fact. But Luke doth nowe in few wordes ſet downe after his common cuſtom, thoſe thinges which Paule did then more at large declare.</p>
               <p n="29">29 <hi>When they had fulfilled all things.</hi> To wit, which it pleaſed God ſhould be done by them. For they did ſo handle Chriſte, that there was nothing of the propheſies of the ſcripture left vnfulfilled. By this means is the ſtumbling block (which the vnderſtanding of the fleſh conceiueth by reaſon of the ignominie of the croſſe) taken away, that the ſon of god was not laid ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the furious furie of the wicked: but he obeyed his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers decree.<note place="margin">Mat. 27.57.</note> Furthermore it doth alſo in ſcripture appear, what co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was appointed for him in times paſt. Whereas he ſaith that Chriſt was buried by the ſame which had ſlaine him: it ſeemeth contrary to the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorie of the Goſpel: but it may be that Luke did take the word <hi>buried</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definitely. And if it pleaſe you to referre it vnto the ſame it ſhall be Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necdoche. For he was buried with Pilat his leaue, and at the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and pleaſure of the prieſtes, there were watchmen ſet to watch the graue. Therefore though Ioſeph and Nicodemus did burie Chriſt: that is aſcribed vnproperly and yet not abſurdly to the Iewes: becauſe it is not Paules drift in this place to commend the good deede, but to proue Chriſt his reſurrection: becauſe God tooke him out of the graue whom his enemies had ſhut vp there. Therefore hee giueth vs to vnderſtande that the bodie of Chriſte was not taken thence priuilie or by ſtealth, but that it was laide in a place both famous and knowen to the aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, and ſo conſequently, that euen they were ſet to watch it, &amp; yet for all this it was not found: Whence wee may gather the certaintie of the reſurrection.</p>
               <p n="30">30 <hi>God hath raiſed him vp.</hi> The death of Chriſt was the ſaluation of the godly, yet ioyned with the reſurrection: therfore doth Paul ſtand longer vpon this ſecond point. For hee ſhoulde neuer haue perſwaded his hearers that they were to ſeeke ſaluation in Chriſtes death, vnleſſe the power of Almightie GOD had appeared in rayſing Chriſte from death.</p>
               <p n="31">31 After that he hath ſaid that Chriſt came out of the graue, which was beſet with the hired miniſters of the aduerſaries: hee addeth nowe that hee appeared to many of the diſciples, which bare faithful witneſſe to the people. And he calleth them <hi>witneſſes</hi> either in reſpect of their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice:<note place="margin">Acts. 1.8.</note> becauſe they were choſen for this purpoſe, as we haue alredy ſaid in the firſt chapter: or els declaring ſimplie, that they profeſſed openly and freely that which they knewe concerning Chriſte. Whereuppon it followeth that the matter was made knowen openly at Ieruſalem. And the proofe was not ſo light, becauſe in the fearefull power of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:7788:164"/> who were readie and bent to reſiſt, and did omit nothing, there were notwithſtanding ſuch as did openly affirme that Chriſt roſe again, and were alſo ſuch as ſaw that thing with their eies: for if there had bin any refutation in readineſſe, the Scribes woulde not haue neglected it.</p>

               <p n="32">32 <hi>We preach to you glad tidings.</hi> Hee doth nowe challenge to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe the office and honour of an Apoſtle, that he may be heard as a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful miniſter of God. And he ſaith the ſumme of the Ambaſſage inioyned him, is, that that is reuealed &amp; giuen in their time which was promiſed in times paſt. And in fewe wordes doeth he comprehend many &amp; great matters. Firſt, hee giueth them to vnderſtande that hee bringeth in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which is new or contrary to the law and prophets, but that he did reueale the fulfilling of that doctrine which they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues did confeſſe and were perſwaded to haue been deliuered by God. Whereupon it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth that they cannot refuſe that which hee offereth them, but they ſhall breake the couenant made with the fathers by God, ſo much as in them ſhall lie: ſecondly, hee commendeth the faithfulneſſe of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it doth now in very deed appeare, that there was nothing promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in times paſt vnaduiſedly or in vaine: but he doth chiefly extoll the greatneſſe of the grace giuen at length in Chriſte. For we muſt note the compariſon betweene them and the fathers, when hee ſaieth, that they had gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that which was promiſed to the fathers. For the more liberal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie the grace of God is powred out vppon them, the more filthie ſhall their vnthankfulneſſe bee, if they ſhall deſpice or loath that vneſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble good thing. For what els were this, but to caſt downe at their feete a treaſure euen reached out to them that they might take holde thereof, and ſo conſequently laid in their lap, the hope whereof was reuerentlie embraced by the father when it was ſhewed them a farre off, and which they did foſter during their whole life? But ſome man may ask this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion concerning thoſe who liued vnder the law, whether euen they wer not made partakers of the promiſes? I anſwere, that there is ſuch a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie of the ſame grace amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g vs which doth not hinder the lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g diſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. But this was Paul his meaning, that their faith ſtood as it were in doubt,
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:7788:165"/> vntill Chriſt appeared, in whome all the promiſes of God are Yea and Amen:<note place="margin">2. Cor. 1.19.20.</note> as he teacheth, 2. Cor. 1. Therefore we be the heires of the ſame kingdome of heauen, and partakers of the ſame ſpirituall good thinges, which God beſtoweth vpon his children: alſo God gaue to them ſome taſt of his loue in this life, as we taſt him now. But Chriſt who is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of all good things and of eternall life, was only promiſed to them but he is giuen to vs: and they deſired him as being far off, we inioy him being preſent.</p>
               <p n="33">33 <hi>To their children, namely to vs.</hi> It is certaine that Paule ſpeaketh of naturall children, who had their beginning of the holy fathers, which wee muſt therefore note, becauſe certaine brainſicke men drawing all thinges vnto allegories, dreame that there is no reſpect to be had in this place of kinred, but only of faith. And with ſuch an inuentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they make the holie couenaunt of God of none effect, where it is ſaid, I will be thy God, and the God of thy ſeed. It is faith (ſay they) alone, which maketh vs the children of Abraham.<note place="margin">Gen. 17.7.</note> But I ſay on the other ſide, that, euen thoſe who are borne the children of Abraham according to the fleſh, are alſo counted the ſpirituall children of God, vnleſſe they growe out of kinde through vnbeleefe. For the boughs bee naturally holy, becauſe they ſpring from an holy roote,<note place="margin">Rom. 11.16.</note> vntill they become profane through their owne fault. And aſſuredly it is Paule his drifte, to allure the Iewes vnto Chriſte, and that he may doe this, they muſt bee diſtinguiſhed from the common ſort by ſome priuiledge, and yet it followeth not thereuppon (which theſe knaues doe odiouſly obiect) that the gtace of God is tyed to the carnall ſeed. Becauſe though the promiſe of life came by inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to the poſteritie of Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: yet many were depriued by their vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe. Therfore faith is the cauſe that of a great multitude, only a few are counted children. And that is the double electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whereof I ſpake before. The one common to all the whole nation alike: becauſe the firſt adoptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God containeth the whole familie of Abraham. The other which is reſtrained vnto the ſecret counſel of god: and is at length eſtabliſhed by faith, that it may be confirmed to men. Therefore Paul doth well &amp; tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie affirme that that was perfourmed to the Iewes, which god had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to the fathers. For it was promiſed to them alſo, as Zacharias ſaith in his ſong, The oth which he ſware to our father Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that he would giue himſelfe for vs, &amp;c. And yet the worthineſſe of that nation doth not hinder but that the grace of Chriſt may alſo ſpread it ſelfe throughout the whole world: bicauſe the firſt begotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath the firſt degree of honor, ſo that he doth notwithſtanding leaue the ſecond place to his brethren. For in that after the old people wer caſt off, the poſſeſſion of the church was left emptie for ſtrangers, it began to be a new occaſion of gathering the church of the Gentiles, but &amp; if that people had ſtood in the faieth, the Gentiles had been ioyned into the common ſocietie of honor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>After that he had raiſed Christ.</hi> The word <hi>raiſed,</hi> in my iudgement rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth farther, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it doth where it is ſhortly after repeated. For he doth not onely ſay that Chriſt roſe from the dead, but that he was appointed of god, and as it were brought to light by the hand of god, that he might
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:7788:165"/> fulfill the office of the Meſſias, as the ſcripture teacheth euery where, that kings and Prophets are raiſed vp. For the word <hi>anasteſai,</hi> is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times taken in this ſenſe: And this reaſon moueth me thus to thinke, becauſe God by ſending his ſonne into the world, did fulfill his promiſe made to his ſeruants in times paſt, by the effect it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Like as in the ſecond Pſalme.</hi> Though the Greeke bookes agree in the number, yet we muſt not paſſe ouer that which Eraſmus ſaith, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the old writers read the firſt Pſalme. And it may be that Luke wrot ſo. For that which at this day is counted the ſecond Pſalme, might haue bin called the firſt not without reaſon, ſeing that it is likely that the firſt Pſalme was added in ſteed of a Proeme by the Scribes and Prieſtes, by whoſe induſtrie the Pſalmes were gathered into one bodie. For the name of the authour is not ſet to it, and it doeth onely exhort to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate vpon the Law of God. But there is no great weight in that matter. For this is the chiefeſt thing, that we know how properly and how well Paul applieth the teſtimonie taken out of the Pſalme vnto the matter which he hath in hand. We do not denie that Dauid when he ſaw that he was on euery ſide aſſailed by his enimies, and that they were of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter power &amp; might, than that he was able to reſiſt them, doth ſet againſt them Gods aide, who he knew was the authour of his kingdome and Reigne. But foraſmuch as he was a figure of the true Meſſias, we know that thoſe things were ſhadowed in his perſon, which doe appertaine wholy and perfectly to the Meſſias alone. And the text it ſelf doth proue ſufficiently, that there is not onely a ſimple and bare thankeſgiuing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained there, agreeable to Dauids kingdome, but it is a higher prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie. For it is wel knowne that Dauid did in his life ſcarce taſt of the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth part of the glory which is ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of in this place, concerning which we haue ſpoken more at large Chapter 4. Now let vs looke nigher into the words, kings are in deed called ſonnes of God. Pſal. 82.6. But ſeing that God doth intend to prefer Dauid before all other kings, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt him out of the number of them: this title of honor is giuen to him principallie aboue all other: not becauſe ſo great honour reſteth in his perſon, becauſe by this meanes he ſhould paſſe the Angels, as it is in the Epiſt. to the Heb. 1. cha. Therfore he is thus gorgeouſly ſet out in reſpect of Chriſt, whoſe image he was, that God doth not take him for one of the common, ſort, or for ſome one of a great multitude, but he doth as it were acknowledge him to his onely begotten ſonne. The proofe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, Becauſe God did beget him, when he eſtabliſhed the kingdome in his hand. For that was not done by mans induſtrie, but God ſhewed from heauen the inuincible power of his hand, whereby it might plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeare that he reigned according to Gods counſel. Therefore this Begetting by him mentioned, muſt be referred vnto the vnderſtanding or knowledge of men: to wit, becauſe it was then openlie known that he was begotten of God, when as he was ſet vpon the throne of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome wonderfully, contrarie to the hope of all men, and did by the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly power of the Spirit breake infinit conſpiracies: becauſe hee could not reigne, vntill he had brought all nations round about him in ſubie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:7788:166"/> as if a certaine world were ſubdued. Now let vs come vnto Chriſt. He came not into the world without teſtimony, whereby he did proue that he was the ſon of God. For his glory did appeare, as became the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begotten ſon of god, as it is written Iohn. 1.14. and he ſaith euerywhere that he hath God for the witneſſe and maintainer of this honor. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God begat Chriſt, when he gaue him certaine markes, whereby he might be knowne to be his true &amp; liuely image &amp; ſon. And yet this doth not let, but that Chriſt is the wiſedome, begotten of the eternall father before time, but that is the ſecreat generation: &amp; now Dauid declareth that it was reuealed to men: ſo that the relation is as we haue ſaid, vnto men and not vnto God: becauſe that which was hidden in the heart of God, was made known to me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And it is a verye fine figure, becauſe Chriſt his diuinitie was no leſſe declared and eſtabliſhed, then if he had bin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten of God before the eyes of men. I know that Auguſtine his deepe ſight doth pleaſe ſome, that by to day is meant perpetuitie. But when as the ſpirit of God himſelf is his owne interpreter, &amp; whereas he doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound that by the mouth of Paul which he had ſaid by Dauid, we muſt not inuent any other ſenſe. And foraſmuch (as the ſame Paul doth wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes) that Chriſt was declared to be the ſon of god in power, when he roſe from the dead, we gather that this was the principal token of celeſtiall excellency, &amp; that the father did then bring him truly to light, that the world might know that he was begotten of him. Therefore though God began to raiſe Chriſt when he came into the world, yet his raiſing was then as it were perfect &amp; full: becauſe whereas he was humbled before, hauing taken as it were the forme of a ſeruant, he did then appeare to be the conqueror of death &amp; the Lord of life, ſo that he wanted nothing of that maieſty which was meet for the ſon of god, &amp; that for the onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten ſonne.</p>
               <p n="34">34 <hi>That he ſhould not returne.</hi> He addeth now the other member, that Chriſt was once raiſed from death that he may liue for euer, as Paul tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth Rom. 6.10.<note place="margin">Rom. 6.10.</note> He dieth no more, neither ſhall death haue dominion ouer him any more: becauſe he liueth to God. For the hope conceiued of Chriſt his reſurrection ſhould be ſlender and cold, if he were yet ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to deſtruction or to any change. Therefore he is ſaid to be entred into the kingdome of God, that he may alſo giue to his, eternal felicity, liuing for euer. For becauſe Chriſt roſe rather for our ſake then for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, the perpetuitie of life which the father hath giuen him, reacheth vnto vs all, and is ours. Notwithſtanding the place of Iſay which is here cited, ſeemeth to make but a litle for proofe of Chriſt his immortalitie, I will giue you the holy things of Dauid. But it is not ſo. For ſeing Iſaias ſpeaketh of the redemption promiſed to Dauid,<note place="margin">Iſai. 55.3.</note> and affirmeth that the ſame ſhalbe firme and ſtable, we doe well gather by this, the immortall kingdome of Chriſt wherein the eternitie of ſaluation is grounded. And Paul followed the Greek interpreters, when he put <hi>Holy things,</hi> for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. <hi>Cheſſed,</hi> which ſignifieth meeke, merciful and gentle, is wont by the Grecians to be tranſlated <hi>Holy.</hi> Therefore they tranſlated <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> of Dauid, the holy thinges of Dauid, whereas the Prophet meaneth rather the
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:7788:166"/> grace promiſed to Dauid. But Paul granted this to the ignorant and weake, who were better acquainted with the Greeke reading, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for as much as the force of the teſtimonie conſiſteth in another point. For this is Paul his meaning in ſumme, If the grace bee eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall which God ſaieth hee will giue in his ſonne, the life of his ſonne muſt be eternall, and not ſubiect to corruption. For wee muſt hold this rule, that all the promiſes of God are in Chriſt, yea and Amen:<note place="margin">2. Cor. 1.20</note> and that therefore they can not be of any force vnleſſe he do quicken them.</p>
               <p n="35">35 <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſuffer thy holy one.</hi> This place was likewiſe cited by Peter in the firſt ſermon ſet downe by Luke in the ſecond Chapt. where I expounded the ſame: therefore let the readers repaire thither.<note place="margin">Acts. 2.27.</note> Onely I will touch this briefly, that Dauid putteth two Hebrew words for the graue, as he vſeth repetitions commonly, the former whereof is deriued of deſiring or luſting, becauſe the graue deuoureth all things as an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatiable gulfe: &amp; the other of corruption: according to this etymologie Dauids meaning is faithfully expreſſed in Greeke. For the qualitie of the graue is noted, when as it receiueth the corpes, and doeth as it were ſwallow it vp, that it may rot there, and may at length periſh when it is conſumed. Paul affirmeth that that belongeth to Chriſt alone, that hee was free and ſaued from corruption. For though his bodie was laide in graue, corruption had notwithſtanding no title to it, ſeing that it laide there whole as in a bedde vntill the day of the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>
               <p n="37">37 <hi>When Dauid had ſerued his time.</hi> Leaſt any man ſhould thinke that that place entreateth of Dauid, Paul ſheweth briefely, that this agreeth not to Dauid in all points, whoſe corps was rotten in the graue. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it remaineth, that becauſe this was a priuiledge belonging to Chriſt alone, that Dauid Prophecied of him in Spirite. Neuertheles we muſt note the proportion betweene the members and the head: for as the truth of this prophecie was found whole and perfect in Chriſt alone as in the head: ſo it taketh place in all the members according to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and order of euerie man. And for as much as Chriſt roſe to this ende that hee may faſhion and make our baſe bodie like to his glorious bodie: vpon this condition do the godly go downe into the pit,<note place="margin">Phil. 3.21.</note> that rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tennes may not conſume their bodies. Therefore according to the hope of the reſurrection to come, Dauid ſaith by good right that he ſhall not ſee corruption: for that ought not altogither to be counted corruption, for which there is a better reſtoring prepared: for the bodies of the faithfull corrupt to this end, that they may put on bleſſed incorruption in their time. Yet this is no let, but that the eſtate of the head and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers may be farre vnlike, and that wee may follow the ſonne of God a farre off and laſily. Now we ſee that both things are true and fitlie ſaid, that Dauid and the reſt of the faithfull in as much as they ſhall be like to their head, ſhall not ſee corruption, and yet the ſonne of God alone ſhall be free from corruption wholly. We muſt note the phraſe when he ſaieth that Dauid ſerued his age, or the men of his time.</p>

               <p>The olde interpreter diſtinguiſheth it otherwiſe, and certein Greek copies agree therto: to wit, that Dauid ſerued the wil of God in his time. Which reading though it be to be allowed, yet it dooth not cauſe me to miſlike the other. For it is neither ſuperfluous nor colde, that he ſlept by the wil of God or the counſel of God: becauſe the meaning thereof is, that God in the death of Dauid did not forget that prophecie: as if he ſhould ſaie that the bodie of Dauid laid in the graue not without the counſel or purpoſe of God, vntil it ſhould riſe againe, that the effect of the prophecie might be extended vnto Chriſt. If no man miſlike that which I ſaie, we are taught heerby to what end men liue in the world, to wit, that one man maie help another. For euerie man doth not liue nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is born for himſelfe, but mankinde is knit togither with an holie knot. Therfore vnleſſe we be diſpoſed to ouerthrow the lawes of nature, let vs remember that we muſt not liue for our ſelues, but for our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. But heer maie a queſtion be asked whether we ought not alſo to care for our poſteritie? I anſwer that the miniſterie of the godlie is alſo profitable for the poſteritie: as we ſee that Dauid being dead doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit vs more at this daie, then a great part of thoſe which liue with vs: but Paul meaneth ſimplie, that the faithful during their whole life employ themſelues and their offices to help their neighbours, and that death is vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as a goale becauſe they haue made an end then, when the Lord calleth them out of the world. The ſum is, that we muſt haue reſpect firſt to our time, that we maie ſerue our brethren with whom, and among whom we lead our life: and ſecondlie we muſt do our indeuour that the fruit of our miniſterie maie redound vnto our poſteritie. Seing that God preſcribeth his ſeruants this law, their raſhnes cannot be excuſed, who faigne that the dead praie for vs, and that they doo no leſſe ſerue the Church, then whiles they liued.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>By the counſel of God he fel on ſleep.</hi> Paul might haue ſaid ſimplie, that Dauid died: he addeth by <hi>the counſel</hi> of God, that we maie know that that was not fulfilled in the perſon of the Prophet, which is read in the pſalme. Notwithſtanding we are taught that the bond of life and death is in like ſort appointed for vs by God, as it is. Pſa. 90.3. Thou ſendeſt out men and makeſt them to paſſe ouer, again thou ſaiſt: Come again ye children of men. Yea Plato ſetteth down this verie eloquentlie, that it is meet that men paſſe out of the world not without the leaue and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God, by whoſe hand they are placed there as a ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding for a time. And for this cauſe whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſpeaketh of Dauids death, he maketh menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the counſel of God, that we maie know that corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did not hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to him by chance, as if God had forgotten his promiſe: but that it came to paſſe by Gods prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, that the faithful might know that the prophecie was to be referred vnto another. <hi>To ſleep and to be laid vnto the Fathers,</hi> are formes of ſpeeches ſo wel knowen and ſo common, that they need no expoſition.</p>

And this is the principall point, to know what good things we haue by the comming of Chriſt, and what we are to hope for at his hands. And although Luke ſetteth downe in a worde that Paul preached of the benefits of Chriſt: yet there is no cauſe why any man ſhould doubt but that ſo great matters were handled weightily and onely according as their dignitie did require. By this word <hi>Be it knowne</hi> vnto you, Paul meaneth that nothing ſhould hinder them from knowing ſuch an excellent &amp; plain matter ſaue only ſloth: &amp; that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was an abſurd thing that thoſe benifits of God ſhould be hidden from the faithfull, which were offered by Chriſt. For he was ſent with the ſhrill preaching of the Goſpel, which our faith ought to heare, that it may enter into the ſure poſſeſſion of his good things. For we muſt know what he is that we may inioy him truely. Forgiuenes of ſinnes is ſet firſt, whereby God doth reconcile vs vnto himſelf. That which God will haue preached to all his people, doeth he ſhewe to be neceſſarie for all men. For Paul ſpeaketh not to one or two, but to all the Iewes which were at Antioch. Therefore we muſt firſt marke that we be all enimies to God through ſinnes 2. Chapt. Colloſ. Whereupon it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that we are all excluded from the kingdome of God, and are giuen ouer to eternall death, vntill God receiue vs to fauour by the free for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueneſſe of ſinnes. We muſt alſo note this, that God doth pardon to vs our ſinnes, and that he is reconciled through the Mediator, becauſe like as without him there is no ſatiſfaction, ſo neither is there any pardon or forgiueneſſe of guiltines. Theſe be principles of our faith which are not learned in the ſchooles of the Philoſophers, That all mankinde is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, and drowned in ſinne, that there is in vs no righteouſnes which is able to reconcile vs to God: that the onely hope of ſaluation reſteth in his mercie, whiles that he doth freely forgiue vs: and that thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine vnder the gilt, which flie not vnto Chriſt, and ſeeke not forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in his death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And from all things.</hi> He doth ſecreatly preuent that which might ſeem contrary to the former doctrine. For looke how many ceremonies of the Law there were, ſo many exerciſes were there to obtaine remiſſion of ſinnes. Therefore the Iewes might readily obiect, if he alone doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile God to vs, our ſinnes being done away, to what end ſerue ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny waſhings and ſacrifices, which we haue hitherto vſed according to the preſcript of the Law? Therefore leaſt the Ceremonies of the Law hinder the Iewes, Paul teacheth that Chriſt doth that, which they were
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:7788:168"/> not able to do. Not that Paul ſpake ſo briefly and compendiouſly (for he did not hope that the Iewes would at the firſt come vnto Chriſt, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting from them ſodainly the affiance which they had in the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Law) but it was ſufficient for Luke briefly to collect the ſum of thoſe things which he then taught in iuſt and due order. His meaning is, that the Mediator tooke away that let from the Iewes, wherein they did ſticke. The ceremoniall Law ought in deede to haue bin a ſchoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter to leade them by the hand vnto Chriſt: all rites commanded by God were helps to help and further their faith: but as men vſe prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterouſly to corrupt the holy ordinances of God, they ſtopt the way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore themſelues by their ceremonies, &amp; they ſhut the gate of faith, that they could not come to Chriſt. They thought they had righteouſnes in ſacrifices, that by waſhings was gotten true cleannes, that god was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with them ſo ſoone as they had ended their external pompe: in ſum, forſaking the bodie they laid hold vpon vain ſhadowes. God did in deed appoint no vnprofitable or vaine thing in the Law. Wherefore ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies were ſure and vndoubted teſtimonies of remiſſion of ſins. For God did not lye in theſe words, Let the ſinner doe ſacrifice and his iniquitie ſhalbe purged. But as Chriſt was the end of the Law, and the heauenly patterne of the tabernacle, ſo the force and effect of all Ceremonies did depend vpon him. Whereby it is proued that they were vaine ſhadowes, when he was ſet aſide. Now we ſee Pauls drift and purpoſe, to wit, that he meant to draw away the Iewes from the falſe and peruerſe confidence which they repoſed in the Law, leaſt being puffed vp, they ſhould thinke that they had no need of Chriſts helpe,<note place="margin">Heb. 8.5.</note> or leaſt they ſhould ſeeke onely externall felicitie in him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Be iustified in the Law.</hi> This place doth plainly ſhew, what the word Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie doth import in all other places where it is vſed: to wit, to be deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red &amp; acquitted. There was mention made of remiſſion of ſins, Paul af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth that there is no other way whereby we can obtain the ſame but the grace of Chriſt. Leaſt any man ſhould obiect that there be remedies to be found in the law: he anſwereth that ther was in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no force. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſenſe is plain, That they cannot be iuſtified from ſin in the law, bicauſe the rites of the law were neither iuſt nor lawful prices to remoue giltines, they were nothing worth of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to deſerue righteouſnes, neither were they ſufficient recompences to appeaſe God. Certainely it cannot be denied (but wickedly) that that iuſtification annexed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins, is as it were the meanes &amp; way to obtaine the ſame. For what elſe doth Paul go about, but to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firm that ſaying, that our ſins are forgiue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs through the benefit of Chriſt: by anſwering contrary obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? And he proueth it, becauſe neither ſatiſfactions, neither al the rites of the law can iuſtifie vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſin. Therfore he is iuſtified by Chriſt, who is freely loſed from the gilt &amp; iudgment of eternal death, to which he was ſubiect. This is the righteouſnes of faith, whiles that God counteth vs iuſt, by not imputing our ſins. This only proprietie of the word is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to refute the cauils of the Papiſts, who hold that we are not iuſtified by pardon or by free accepting, but by habit and infuſed righteouſnes?
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:7788:168" rendition="simple:additions"/> Therfore let vs not ſuffer them to rent in peeces vnworthely &amp; wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this text of Paule, when he ſaith that we are iuſtified from all things, that we may be aſſured of remiſſion of ſins. And now we muſt know that the law of Moſes is ſet againſt Chriſt, as the principal meane to obtaine righteouſnes, if there had bin any beſids Chriſt, Paul diſputeth in deed of ceremonies: but we muſt note that there was nothing omitted in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which might ſerue to purge ſins &amp; to appeaſe god. Yet there was not one of al the ceremonies of the law, which did not make man gilty, as a new handwriting: as Paul teacheth Col. 2. What then? Aſſuredly God meant to teſtifie, that men are iuſtified by the death of his ſon alone,<note place="margin">Col. 2.14.</note> becauſe he made him ſin for vs, who did no ſin, that we might haue righteouſnes in in him. 2. Cor. 5. Wherupon it foloweth that whatſoeuer ſatiſfactions are inuented by men, they tend to rob Chriſt of his honor. <hi>In the Law</hi> and in <hi>Christ,</hi> ſignifie as much as by the Lawe and by Chriſt, according to the Hebrew phraſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>From all things.</hi> By this member is refuted the wicked inuention of the Papiſts, who teach that only original ſin, and actuall ſins committed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore baptiſm are clearely &amp; freely forgiuen by Chriſt, and that other are redeemed by ſatiſfactions. But Paul ſaith plainly that we are iuſtified fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſins by Chriſt throughout the whole courſe of our life. For we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that the ceremonies of the Law were commited to the Iewes, that as wel the profit as the vſe thereof might floriſh daily in the church, that is that the Iewes might in deed vnderſtand, that their ſacrifices &amp; waſhings were not continually iterated in vaine. If the truth &amp; ſubſtance of them be found in Chriſt, it followeth that there is no other ſatiſfaction or ſacrifice to put away ſins, but his death, otherwiſe there ſhould be no analogie or proportion betweene this &amp; the old figures. The Papiſts cal vs back vnto repentance and the Keyes: as if the ceremonies of the Law were not exerciſes to think vpon repentance, and as if the power of the Keyes were not annexed vnto them. But the faith of the Godly was hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen by ſuch helps, that they might flie vnto the grace of the Mediatour alone. Therfore let this remaine ſure &amp; certaine, that the righteouſnes which we haue in Chriſt is not for one day or a moment, but it is euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, as the ſacrifice of his death doth daily reconcile vs to God.</p>
               <p n="39">39 <hi>Euerie one that beleeueth.</hi> Paul ſheweth how men obtaine the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes of Chriſt: to wit, when they receiue it by faith, and that which faith doth obtaine, is not obtained by any merits of workes. Wherefore Paul his opinion is plaine, That we are iuſtified by faith alone: which notwithſtanding the Papiſts oppugne and ſtriue againſt no leſſe obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natly than bitterly. Neuertheleſſe it is requiſite that we know what the word <hi>beleue</hi> doth import, which is made vnſauery to the papiſts through ignorance. There be alſo other benefites of Chriſt which we reape by faith. For when he regenerateth vs by his Spirit, he reſtoreth in vs the image of god, &amp; after that the old man is crucified, he faſhioneth vs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to newnes of life. But it was ynough for Luke to expreſſe this one thing, how men returne into fauour with God, from whom they be eſtraunged by ſinne, becauſe we may eaſily paſſe thence vnto the reſidue.</p>

For if the Iewes had bin obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and willing to obey, vndoubtedly he would haue ſought ſweetly to allure them vnto Chriſt. But it was either their ſluggiſhnes or elſe their wilfulneſſe that cauſed him to be more angrie. Like as all thoſe muſt be cited to appeare before Gods iudgement ſeat, who contemne the grace of Chriſt, and the horrible iudgement of eternal death muſt be denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to thoſe.

               <p n="41">41 And yet he doth not recite word for word the words of Abacuk, which go thus, Behold the Gentiles, and ſee and wonder, and be aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied: becauſe a worke ſhall be done in your dayes, which no man ſhall beleeue when it ſhall be told him. Paul ſaith, Behold yee deſpicers, that the Iewes may know that the vengeance which was once brought vpon their fathers, is common to the deſpicers of the worde: as if he ſhould ſay, God doth at this day make no leſſe account of his word, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt whereof he did once puniſh ſo ſharpely. Therefore the Prophet his denunciation doeth appertaine vnto all ages: ſo that the deſpicers cannot hope, that they can eſcape that vengeance now, whereof others haue taſted.

               <p>
                  <hi>A worke in your dayes.</hi> The ſenſe is, Thoſe who refuſe to beleeue the word of God, ſhal feale his hand, that being at length with plagues con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uict, they may know that he ſpake in earneſt.

               <p n="43">43 And that afterward there came certain of the Iewes &amp; proſelytes to Paul, being both deſirous to learne, &amp; alſo that they might make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of their faith. When as the old interpreter &amp; Eraſmus did tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late it <hi>the Sabaoth</hi> following, they did not vnderſtand Luke his meaning. For ſeing that he intreateth in this place of the Gentiles, I do not think that they chooſe a Sabaoth wherein they may heare Paul &amp; Barnabas. For that day was appointed for the Iewes, but the Gentiles had no leſſe opportunitie vpon other daies: therefore to what end ſhould they defer their deſire &amp; praiers vntil the eight day? yea rather they couet to heare Paul whiles he is at leiſure, &amp; is not occupied in teaching the Iewes.

Furthermore whiles that the gentiles do ſnatch gredily at euery firſt opportunity, the Iews being quiet, do neglect that which is ſet before them: ſaue only that certain of them ioyne themſelues to Paul &amp; Barnabas. Luke expreſſeth the proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes by name: who ſeeing they had embraced the doctrine of the Law and did worſhip the God of Iſrael, were not puffed vp with that pride, which hindred the Iewes who made boaſt of their long ſtock and race.</p>
               <p n="43">43 <hi>Who ſpeaking.</hi> The ſenſe is doubtful. For it may be referred vnto the Iewes and Proſelytes, that they exhorted Paul and Barnabas that they ſhould not faint, but ſtand ſtoutly in the grace of God. Neither did
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:7788:170"/> they want occaſion: for they ſawe cumbates prepared for them: &amp; that therefore they had need of inuincible conſtancy to ſuffer and abide the brunts of the contrarie faction. Wherefore that might very well agree, that being enflamed with a deſire to go forward, they ſought to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage Paul and Barnabas to hold on. If you referre it vnto Paul and Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas, the ſenſe ſhalbe this: that they did not reiect thoſe which came, but they intertained them courteouſly and gently, and confirmed and ſtrengthned them, that they might perſiſt in the grace which they had receiued. And this worde <hi>Grace,</hi> doth firſt comprehend the faith of the Goſpel, ſecondly thoſe good things which come thence to vs: or that I may ſpeake more briefely, the calling into the hope of eternall ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

And it is to be doubted whether Luke do mean by the word zeale, that they were moued with a certaine wicked indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, to ſet themſelues againſt Paul and Barnabas: as ambition is the mother as well of enuy as of all contention: or he take zeale for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation conceiued thereupon: becauſe they did lament that the Gentiles were made equall with the people of God.

For though they had ſharply pricked them, yet they did yet ſpare them a little: but now when they ſee Chriſt obſtinatly reiected by them, they excommunicate them and depriue them of the kingdome of God. And by this example are we taught, that wee muſt not vſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme ſeueritie, ſaue onely againſt thoſe who are quite paſt hope. And the more bold the reprobate are to oppreſſe the truth, the more corage ought we to take to our ſelues. For the ſeruants of God muſt be armed with inuincible conſtancie of the Spirit, that they may neuer giue place to the diuell nor to his miniſters: as the Lord commandeth Ieremie to encounter with the reprobate with a face of yron.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It was neceſſarie.</hi> He accuſeth them of vnthankfulnes, becauſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they were choſen by God out of all people, that Chriſt might offer himſelf vnto them, they refuſe ſo great a benefit maliciouſly. And in the former member he ſetteth downe the degree of honor and excellencie wherunto God had exalted them: afterward followeth the vpbraiding, becauſe they do willingly caſt from them ſo great grace: whereupon he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cludeth that it is now time that the goſpel be tranſlated vnto the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles. In that he ſaith that it was meete that it ſhould firſt be preached to them, it doth properly appertaine vnto the time of Chriſt his kingdome. For vnder the Law before Chriſt was giuen, the Iewes were not only the firſt, but alone.<note place="margin">Exo. 19.5.6</note> Therefore was it that Moſes called them a prieſtly king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and the peculiar people of God. But the adoption of God reſted then with them alone vpon this condition (the Gentiles being omitted) that they ſhould be preferred as yet before the gentiles by the comming of Chriſt. For though Chriſt reconciled the world to his father, yet they were former in order, who were already neere vnto god, &amp; of his family. Therefore that was the moſt lawful order,<note place="margin">Actes. 1.8. Rom. 1.16.</note> that the Apoſtles ſhould ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Church firſt of the Iewes, afterward of the Gentiles, as we ſaw in the firſt Chapter and in other places, ſo that the fellowſhip of the Gentiles did not take from the Iewes the right of the firſt begotten, but that they were alwayes the chiefe in the Church of God. In this reſpect Paul ſaieth, that the righteouſneſſe of God is made manifeſt in the Goſpel, firſt to the Iewes than to the Grecians.</p>
               <pb n="324" facs="tcp:7788:171" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>Such greatnes of grace which God vouchſafed to beſtow vppon them, doth exaggerate and encreaſe the greatnes of their ſin, whiles that they reiect that which is ſo mercifully offered vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Therfore he addeth that they giue iudgement of themſelues, that they are vnworthy of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life. For ſeing that the reiecting of the goſpel is the denial of the righ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teouſnes of God, we need no other iudge to condemne the vnbeleeuers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And after that ye reiect.</hi> Paul ſeemeth to reaſon vnfitly. For firſt it was not of neceſſitie that the Iewes ſhould be excluded that the Gentiles might be admitted vnto the hope of ſaluation: ſecondly this was more conuenient, that after the Iewes had imbraced the goſpel, they ſhoulde grant the ſecond place to the Gentiles. And Paul ſpeaketh in like ſort as if they could not grow togither into one body: and as if the Goſpel could not come vnto the Gentiles, vnleſſe it were reiected of the Iewes. And nowe was he not ordained to be the Apoſtle of the Gentiles before he found ſuch ſtubbernes in the Iews? I anſwere that there is great force in the word <hi>we are turned.</hi> For his meaning is that he is now turned away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Iewes, that he may addict &amp; giue ouer himſelf wholy to the Gentiles. If they had remained in their degree, ſuch turning had not followed, but he ſhould haue drawn the gentiles alſo with a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinual courſe, after that the Iewes were receiued into the boſom, &amp; he ſhould haue embraced the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both togither. Now foraſmuch as the Iews turn their backs, &amp; withdraw the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his miniſtery, he cannot look vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; the gentiles both at once. Therefore taking his leaue of them, he is enforced to tranſlate his care vnto the Gentiles. Therefore vnleſſe the Iewes had eſtranged themſelues from the Church, the calling of the gentiles ſhould haue bin ſuch as is by the Prophets deſcribed: In that day ſhall ſeuen ſtrangers take hold of the cloake of a man that is a Iew, &amp; ſhal ſay we wil walk with you, becauſe God is with you. But now the gentiles are called after a new &amp; accidental maner: becauſe when the Iewes were reiected they entred into the emptie poſſeſſion. They ought to haue bin gathered vnto the Iewes, but after that they fel away &amp; were driuen out, they came in their place. So that their death was the life of the ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiles, &amp; the natural bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches being cut off, the wild Oliues were ingraffed into the holy root: vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til god do at length reſtore them alſo vnto life being ingraffed into their former roote, that the Iſrael of God being gathered togither from all quarters may be ſaued.</p>
               <p n="47">47 <hi>As he hath commanded.</hi> The place is taken out of Iſaias, where not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding god doth rather ſpeak vnto his ſon then vnto the Apoſtles. But we muſt note that many thinges which the ſcripture attributeth to Chriſt, do appertain vnto his miniſters: I ſay many things, not al things. For there be certaine titles proper to the perſon of Chriſt, wherewith to adorn the miniſters were wicked ſacrilege. Chriſt is called our righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: becauſe he was the only purging ſacrifice, &amp; hath reconciled the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to vs by his death, &amp; did riſe again afterward, that hauing ouercom death, he might purchaſe for vs eternal life. Therefore the whole ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of our ſaluation is in Chriſts perſon, but inaſmuch as hee wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth by his miniſters, by reſigning to them his office, he doth alſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part with them his titles. Of this ſort is the preaching of the Goſpel.
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:7788:171"/> He alone was appointed by the father to be our teacher: but he hath put in his place Paſtours and Doctors, who ſpeake as it were out of his mouth. So that the authoritie remaineth wholly to him, and he is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe heard in his miniſters. Therfore Paul doth fitly applie vnto himſelfe the teſtimonie of Iſaias, where he intreateth of the preaching of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I haue made thee a light.</hi> It ſhould ſeeme that he ſpeaketh in that place of ſuch a calling of the Gentiles as doth not carry with it the caſting off of the old people. For God doeth rather aſſociate ſtrangers vnto the Iewes who were before of the houſhold. It is but a ſmal matter ſaith he, that thou be my miniſter in teaching Iſrael, becauſe I haue made thee a light to the Gentiles. God doth ſeeme to begin his Church among the children of Abraham, and that done to reach out his hand to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, that they may both make one Church by one conſent of faith. But Paul doeth in ſuch ſort cite the prophecie, as if it could not be fulfilled, vnles the Iewes had bin caſt off. For he ſignifieth that the light of Chriſt was lighted to the gentiles, after that they were caſt into the darknes of death. I anſwere that this cannot be neceſſarily proued out of the text, that Paul doth affirme that the Gentiles could not haue bin illuminate before the light of the Iewes had bin put out. For this may be the ſenſe, Foraſmuch as you haue depriued your ſelues of eternall life, there is no cauſe why ye ſhould thinke that the grace of God is prophaned, if lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing you we take care &amp; charge of the Gentiles. For the Meſſias is not giuen to you alone, but he is appointed to be the ſauiour of al the whole world, as it is written, I haue made thee &amp;c. Although if you weigh the place of the Prophet more throughly, you ſhal find the caſting off of the old people included therein. For God pronounceth that he wil be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and renowmed in the miniſtery of Chriſt, though Iſrael be not ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered togither. Hee addeth afterward by way of expoſition, that the power of Chriſt ſhal not be reſtrained vnto one people only, becauſe his light ſhal ſhed abroad his beames vnto the fartheſt parts of the worlde, vnto ſaluation. It ſeemeth that Paul noteth this occaſion of calling the Gentiles: namely becauſe ſeing he found no matter to exerciſe himſelfe in among the Iewes, he gaue himſelf wholly to the Gentiles. We muſt note this by the way in the words of the Prophet, that ſaluation is put after light, according to that ſaying of Chriſt, This is eternall life, to know thee the true God, &amp;c. For if the knowledge of God alone,<note place="margin">Iohn 17.3.</note> bring to vs ſaluation, it is likewiſe the onely reſurrection from deſtruction of eternal death, for vs to be illuminate into the faith of Chriſt, after that we be deliuered from the darknes of ignorance.</p>
               <p n="48">48 <hi>And when the Gentiles heard.</hi> The matter of the Gentiles ioy was this, when they heard, that they were not called to ſaluation at a ſodain as if this had not bin decreed before by God, but that that is nowe at length fulfilled, which was foretold many yeeres before. For doubleſſe it was no ſmal confirmation of their faith, becauſe ſaluation was promiſed to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the comming of Chriſt, whereby it did alſo come to paſſe, that they did with more earneſt deſire &amp; reuerence embrace the Goſpel. <hi>To
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:7788:172" rendition="simple:additions"/> glorifie</hi> the word of God may be expounded two maner of waies, either that they did co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe that it was true which was prophecied by Iſaias, or that they imbraced the doctrine which was ſet before them, with faith. Aſſuredly there is a full ſubſcription noted our, becauſe they diſpute or doubt no longer ſo ſoone as they ſaw that Paul had gotten the victorie. And ſurelie we do then honor the woord of God as we ought, when wee ſubmit our ſelues obedientlie to it by faith: as it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be more grieuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly blaſphemed then when men refuſe to beleue it. And here we ſee how the Gentiles were not hindered by that ſtubberneſſe which they ſaw in the Iewes, from giuing their name to Chriſt. With like courage muſt we deſpiſe and tread vnderfoot the pride of the wicked, when by their obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacie they ſtudie to ſtop the waie before vs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And they beleued.</hi> This is an expoſition of the member next going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, at leaſt in my iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. For Luke ſheweth what maner glorie they gaue to the woord of God. And here we muſt note the reſtraint whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſaith that they beleued, but not al in general, but thoſe who were ordei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto life. And we need not doubt but that Luk calleth thoſe <hi>tetagme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous,</hi> who were choſen by the free adoption of God. For it is a ridiculous cauil to refer this vnto the affection of thoſe which beleued, as if thoſe receiued the goſpel, whoſe minds were well diſpoſed. For this ordeining muſt be vnderſtood of the eternal counſel of God alone. Neither dooth Luke ſaie that they were ordeined vnto faith, but vnto life: becauſe the Lord doth predeſtinate his vnto the inherita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of eternal life. And this place reacheth that faith dependeth vpon Gods election. And aſſuredly ſeing that al the whole raſe of mankinde is blinde and ſtubborne, thoſe diſeaſes ſticke faſt in our nature vntil they be redreſſed by the grace of the ſpirit, and that redreſſing floweth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the fountain of election alone. For in that of two which heare the ſame doctrine togither, the one ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth himſelfe apt to be taught, the other continueth in his obſtinacie, it is not therefore becauſe they differ by nature: but becauſe God doth lighten the former, and doth not vouchſafe the other the like grace. We are in deed made the children of God by faith: as faith, as touching vs, is the gate and the firſt beginning of ſaluation: but there is a higher re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of God. For he dooth not begin to chooſe vs after that we beleue: but he ſealeth his adoption which was hidden, in our harts, by the gift of faith, that it may be manifeſt and ſure. For if this be proper to the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God alone, to be his diſciples: it foloweth that it doth not apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein vnto al the children of Adam in general. No maruel therefore, if al do not receiue the Goſpel: becauſe though our heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>lie father inuiteth al men vnto the faith by the external voice of man, yet dooth he not cal effectuallie by his ſpirit anie, ſaue thoſe whom he hath determined to ſaue. Now if Gods election wherby he ordeineth vs vnto life be the cauſe of faith and ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, there remaineth nothing for woorthineſſe or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. Therefore let vs holde and mark that which Luke ſaith: That thoſe were ordeined before vnto life, who being ingrafted into the bodie of Chriſt by faith, doo receiue the earneſt and pledge of their adoption in Chriſt. Whence we do alſo gather, what force the preaching of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:7788:172" rendition="simple:additions"/> hath of it ſelfe. For it doth not finde faith in men, ſaue onlie becauſe God doeth cal thoſe inwardlie whom he hath choſen, and becauſe he draweth thoſe who were his owne before, vnto Chriſt.<note place="margin">Iohn. 6.25. Iohn. 6.37.</note> Alſo Luke tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth in the ſame woords, that it cannot be that anie of the elect ſhould periſh. For he ſaith not that one or a few of the elect did beleeue, but ſo manie as were elect. For though Gods election be vnknowen to vs, vntil we perceiue it by faith: yet is it not doubtful or in ſuſpenſe in his ſecret counſel: becauſe he commendeth all thoſe whom he counteth his to the ſafegard and tuition of his ſon, who will continue a faithfull keeper euen vnto the end. Both members are neceſſarie to be knowne. When Election is placed aboue faith, there is no cauſe why men ſhoulde cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge to themſelues any thing in any part of their ſaluation. For if faith wherein conſiſteth ſaluation, which is vnto vs a witneſſe of the free adoption of God, which coupleth vs to Chriſt, and maketh his life ours, whereby we poſſeſſe God with his righteouſneſſe, &amp; finally where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by wee receiue the grace of ſanctification, be grounded without vs, in the eternal counſell of God: what good thinges ſo euer we haue, we muſt needs acknowledge that we haue receiued it of the grace of God, which doth preuent vs of it owne accorde. Againe becauſe manie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle themſelues in doubtfull and thornie imaginations, whiles that they ſeeke for their ſaluation in the hidden counſel of God, let vs learne that the election of God is therefore approued by faith, that our minds may be turned vnto Chriſt, as vnto the pledge of Election, &amp; that they may ſeeke no other certaintie,<note place="margin">Iohn. 3.3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="49">49 <hi>The word of the Lorde was ſpread abroad.</hi> Luke doth in this place de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the proceeding of the Goſpel. Wherein appeareth how true the parable of Chriſt is, when hee ſaieth that it is like to Leauen. Wee had before that there was greate concourſe of people, ſo that the ſeede of true doctrine was ſowne throughout the whole Citie: Luke ſaieth nowe that it was ſpredde farther: to wit, throughout the whole countrie.</p>
               <p n="50">50 Neuertheleſſe hee declareth that that was done not without great paines and trouble. Therefore the beginning of the calling of the Gentiles was ioyfull and proſperous, neither coulde Satan hinder the courſe of the grace of God: but in the meane ſeaſon, it ſtoode Paul and Barnabas vpon (whom God had brought foorth into the fielde,) to ſtriue. And wee muſt marke what Luke ſayeth, that the religious and honeſt women together with the chiefe menne of the Citie were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to perſecute the ſeruauntes of Chriſt. For this was no ſmall offence to the rude, and thoſe who were as yet ſcarce begotten in Chriſte, when they ſawe all thoſe menne and women whiche were of anye accounte or eſtimation ſette againſt Chriſt, and alſo whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer was prayſe woorthye according to menne. A greate multitude of men receiued Chriſt, but it was but the multitude and the ofſcouringes of menne. Againſt them were ſette the chiefe menne of the Citye,
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:7788:173" rendition="simple:additions"/> who with their pompe did eaſily oppreſſe the baſe and obſcure multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. That might alſo cauſe doctrine to be ſuſpected, yea to be hated, in that godly and honeſt matrons to looke to, were enimies to it. If wicked, vngodly, &amp; miſchieuous men ſhould haue iſſued out of their Tauerns &amp; dens: if companies of whores ſhould breake out of their brothilhouſe, it ſhould be no reproch to the goſpel: yea rather the dignitie therof ſhould thereby appeare more plainely: but nowe what may the weake thinke with themſelues, but that the doctrine which hath ſuch aduerſaries is not of God? Therefore it was expedient that not onely the faithfull who were as yet weake ſhould be confirmed by the Lord, leaſt their faith ſhould faile, but alſo that the hande ſhould be reached out to Paul and Barnabas, leaſt being diſcouraged they ſhould leaue of. And by this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample the lord meant to teach vs, that we muſt valiantly reſiſt ſuch lets, and that we muſt beware leaſt the vaine viſures of vertue do blind our eyes, ſo, that we cannot ſee the glorie of Chriſt which ſhineth in the Goſpel. For it is certaine that all that vertue and honeſtie which is in men, is meere hypocriſie, where they ſet themſelues againſt Chriſt. Though it may be that thoſe who are raſhly carried againſt Chriſt for a time may afterward repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding we muſt thus think with our ſelues, that whatſoeuer faire ſhow of holines thoſe bear, who reſiſt the Goſpel: they are neither indewed with the perfect feare of God, neither are they any thing elſe but a vaine ſhadowe, howe greatly ſoeuer they boaſt of their vertue. Neither is it without cauſe that Chriſt hath this title giuen him,<note place="margin">Luk. 2.35.</note> that hee reuealeth the cogitations of manie hearts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Religious.</hi> And what maner religion could that be, where there was no reuerence of the word of God? We muſt note that there be fower kinds of men: as there be few which worſhip God ſyncerely &amp; from the heart, ſo there be few who openly profeſſe the manifeſt and groſſe contempt of him. Theſe be two ſorts. And the more part is neither quite without religion, neither is it altogither voide of the common worſhip of God: but yet notwithſtanding whiles they do coldly and as it were ouerfields play with God, if they be throughly examined, they be but prophane. Like as at this day the vngodlineſſe of many is after a ſort ſhrowded vnder ceremonies, and the feigned profeſſion of the worſhip of God. So that in all ages there haue bin certaine worſhipers of God who haue worſhiped him like ſtage players, whoſe holines did whollie conſiſt in geſtures and vaine pomps. In Pauls time, euen as at this day, a peculiar ſtudie of godlineſſe was to be found in a fewe: whoſe religion though it were impure, and their heart feigned, deceitful, and double: yet are they counted after a ſort religious in reſpect of their zeale. But hereby appeareth what account we may make of bare religion, which driueth headlong through vnaduiſed heat the profeſſors thereof, to reſiſt the kingdom of god, &amp; to oppreſſe his glory. Furthermore it is to be thought that though theſe matrons had not altogither giuen their name to Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daiſme, neither had they bin nouſled in the doctrin of the Law, yet were they halfe Iewiſſes and that was the cauſe that they did ſo willingly take

Furthermore, he meant by this meanes to declare that God doth ſo deteſt the wicked, that wee muſt take great heed, that we haue no fellowſhip with them: leaſt we be infected with their vncleanneſſe. All the wicked are ſaid in deed to pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute the ground whereon they tread: but the Lord did neuer commande that any ſaue only the conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ners of his word ſhould be ſo reiected with ſuch execration. If any adulterer, or whoremonger, if any periured per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, if any drunkard were to be excommunicate, this ſigne was not vſed. Therefore it appeareth how intollerable the contempt of the worde of God is in his ſight: bicauſe when as he commandeth that the duſt of the feet be ſhaken off, it is as much as if he ſhould pronounce, that they are the bondſlaues of Satan, men paſt hope, and worthie to be baniſhed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the earth. Wherefore let this ſo great ſeueritie teach vs to reuerence the Goſpel. Alſo the miniſters of the word are taught, with howe great feruentneſſe of zeale they muſt maintain the maieſtie of the word, that they do not coldly diſſemble and wink at the contempt thereof.</p>
               <p n="52">52 <hi>The diſciples were filled with ioy.</hi> This member may be expounded two maner of wayes, that they were filled with ioy and the Spirit, by hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pallage thus, with ioy of the Spirit, or (which is al one) with ſpiritual ioy: becauſe there is no quietneſſe, peace, or ioy of conſcience, but it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth of the Spirit of God, in which reſpect Paul ſaith that the kingdom of God is rightuouſneſſe, peace, and ioy in the Spirit,<note place="margin">Rom. 14.17.</note> or that the worde <hi>Spirit,</hi> may containe vnder it other vertues and giftes. Yet this pleaſeth me better, that they were filled with ioy: becauſe the grace of the holie Spirit reigned in them: which alone doth ſo make vs glad truly and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, that we are carried vp aboue all the whole worlde. For wee muſt marke Luke his drift, that the faithfull were ſo farre from being troubled and ſhaken with thoſe ſtumbling blockes, howe great ſoeuer they were, with the reproch of their teachers, with the diſquieting of the citie, with terrors and threatnings, alſo with feare and dangers hanging ouer their heads: that they did with the loftineſſe of their faith deſpiſe valiantlie the gorgeouſneſſe as well of their faigned holineſſe as of their power. And aſſuredly if our faith ſhalbe well grounded in god, &amp; ſhalbe thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie rooted in his worde, and finally if it ſhalbe well fortified with the aide of the Spirite as it ought, it ſhall nouriſh peace and ioy ſpirituall, in our mindes though all the whole world be on an vproare.</p>

               <p n="1">1 <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the chapter laſt going before Luke declared, how Paul and Barnabas took in hand their am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſage vnto the Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiles. Furthermore it might ſeeme to bee an vnproſperous and vnluckie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, in that they were not only expelled out of Antioch, but alſo enforced by the obſtinate wickednes of certaine to ſhake off the duſt from their feet. But though they had but ſhort inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment in one place, yet do they not yeeld: becauſe they conſider that the Lord had called them vpon that condition, that they ſhuld do their dutie thogh the whole world &amp; Satan, did ſay nay. Therfore we ſee that they came not onelie ready to teach, but alſo armed to enter conflictes, that they might couragiouſly proceede in publiſhing the Goſpel, euen through the midſt of cumbats. And aſſuredly that which was once ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to Ieremie, is common to all the prophetes and miniſters of God, they ſhall fight againſt thee,<note place="margin">Ier. 1.19.</note> but they ſhall not preuaile. Now whither ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer they flie, they carry with them the ſame courage ſtill: wherby it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth that they were not only furniſhed for one combat, but euen for continuall warfare: which Luke doth now proſecute. He ſaieth firſt, that they came to Iconium, and there withall hee ſheweth that they ſought not there ſome hauen, where they might reſt quietly: but they entered the Synagogue, as if they had ſuffred no hurt at all. I refer the word <hi>Cata to auto,</hi> for aſmuch as it ſignifieth amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the Grecians together, or at the ſame time rather vnto the Iewes than vnto Paul &amp; Barnabas. Therfore I interpret it thus, not that they went in both together, but that they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the multitude at the ſolemne and appointed time of the meeting, whence wee gather that they ſpake not ſecretly with a few men, but in a great aſſembly of people: wherby they declare their boldneſſe and redie deſire, they are ſo far from fearing enuie, or auoiding danger.</p>
               <pb n="331" facs="tcp:7788:174"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>That a great multitude beleeued.</hi> As Luke did before ſhewe the power of the Spirit in Paul &amp; Barnabas: ſo now he commendeth another grace of God in that proſperous ſucceſſe which they had, for one onely ſermon which they made, was not without frute, but it brought forth many chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of god: as wel of the Iewes as of the Gentiles. If one, or two, or a few, had beleeued they might haue thoght that they ſped wel, but the Lorde co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> far better, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as they gather ſuch plentiful frute of their doctrin euen in a ſhort time. For they knew that ſo many hearts of men were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerted to beleeue, not ſo much by their voice, as by the power of the Spirit: whereby they might alſo aſſure themſelues, that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues were defended by the outſtretched hand of God: which did not a little in courage them.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>And thoſe Iewes which beleeued not.</hi> Lo, they are perſecuted now afreſh, &amp; that by the Iewes. For they were like firebrands to inflame the minds of the Gentiles, For it is to be thought that the Gentiles could abide to heare the goſpel preached, vnles they had bin incenſed to reſiſt by theſe fannes. I interprete <hi>cacoſai</hi> in this place, for to reſiſt with a malicious af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, or to enforce to do hurt, Vnder the name Brethren, Luke com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth in my iudgement all the godly: to wit, that they were vexed and troubled whoſoeuer imbraced the goſpel, as if ſome pernicious ſect had riſen to ſpread diſcord, to trouble the peace of the citie, to ſhake the publike ſtate. Yet if any had rather reſtraine it vnto Paul and Barnabas, I am not greatly againſt him.</p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>A long time.</hi> Luke declareth here, that Paul &amp; Barnabas did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part the citie, ſo ſoone as they ſaw ſome ſet againſt them. For when hee ſaith, that they behaued themſelues boldly, he giueth vs an inckling that there was cauſe of feare offered them. Whence wee gather that they ſtood ſtoutly, &amp; that through rare conſtancie &amp; courage they counted al dangers as nothing, vntill they wer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pelled by violence to depart to an other place. This clauſe <hi>Epi curio</hi> may be expounded diuerſly, either that they behaued themſelues ſtoutly in the Lords cauſe: or that they truſted to his grace, &amp; were therby encouraged. I haue folowed that which was more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men, that they behaued themſelues freely &amp; boldly in the Lord, that is, being holpen not by their own ſtrength, but by his grace. He ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth immediatly after, after what ſort they were incoraged in the Lord: to wit, becauſe he approueth the doctrine by ſignes &amp; myracles. For ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they knew therby, that the Lord was preſent with them, &amp; that his hand was nigh to help them, they were worthilie pricked forward to behaue themſelues ſtoutly. But in noting one kind, he doth not exclude other kinds. For the Lorde did lift them vppe vnto boldnes, &amp; eſtabliſh them in conſtancy by other means. But it ſeemeth that Luke did ſpeake of myracles expreſly, becauſe the Lord ſhewed in them his power open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before all the people. Therfore Paul &amp; Barnabas were not a little im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldened, when the Lord did ſo deliuer their doctrine from contempt. Furthermore, we muſt note this phraſe, that the Lord gaue witnes to the goſpel in myracles, for it ſheweth the true vſe of miracles. This is indeed the firſt end, that they may ſhew to vs the power and grace of God: but
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:7788:175"/> becauſe we be wrong &amp; peruers interpreters of them, leaſt they be dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen vnto abuſe and corruption, God doth neuer ſuffer them to be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from his worde. For if myracles were wrought at any time with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his worde, firſt that was very ſeldome: ſecondly there came but ſmal fruite therof. And God hath wrought myracles for the moſt part, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the worlde might know him not ſimply or in his bare maieſtie, but in his worde. So Luke ſaith in this place that the Goſpel was eſtabliſhed by myracles, not that ſome confuſed religion might poſſeſſe the mindes of men, but that Paul his doctrine going before, they might be brought vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the pure worſhip of God: whence we may eaſily gather, how fooliſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Papiſts deale, when as they indeuour to lead away the world from the reuerence of God and the goſpel by bare myracles. For wee muſt hold that principle, that thoſe myracles which came from God at anye time did neuer tend to any other end, but that the goſpel might haue his perfect and full authoritie.</p>
               <p>Now muſt we ſee whether the Goſpel commaund vs to call vpon the dead: to burne incenſe to idols: to tranſlate vnto fained Saints the grace of Chriſt: to take in hand vowed pilgrimages: to inuent profane worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings, wherof there is no mention made in the word of God. But there is nothing more contrary to the Goſpell, then that theſe ſuperſtitions ſhould take place. Whereupon it followeth that the Papiſts do wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make engines of the ſhoares of the goſpel to oppugne it. To the ſame end tendeth that which Luke ſaith, that the Lord graunted that by the handes of his ſeruants myracles might be done: in which words he tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth that thoſe were only miniſters, who obeyed God: and that he was the authour, who vſed their hand and induſtrie. Wherefore in ſpeaking properly we cannot ſay that they were Paul and Barnabas his myracles: but the myracles of God alone, who doth ſo worke by men, that hee will not haue his glory darkened by their miniſterie. Furthermore, wee muſt note the title of the Goſpell, which Luke putteth in here, that it may be made to vs more amiable. For in calling it the worde of grace, it hath a moſt pleaſant taſt: becauſe ſaluation is offered to the world in it through Chriſt, and we muſt vnderſtand the contrarietie with the law, wherein only the curſe is ſet before vs. Therfore let vs remember that God ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to vs in the Goſpel to this end, that he may reconcile himſelf to vs, and may teſtifie that he is mercifull to vs. Neither doth this hinder that it is the ſauour of death vnto death to the reprobate: becauſe they chaunge not the nature thereof by their fault. Reade thoſe thinges which we haue ſpoken in the ſecond Chapter touching ſignes and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.<note place="margin">2. Cor. 2.16</note>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4 <hi>The multitude was diuided.</hi> The moſt troubleſome part of the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedie followeth now, for the citie is diuided into two partes: &amp; at length Paul and Barnabas (being enforced by the vprore of the people) depart vnto an other place. If it be demanded what was the originall of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde, aſſuredly it flowed from the Goſpell: to which notwithſtanding there is nothing more contrary then to cauſe diſcord. But the froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of men cauſeth that the goſpel which ought to be the bond of vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:7788:175"/> is, (ſo ſoone as it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth abroad) the occaſion of tumults. Wherfore ſo ſoone as any ſciſme ariſeth before we condemne thoſe who ſeeme to be the authours, it behoueth vs wiſely to conſider who ought to bear the blame. Wee heare heere that one citie was diuided, whereby ſome were brought vnto Chriſt. The Spirit of God pronounceth this to the praiſe, and not to the ſhame of Paul and Barnabas. The ſame rule muſt we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue at this day, leaſt the Goſpell bee burdened with falſe enuie, if it bring not men together vnto God, but the wicked rage againſt it. It is aſſuredly a miſerable matter to ſee diuiſion among men. But as the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is accurſed which doth ſeparate vs all from God: ſo it were better that a few ſhould depart an hundred times from all the whole worlde, and in the meane ſeaſon come in fauour againe with GOD, then that diſagreeing with him continually, they ſhoulde haue peace with the worlde.</p>

                     <hi>9</hi> When they knewe the matter, they fled into cities of Lycaonia, to Lyſtra and Derbe, &amp; to the countrie lying nigh there about on euery ſide:</p>

                     <hi>7</hi> And there they preached the Goſpel:</p>

               </q>
               <p n="5">5 Marke how far foorth the holy cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pions of Chriſt did ſuffer. They giue not backe when their enemies doe only ſet themſelues againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but when the ſedition waxeth whot, and they be in danger of ſtoning: though they haue many fauourers of their doctrine, they go no further: but remembring the ſaying of Chriſt, wherein he warneth the faithfull in patience to poſſeſſe their ſoules, they auoide the furie of the enemie. And though they flie-leaſt they throw themſelues headlong into death: yet their conſtancie in preaching the goſpel, doeth ſufficiently declare that they feared not danger. For Luke ſaith that they preached the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel in other places alſo. This is the right kinde of feare when the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants of Chriſt do not runne wilfully into the hands of their enemies, of them to be murthered, and yet they doe not forſlow their dutie: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth feare hinder them from obeying God when he calleth: and ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequently they can afoord if need be to go euen through death it ſelf to doe their dutie.</p>
               <p n="8">8 <hi>A certaine man at Lyſtra.</hi> Luke teciteth one myracle, which wee may thinke was one of manie: but there was mention made of it alone by reaſon of the famous euent. For wee ſhall ſee by and by what hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened. Luke reckoneth vp the circumſtances, which doe more plainelie ſet foorth the power of God, when he ſaith that the man did neuer walk,
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:7788:176"/> and that he was a creeple euen from his mothers wombe, and that hee was ſodainly healed by the voice of Paule alone, before the eyes of all men, and that his legs which were dead were made nimble, ſo that hee leapt vp whithout making any ſtop.</p>
               <p n="9">9 <hi>He heard Paul ſpeake.</hi> Hearing is ſet down firſt, that we may know that the faith which Luke will commend by and by, was conceiued of Paul his doctrine. Therefore when he heard Paul, he hoped to bee hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. But the queſtion is, whether this was promiſed to him ſpecially: for God doth not commaund vs to hope for euery thing by and by, when he offereth vnto vs eternall ſaluation in the Goſpel. I anſwere, that this was a ſingular and extraordinarie motion of the Spirite of God in the cree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as it was on the other ſide in Paul, when he knew his faith by behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him only. It may be that many may receiue the Goſpell: and yet they ſhall not be cured of thoſe diſeaſes wherewith they are vexed. But foraſmuch as God was determined to ſhewe a token of his grace in the creeple, he prepared his mind before, and made him capable of this that ſhould come vpon him. Wherefore wee muſt not make this a common rule, becauſe the creeple beleeued that he ſhould be healed, but it was a peculiar preparation to receiue the gift of healing. And this kind of faith is likewiſe particular, which giueth place to myracles, which many of Gods children do want, who are notwithſtanding indued with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of adoption.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whom when Paul beheld ſtedfaſtly.</hi> Wee know howe doubtfull and how deceitful a thing the countenance of man is, therefore there coulde no ſure iudgement be giuen thereby of faith, which hath God alone to bee witneſſe thereof: but as I haue alredie ſaid, the creeples faith was reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to Paul by the ſecret inſpiration of the Spirit: as he was to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles their only guide and maſter to worke myracles.</p>
               <p n="10">10 <hi>He ſaid with a loud voice.</hi> Many old bookes, and thoſe of great cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite, adde, I ſay to thee in the name of Ieſus Chriſt, &amp; ſurely we ſee how careful the Apoſtles were to magnifie the name of Chriſte in all myra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles: therefore I thinke that that was expreſſed by Luke, and yet we can not finde it commonly now in the printed bookes. Whereas Luke ſaieth afterward that the lame man leapt vp, it ſerueth not only for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of gods power: but alſo ſuch readineſſe and willingneſſe to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey, did teſtifie that he was rightly prepared by the Lord: ſo that hee did alreadie walk in mind, when as his feete were as yet dead. Although his ſpeed in riſing made the power of God more manifeſt, to which end alſo Paul exalted his voice, that the ſodaine chaunge might the more moue the multitude.</p>

                  <p n="11">
                     <hi>11</hi> Furthermore when the multitude had ſeen what Paul had doone, they lifted vp their voice, ſaying in the ſpeech of Lycaonia, Gods being made like to men are come downe to vs.</p>
                  <p n="12">
                     <hi>12</hi> And they called Barnabas Iupiter: and Paul Mercurie, becauſe hee was the captaine of the ſpeech.</p>

                     <hi>13</hi> And Iupiters prieſt, which was before their citie, bringing Bulles &amp; crownes vnto the gates, would haue done ſacrifice with the multitude.</p>

                  <pb n="335" facs="tcp:7788:176"/>11 <hi>Furthermore, the multitude.</hi> This hiſtorie doth abundantly teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie how readie &amp; bent men are vnto vanitie. Paul vttered not that word abruptly, ariſe: but he added it as it wer a concluſion to the ſermon made concerning Chriſt. Yet the people aſcribe the praiſe of the myracle vnto their idols, as if they had heard no word of Chriſt. In deede it is no ſuch wonder, that the barbarous men fell vnto ſuperſtition, whiche they had learned from their childhood, ſo ſoone as they ſaw the myracle. But this vice is too common euery where, &amp; it is ſo bred in vs, to bee peruers and wrong interpreters of the works of god. Hence com ſuch groſſe dotings of ſuperſtitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in poperie, becauſe catching raſhly at myracles, they take no heed to doctrine. For which cauſe we muſt take the better heed, &amp; be the more ſober, leaſt wee happen with the ſenſe of the fleſhe to corrupt (wherunto we are ſo bent) the power of god, which ſhineth &amp; appeareth to vs for our ſaluation. And no maruel if the Lord would haue only a few myracles wrought, &amp; that for a ſhort time: leaſt through the luſt of men they ſhould be drawne vnto a far contrary end: becauſe it is vnmeet that he ſhould ſet his name to be mocked of the world: which muſt needes be, when that which is proper to him is tranſlated vnto Idols, or the vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers corrupt his works, to inuent corrupt worſhipping: while that ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the word aſide, they catch at euery diuine power which they feigne.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gods like to men.</hi> This was an opinion drawne from old fables, which notwithſtanding tooke the beginning of truth. The bookes of the poets are full of theſe toyes, that the gods were often ſeen vppon earth in the likenes of men: and yet we may well think that this came not of nothing: but rather that profane men did turn that into fables, which the holy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers taught in times paſt concerning angels. And it may be that Satan, when he had men beſotted, did with diuers iuglings, delude the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. This is of a truth, whatſoeuer was gods, whenſoeuer it went with the infidels; it was corrupt by their wicked inuentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. The ſame muſt we likewiſe think of ſacrifices, wherin God did exerciſe his euen from the beginning, that they might haue externall ſignes of godlines &amp; of the worſhip of God. And after that the vnbeleeuers inuented to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues ſtrange gods, they abuſed the ſacrifices vnto their ſacrilegious worſhip. When the men of Lycaonia ſee vnwonted power in the creeple that was healed, they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade themſelues that it is a work of god: this is all wel. But it was euill done, in that they forge to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues falſe gods in Paul &amp; Barnabas, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the old error. For what is the cauſe that they prefer Barnabas before Paul, ſaue only becauſe they folow the childiſh ſurmiſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning Mercurie the interpreter of the gods, in which they had byn nouriſhed. By which exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple we are taught what a miſchief it is to be accuſtomed &amp; acquainted with errors in youth: which can ſo hardly be rooted out of the mind, that euen through the workes of God, whereby they ought to haue been redreſſed, they waxe more hard.</p>

The world is in deed of it ſelfe inclined to this: but then came the ſacrificing prieſtes, who are like fannes &amp; bellowes. And it is not to be douted, but that the whole multitude was moued with ambition, to be ſo deſirous to offer ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to Paul vnder the name of Iupiter, that their citie might bee the more famous and noble. Hence hath Satan ſo great libertie to deceiue, whiles that the ſacrificing prieſtes ſet nets to get gaine, and the people are delighted to haue errors confirmed.</p>

               </q>
               <p n="14">14 <hi>When the Apostles had heard.</hi> In that Paul and Barnabas rent their garments and leap into the midſt of the multitude, it appeareth thereby howe zealous they were for the glorie of God: beeing content onlie to ſpeak to the people, they trobled the preparatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſacrifice ſo much as they are able. It commeth to paſſe ſomtimes that euen hypocrites re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe exceſſiue honor: but they rather prouoke the ſimple to giue it them, with their feigned modeſtie. There was no ſuch thing in Paul and Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas. For they declared both by wordes and alſo by all geſture of body, that they were ſo farre from taking pleaſure in that worſhip which the men of Lyſtra gaue vnto them, that they did vtterly deteſt it. This is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anger, wherewith the ſeruantes of God muſt be inflamed, ſo often as they ſee his glory profaned and ouerthrowen by the ſacrileges of men. And aſſuredly no man ſhalbe able otherwiſe to ſerue God ſincerely and faithfully, vnleſſe he put on that affection of ielouſie, whereof Paul ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in the ſecond Epiſtle to the Corinthians,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 11.2.</note> that thoſe men to whom the Lord hath committed the charge of his church be no leſſe couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and ſtout to defend the glory of their Lord, then a husband is vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant to defend his wiues chaſtitie. Therefore we muſt take good heede, that we ſuffer not that honour to be giuen vs, which may darke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of God: but rather ſo ſone as there appeareth any profaning of gods glory, let this heat breake out, wherof we haue an example in Paul and Barnabas. And though the teachers of the church ought eſpecially to be indued with this zeale, yet there is no one of the godly, which ought
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:7788:177"/> not to be ſore diſpleaſed, when he ſeeth the worſhip of God polluted, or giuen to ſome other: becauſe it is written of all, The zeale of thine houſe hath eaten me vp, and the rebukes of them that rebuked thee fell on me.<note place="margin">Pſal. 69.10.</note> And if ſo be it holy men being yet compaſſed about with the fleſh did ſo greatly deteſt idolatrie, how ſhall we think the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be affected now, when they are ſtripped out of all the affections of the fleſh? Whenas the world abuſeth their names and perſons vnto ſuperſtition, it thinketh it doeth them a great pleaſure: but it is greatly deceiued. For they will ſtande vp firſt againſt their worſhippers, and will in deed declare that they neuer make more account of any thing, then that the worſhip of God might remaine whole and ſound to him. Moreouer, there can bee no greater iniurie done to them, then when the honor which is taken from God is giuen to them: which muſt needes be when any diuine thing is aſcribed and giuen them. Whereas Luke ſaith, that Paul and Barnabas did rent their garments, it appeareth by other places of ſcripture, that this rite &amp; cuſtome was vſed among the men of the Eaſt countrie, ſo often as they would by externall geſture expreſſe either great ſorrow, or deteſting of any thing. When Luke calleth Barnabas an apoſtle together with Paul, he extendeth the ſignification of the word farther then vnto the chiefe order which Chriſt appointed in his Church: like as Paul maketh An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dronicus and Iunias excellent among the Apoſtles. But if wee ſhoulde ſpeake properly they were Euangeliſtes and not Apoſtles: vnleſſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture becauſe Barnabas was made Paul his fellowe in office, wee place them both in like degree of office, ſo may hee be truly called an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle.</p>
               <p n="15">15 <hi>Men why doe yee thoſe things.</hi> They begin with a reprehenſion, as the matter did require: that done, they ſhew to what end they were ſent. Afterward they preach concerning the only God, and ſhew that he was vnknowen to the world. Laſtly, that they may more ſtrongly pluck out of their hearts the deceites and ſleights of the Diuell, they teach that this ignoraunce was without excuſe. Therefore the firſt part of the ſermon is a reprehenſion, wherein the men of Lyſtra are condemned, for wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping mortall men prepoſterouſly in ſteed of God. Though the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon which they alleage ſeemeth to be colde. For it were an eaſie matter to gather thence, that it is not vnlawfull to worſhip thoſe who are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> humane miſeries by death. By this meanes al the ſuperſtitions of the Gentiles ſhould ſtand vntouched which wer wont to count none gods but thoſe who were dead. With the ſame colour alſo haue the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts colored their idolatrie, who worſhip rather the dead mens bones, ſtones and wood, then liuing men in whoſe noſe thrilles is breath. I aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere that Paul and Barnabas drewe this argument from the matter which was now in hand, We be miſerable men: therefore you do falſly and filthily imagine vs to be Gods, &amp; worſhip vs as gods. If idolatrie bee handled generally, this ſhalbe a perpetual reaſon to condemne it, &amp; ſhall alone bee ſufficient enough, that the perfect and whole worſhip of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines is due to god alone, &amp; that therefore it is profaned, ſo ſoone as it is in any point giuen to creatures, whether they be angels, or men, or ſtars.
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:7788:178"/> But occaſion ſhall oftentimes be offered, that many things may bee ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken againſt one kind of Idolatrie, which do not appertaine vnto another neither are agreeable to the ſame: and yet ſhall they bee of no ſmall force for the matter which is in hand, as Paul and Barnabas, by confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that they be mortall men, ſubiect to diuers calamities, had a fit rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to reproue the furie and madneſſe of the people.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We preach to you.</hi> An argument drawen from contraries. For heere they ſhew that the end of their comming was quite contrary: to wit, that they might remoue ſuperſtitions, which had hitherto reigned. For it is all one as if they had ſaid, Doth the myracle moue you? Then giue cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to our wordes. And the ſumme of our ambaſſage is, that al feined Godheads, wherewith the world hath hitherto been deceiued, may be done away &amp; periſh. And this is a general doctrine, wherby they do not only appeaſe the preſent madnes, but alſo reprehend all maner ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and whatſoeuer was contrary to, or diſagreeing with the rule of godlineſſe. For without doubt they call all that vaine which men haue inuented to themſelues of their owne brain, And we muſt mark this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition, that all religion is vaine, which departeth and degenerateth from the pure and ſimple worde of God. There is no expreſſe mention made in deed of the worde, becauſe they ſpake to the Gentiles. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God is no otherwiſe rightly worſhipped, then according to his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, it followeth out of Paul his words, that ſo ſone as me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> depart from that worſhip which God hath commaunded and doth allow, they are wearied fooliſhly and vainely, with a vaine and vnprofitable labour. For that religion wherin God hath not the preheminence is nothing worth, nether hath it any truth or ſoundnes. And this was the cauſe, that ſincere and perfect godlines was neuer found, neither did it euer flooriſh in the more part of the world. For they ſtood only about the remouing of the old Idolatrie: and the other thing was in the meane ſeaſon fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlowed, to bring men vnto the true God alone, after that they had forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Idols. They turned in deed the name of an Idol ſometimes, into the name of God: but vnder that colour they did neuertheleſſe cheriſh the old errors, which they ſhould haue indeuoured to redreſſe. So the prieſts of Fraunce begat the ſingle life of great Cybele. Nunnes came in place of the veſtall virgins. The church of al Saints ſucceeded Pantheo, or the church of all Gods: againſt ceremonies were ſet Ceremonies not much vnlike. At length came in the multitude of gods, who they thought wold be lawfull and tollerable if they had once decked them with the titles of Saints. Corruptions are not by this meanes purged, neither are the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles both profane and ful of filth turned into the temple of God: but the name of God is mixed with profane polluſions, and God himſelfe is brought into a filthie ſtall. Wherefore let vs remember that the apoſtles did not only employ themſelues to ouerthrow Idolatrie which had long time reigned in former ages: but did alſo take great heed that pure reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion might reigne afterward, hauing put all corruptions to flight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Who hath made heauen and earth.</hi> We know that the order of teaching doth require that we begin with things which are better knowen. Seing
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:7788:178"/> that Paul and Barnabas ſpake to the Gentiles, they ſhould haue in vain aſſayed to bring them vnto Chriſt. Therefore it was expedient for them to begin with ſom other point, which was not ſo far ſeparate from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe, that after that was confeſſed, they might afterwarde paſſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vnto Chriſt. The minds of the men of Lyſtra wer poſſeſſed with that errour, that there bee more gods then one. Paul &amp; Barnabas ſhew on the contrary, that there is but one Creator of the world. After that, that fei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned number and multitude of the Gods was taken away, there was paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage nowe made vnto the ſecond member, that they might teach what that god was, who was the Creator of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; earth. The caſe ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth otherwiſe at this day betweene vs and the papiſtes, they confeſſe that there is but one God, and they admit the ſcripture. Therefore it remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth that we proue to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of the ſcripture what God is, &amp; after what ſort he wil be worſhipped of men.</p>
               <p n="16">16 <hi>In times paſt.</hi> Becauſe the men of Lyſtra might obiect that that god was vnknowen, hitherto Paul and Barnabas preuent them and ſay, that all men wandered indeed in darkneſſe, and that all mankinde was ſtricken with blindneſſe, but that they denie that any preiudice muſt be made according to the peruers ignorance of the worlde. Theſe were two no ſmall lets for the vnbeleeuers, long antiquitie of time, and the conſent almoſt of all nations. Paul and Barnabas remoue both in this place: If, ſay they, men haue erred many yeeres, &amp; if the world haue wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered without reaſon &amp; iudgement, let not therefore the truth of God when it appeareth bee leſſe precious to you. For ſeeing that it is eternal and is not chaunged, it is an vnmeete thing that the long preſcription of yeeres ſhould be ſet againſt it. They proue that there is no more aide or patronage to be found in the number of men. There is no cauſe (ſay they) why the conſpiracie of all the whol world ſhould keep you fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the right way. Blindneſſe hath got the vpper hande among all people: but god doeth nowe appeare and giue light to you. Therefore your eyes muſte bee open, and you muſte not ſlumber and ſleepe in darkenes, though all people haue beene drowned therein hyther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Their waies.</hi> If hee had onely ſaide that men were deceiued vntill that time through gods ſufferance, we might eaſily gather thereby, that all men can doe nothing els but erre, ſo long as they be not gouerned of god. Yet hee ſpeaketh far more plainely, when hee calleth errours the wayes of men. For we are plainely taught by this, what the wiſdome and vnderſtanding of mans mind can doe in beholding and keeping the way of ſaluation. All people (ſaith he) haue walked in their owne wayes, that is, they haue wandered in darkneſſe and death: it is all one as if hee ſhoulde ſay that there is no ſparkle of true reaſon in all the whole world.</p>
               <p>Therfore there is but one rule of true godlines, that is, that the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, caſting fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al confidence in their own wit, do ſubmit the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to god. For the waies of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are now, as thei wer in times paſt: &amp; the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:7788:179"/> of all times teach how miſerablie blind thoſe men be, who haue not the worde of God to giue them light, though they thinke they can paſſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men in quickneſſe of ſight. Immediately after the Beginning of the world, the more part fell away vnto diuers ſuperſtitions and wicked wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippings: whence came that? Saue only becauſe it pleaſed them to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their own imaginations? Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it might haue ſeemed that the world was purged with the flood, it fell againe ſtreightway to the ſame vices. Therefore there is nothing more deadly then to leane to our owne wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. But Paul and Barnabas ſhew no cauſe here why the Lord ſuffred the worlde to erre ſo long: and aſſuredly wee muſt count the will of god alone, the chiefeſt law of equity. God hath alwaies a good reaſon for his workes: but becauſe it is oftentimes hid from vs, it is our dutie reuerent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to wonder at his ſecrete counſell: wee muſt in deed confeſſe, that the world was worthie of ſuch deſtruction: but there can no other reaſon be brought why the Lord had mercy rather on one age then on another, ſaue only becauſe it ſeemed good to him that it ſhould bee ſo. Therefore Paul calleth that time which was appointed of God for preaching the goſpel,<note place="margin">Gal. 4.4.</note> the time of fulnes, leaſt any other opportunitie be ſought And we muſt remember that which we had in the firſt chapter, that it is not for vs to know the times &amp; ſeaſons, which the father hath placed in his own power. So that the cauill of the papiſtes is refuted, who ſay that it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be that God ſuffered his church to erre ſo long. For whence I pray you came the Gentiles but from the Ark of Noe, when there was a certaine ſingular puritie of the church? Alſo the poſteritie of holy Sem together with others did degenerate. Yea Iſrael the peculiar people of the Lorde was alſo left for a long time.<note place="margin">Gen. 9.9.</note> Wherfore it is no maruel, if God did puniſh the contempt of his word with the ſame blindneſſe vnder the reigne of his ſonne, as he did in times paſt.</p>
               <p n="17">17 <hi>Notwithſtanding he did not ſuffer himſelf to be without witnes.</hi> Paul and Barnabas take from the Gentiles in this place the cloake of ignorance. For how greatly ſoeuer men pleaſe themſelues in their own inuentions, beeing at length conuict of error, they flie vnto this fortreſſe, that they ought to beare no blame: but that God was rather cruel, who did not vouchſafe ſo much as with one hiſſe to call thoſe back whom he ſaw pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh. Paul &amp; Barnabas cut off this friuolous obiection when they ſhewe that God lay hid in ſuch ſort, that he bare witneſſe of himſelfe and his diuinitie. Notwithſtanding wee muſt ſee how theſe two things can hang together: for if God bare witneſſe of himſelfe, he did not ſuffer (ſo much as in him lay) the worlde to erre. I anſwere, that this kinde of teſtimony wherof mention is made, was ſuch, as that it made men without excuſe, and yet was it not ſufficient to ſaluation. For that of the apoſtle is true, that by faith it is vnderſtood that the worlds were ordeined by the word of God,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.3.</note> but faith is not conceiued by the bare beholding of the heauen and earth, but by the hearing of the worde. Whereuppon it followeth that men are brought by the direction of the woorde alone vnto that knowledge of Almightie GOD which bringeth ſaluation. And yet this letteth not but that they may bee made without excuſe, euen
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:7788:179"/> without the worde, who though they be naturally depriued of light, are blinde notwithſtanding through their owne malice, as Paul teacheth in the firſt chapter to the Romanes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Giuing raine and fruitfull ſeaſons.</hi> God hath indeed reuealed himſelf to all mankind by his word ſince the beginning. But Paul &amp; Barnabas ſhew that there was no age, on which God did not beſtowe benefites, which might teſtifie, that the world is gouerned by his gouernment, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement: and becauſe the light of doctrin had byn buried long time, therfore they ſay only, that God was ſhewed by natural arguments. And it is to be thought, that they did in ſuch ſort ſet foorth the magnificence &amp; greatnes of the works of God as became them: but it was ſufficient for Luke to touch the ſummes &amp; chief points of matters. Neither do I ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it that they intreated ſubtilly and after the manner of the phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers of the ſecrets of nature, for they ſpake vnto an vnlearned mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude: therefore it behoued them to ſet that before them plainly, which the moſt ignorant did know. Notwithſtanding they take this principle, that in the order of nature there is a certaine and euident manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of god: in that the earth is watered with raine, in that the heat of the Sun doth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort it, in that there co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth ſuch abundance of fruit out of the ſame yeerely, it is thereby gathered for a ſuretie that there is ſome God who gouerneth all things. For euen the heauen and earth are not moued or gouerned by their own motion: &amp; much leſſe by fortune. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it remaineth, that this wonderful workmanſhip of nature doth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly ſhew the prouidence of God: and thoſe who ſaid that the worlde was eternal, ſpake not as they thought, but they went about by malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and barbarous vnthankfulneſſe to ſuppreſſe the glory of god: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they bewrayed their impudencie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Filling with meat and gladneſſe.</hi> The vngodlineſſe of men is more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uict in that, if they knew not God, becauſe hee doeth not only ſet before their eyes, teſtimonies of his glory in his workes: but doth alſo appoint all things for their vſe. For why doth the Sun &amp; ſtarres ſhine in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens, ſaue only that they may ſerue men? Why doth the raine fall from heauen? Why doth the earth bring foorth her increaſe, ſaue onely that they may miniſter food to men? Therefore God hath not ſet man vpon earth, that he may be an idle beholder of his workes as being ſet vpon a Theater, but to exerciſe himſelf in praiſing the liberalitie of God, whiles that he enioyeth the riches of heauen &amp; earth. And now, is it not more than filthie frowardneſſe, not to be moued with ſo great goodnes of god in the manifold abundance of thinges? To fill the hearts with meat doth ſignifie nothing els but to giue foode, which may ſatisfie the deſires of men. By this word <hi>gladnes</hi> Paul and Barnabas do meane that God doth giue more to men according to his infinite goodneſſe, then their neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie doth require: as if it had been ſaide, that men haue meate giuen them not only to refreſh their ſtrength, but alſo to make their harts me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. If any man do obiect that it falleth out ſo oftentimes, that men doe rather mourne being hungrie, then reioyce beeing full. I aunſwere, that that commeth to paſſe contrarie to the order of nature: namely, when
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:7788:180"/> the Lorde ſhutteth his hand becauſe of the ſinnes of men. For the libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie of God ſhould flow vnto vs abundantly of his owne accorde, as it is heere deſcribed by Paul and Barnabas, vnleſſe it were kept backe by the lets of our vices. And yet there wes neuer ſo great barrennes, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the bleſſing of God in feeding men did quite wither away. It was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed well ſaid of the Prophet, Open thy mouth, and I will fill it, that wee may know that we be hungrie through our owne fault,<note place="margin">Pſal. 81.11.</note> whiles that wee doe not admit the goodnes of God. But how vnworthie ſoeuer we be &amp; ſtreight, yet the fatherly loue of God breaketh through euen vnto the vnworthie. Eſpecially the generalitie of mankinde doth teſtifie that the benefites of God doe neuer ceaſe, wherein he appeareth to be our father.</p>
               <p n="18">18 <hi>When they had ſaid thus.</hi> Luke ſaid before that they did not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vſe wordes, but they ran alſo with violence into the multitude. Nowe hee addeth that the furie of the people was ſcarſe appeaſed with that vehemencie, whereby appeareth howe mad &amp; vntamed the heat of the world is towarde Idolatrie. For if they beleeue the gods, why doe they not beleeue their worde, whereby they put from them falſe honour? But all idolaters are ſicke of this diſeaſe, that they are oftentimes readie to ſhake off the yoke, vnleſſe religion bee ſubiect to their will and pleaſure. Wherefore no maruel if the prophets ſay oftentimes, that men are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into the blinde affection of ſuperſtitions, euen as brute beaſtes are carried into their luſt.</p>

               <p n="19">19 <hi>There came.</hi> Paul and Barnabas can hardly ſtay the people from doing ſacrifice: but a companie of knaues doe with ſmall adoe perſwade them to ſtone Paul whom of late they made a God. Wherby appeareth how much more men be bent vnto ſuperſtition, then vnto the true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, &amp; how arrogant ſuperſtition is, which will alwaies beare the chief ſway in appointing the worſhip of god. The ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of god ſeek no other thing, but to bring men vnder obedience of him, which is ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and felicitie alone. They challenge to themſelues no Lordſhip, they hunt after no gaine: and yet the world cannot abide them. For almoſte all men murmure: and now and then there riſe tumults. Thoſe who are thus ſtubborn againſt God, they be too to readie to beleeue ſeducers, &amp;
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:7788:180"/> willingly ſubmit themſelues to their tyrannie. So the Pope had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie to deceiue at his pleaſure, and not onely to oppreſſe miſerable ſoules with ſlauerie, but alſo cruelly to torment them. Whatſoeuer hee commaunded it was obediently receiued, and euen at this day, though he make vnpoſſible lawes, yet dare no man once mutter againſt them. Neuertheleſſe the yoke of Chriſt is ſweet,<note place="margin">Mat. 11.30.</note> and yet few there be who will ſuffer it.</p>
               <p>Therefore in this hiſtorie is moſt liuely painted out vnto vs the fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſſe of the worlde. Paule might haue reigned vnder the title of Mercurie, with the commendation of all men: he will not be a God. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſerueth Chriſte faithfully, he is ſtoned. His conſtancie is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, to the end we may follow it. He was in deed wonderfully deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered by the Lorde:<note place="margin">2. Cor. 11.25.</note> but as touching himſelf he ſuffered a moſt cruell kinde of death. Therefore we muſt make like account of this teſtimony, which he doth alſo recite in the ſecond Epiſtle to the Corinthians, as if he had been ſlaine. Furthermore, we need not doubt but that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſort made inſurrection againſt him outragiouſly. So that what vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence ſoeuer the wicked doe to the ſeruants of Chriſt, it is neuer called in queſtion: the lawes are whiſt, iudgements ceaſe: the magiſtrate is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleepe: there is no patron to be found.</p>
               <p n="20">20 <hi>As the diſciples.</hi> Though no man defended Paul, yet Luke ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that the godly were deſirous of his life: yet they did ſo moderate themſelues, leaſt they ſhould attempt any thing with great danger to no end, ſeeing they could not helpe him vnleſſe it were done priuilie. And ſurely we muſt alwayes marke what the Lord hath brought to our hand. If I ſtanding vpon the banke ſhall ſee a man in the middeſt of the water, and cannot reache him my hande when hee is like to be drowned: what is remaining for me to do, but to commende him to the Lorde? And if there bee any hope to help him, then muſt I indanger my ſelfe. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee will not ſay that Saint Paul was left alone by the Diſciples through ſlouth: ſeeyng they coulde not helpe him. And they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare their loue and care, when they ſtande about him after hee is caſt out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They went to Derbe.</hi> It appeareth plainly by this that Paul was mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculouſly ſaued, ſeeing that on the morrowe after hee was caſt out for dead, he taketh his iourney being freſh &amp; ſound, whence it is alſo gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red what an inuincible heart he bare againſt all euils &amp; afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. For he creepeth not into a corner, where like an ouerworn ſouldiar he may liue idlely: but he goeth to the ſame places, where he was vncourteouſly and cruelly handled but a little before. Notwithſtanding Luke ſheweth that the church was firſt planted among the men of Derbe, hee addeth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward that Paul &amp; Barnabas returned vnto the Churches, which they had ordained, that they might confirme the Diſciples, Whereby hee gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs to vnderſtand that the vſe of the worde conſiſteth not in inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction only, whereby the hearer is only taught: but that it is alſo auaile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for confirmation of faith in adomoniſhing, exhorting &amp; reprouing,
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:7788:181"/> And Chriſt doth not only commaund his miniſters to teach, but alſo to exhort:<note place="margin">2. Tim. 3.16</note> and Paul ſaith that the ſcripture is profitable, not only to teach, but alſo to exhort. Wherefore let not Paſtours thinke that they haue done their dutie as they ought, when they haue well trained vp the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in true knowledge, vnleſſe they employ themſelues to this part al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. Againe, let not the faithfull neglect the woorde of God as if the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and preaching thereof were vnneceſſarie: becauſe there is no man who hath not need of continuall confirmation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And exhorting them.</hi> This was the principall way to cofirme, in that they prouoke the diſciples who had before embraced the Goſpel and did profeſſe it, to goe forwarde, by exhorting them. For wee are farre from being ſo readie and ſtout as we ought. Therfore our laſineſſe nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth prickes, and our coldneſſe muſt bee warmed. But becauſe GOD will haue his exerciſed with diuers cumbates, Paul and Barnabas admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhe the diſciples to be readie to ſuffer tribulation. A very neceſſary ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition, that we muſt goe on warrefare in this worlde that wee may liue well and godlilie. If the fleſh ſhould not moleſt vs, if Satan ſhoulde attempt nothing, if the wicked ſhoulde not trouble vs with ſome ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling blocks, it were no ſuch troubleſome thing to perſeuere: becauſe that were a ſweete walke through a ſoft and pleaſant way: but becauſe there ariſe on euery ſide, and euery minute of an houre, infinite aſſaults which prouoke vs to fal away, there ariſeth the hardneſſe, and therfore is it that the vertue of conſtancie is ſo rare. Therefore to the ende wee may perſiſt euen vnto the end, we muſt be prepared for warre. But Luke ſpeaketh not in this place only of the perſecutions which the aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries raiſe againſt vs with drawen ſwordes, and flaming fires: but he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth vnder the worde <hi>tribulations</hi> all ſorrowes &amp; miſeries, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the life of the godly is ſubiect, not becauſe the faithfull alone are miſerable: becauſe this is the common ſtate both of good and badde. Whence alſo commeth that famous prouerbe, It is the beſt, not to bee borne: and the next, to die very quickly. But when as God doth often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſpare the wicked, and doth fat them with ptoſperitie: hee is more ſharpe and harde towarde his children. For beſides common moleſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they are oppreſſed peculiarly with many diſcommodities, and the Lorde doth humble them with ſuch exerciſes, keeping their fleſh vnder correction leaſt it wax wanton: he awaketh them, leaſt they lie ſleeping vpon earth. Vnto theſe are added the reproches and ſlanders of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked: for they muſt be as it were the ofscourings of the world. Their ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenes is laughed at: but they vſe wicked mocks and ſcofs principally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God. Laſt of all, the luſt of the wicked breaketh out into open violence. So that they haue need to ſtriue with manie tribulations, and it cannot bee but that all their life ſhall bee inuied and vnquiet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>middeſt ſo many enemies. But this is the beſt comforte, and which is ſufficient enough to confirme their mindes, that, this way (though it bee harde and ſharpe,) leadeth vnto the kingdome of heauen. For wee gather by this, that the miſeries of the godly are more happie
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:7788:181"/> then be all the doting dainties and delights of the world. Therfore let vs remember, firſt, that rhis condition is ſet downe for vs, that wee ſuffer many tribulations: yet let vs alſo remember to adde this, to mittigate the bitternes thereof, that by them we be brought vnto the kingdome of God. Furthermore their babling is friuolous, who gather hereby that patience is a work which deſerueth eternal ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſeing that the cauſe of ſaluation is not in this place handled: but after what ſort God vſeth to handle his in this world: and the comfort is added, not to extoll the dignitie and merite of workes, but onely to encourage the godly that they faint not vnder the burthen of the croſſe. All mankind as we haue ſaide before, as well one as other, is ſubiect to manie miſeries. But the afflictions of the reprobate are nothing elſe to them but the verie entrie of hell: but theſe turne to the ſaints to an happie and ioyfull end, and for them they fall out well, and ſo conſequently they bee helpes for ſaluation, becauſe they take part with Chriſt. We muſt note that Paule and Barnabas being not content with the plurall number, doe plainely ſet downe Many tribulations, leaſt any man after he hath ſuffered one or two or a few, doe at length ſinke downe. Therefore let the faithfull thinke that they muſt paſſe through continuall miſeries: that done, let them prepare themſelues not for one kind of perſecution onely, but for diuerſe kindes. For though God handle ſome men more courtiouſly and gently: yet doth he pamper none of his ſo daintily, that he is free from all tribulations.</p>

Therefore Chriſt did not onely ſend his Apoſtles to preach the goſpel, but he commanded alſo that there ſhould be Paſtours appointed that the preaching of the Goſpel might be perpetuall and in daily vſe. Paul and Barnabas do marke that this order was ſet downe by Chriſt, when they aſſigned Paſtours to euerie Church, leaſt after their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doctrine ſhould ceaſe and be whiſht. Furthermore this place tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth that the Church cannot want an ordinarie miniſterie: neither can
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:7788:182"/> any be counted chriſtians before God, but thoſe who during their whol life are willing to learne. I take it that thoſe are called Elders in this place, who had the office of teaching inioyned them. For it appeareth by Paul that ſome were onely Cenſors of manners and ſuch as had au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie to puniſh enormities. Now foraſmuch as Luke ſaith, that they were ſet ouer euery Church,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 5.17.</note> the difference betweene their office and the office of the Apoſtles is gathered hence. For the Apoſtles had no certaine place of abode: but they went too and fro to founde newe Churches. But Paſtours were ſet and appointed euerie man to his owne Church, and were as it were placed to watch ouer their Congre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gations.</p>

                  <hi>Had ordained by Election.</hi> The Greeke worde <hi>Cheirotonein</hi> doth ſignifie to decree or ordaine a thing by lifting vp the hands, as they vſe to doe in the aſſemblies of the people. Notwithſtanding the Eccleſiaſticall wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters doe often vſe the word <hi>cheirotonia</hi> in an other ſenſe: to wit, for their ſolemne rite of ordaining, which is called in ſcripture, Laying on of hands. Furthermore by this manner of ſpeech is verie excellently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed the right way to ordaine Paſtours. Paule and Barnabas are ſaide to chooſe Elders. Doe they this alone by their priuate office? nay rather they ſuffer the matter to be decided, by the conſent of them all: therefore in ordaining Paſtours, the people had their free election. But leaſt there ſhould any tumult ariſe Paul and Barnabas ſit as chiefe moderatours. Thus muſt the decree of the Councell of Loadicia bee vnderſtood, which forbiddeth that the people haue libertie graunted them to Elect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They hauing prayed with fasting.</hi> They had a double end and reaſon of their praier: the firſt that, God would direct them with the ſpirit of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and diſcretion, to chooſe the beſt and moſt meete men. For they knewe that they were not furniſhed with ſo great wiſedome, but they might bee deceiued: neither did they ſo much truſt to their diligence, but that they knew that the principall point did conſiſt in the bleſſing of god: as we ſee mens iudgements erre daily, where the heauenly gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not: and that all their labor is nothing worth, where the hande of God is not. Theſe be the true ſignes and tokens of the godly, to call vpon the Spirit of God, that he may gouern their counſels. And if ſo be it this rule be to be obſerued in all buſineſſes: ſo often as the gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church is in hand, which dependeth wholy vpon his will and pleaſure, we muſt beware that we attempt nothing vnleſſe we haue him for our guide and gouernour. And the ſecond end of their prayer was, that God would furniſh with neceſſary giftes thoſe Paſtours which were choſen. For it is a harder matter to fulfill ſuch a function faithfullie as a man ought, than that mans ſtrength is ſufficient for it. Therefore they craue Gods help euen in this part alſo, hauing Paul and Barnabas for their authors. They faſt likewiſe, that euen that may be a helpe to ſtir vp the feruentnes of their praiers. For we know how great our cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes is otherwiſe. Not becauſe it is alwaies neceſſarie that we ſhould pray faſting, ſeing that god doth inuite eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe who are ful to giue thanks:
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:7788:182"/> but when we are vrged by any neceſſitie to pray more feruently than we vſe commonly to doe, this is a verie profitable prouokement. And now we haue alreadie declared what a weightie matter the chooſing of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours is, wherein the ſoundneſſe of the Churche is handled. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no maruell, if Luke write that they vſed extraordinary prayers. And it is profitable for vs to marke this vſe and other of faſting, leaſt we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine with the Papiſts that it is a meritorious worke: or leaſt wee place the worſhip of God in it, ſeing it is of it ſelfe nothing, neither is it of any importance with God, ſaue onely in as much as it is referred vnto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They committed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to the Lord.</hi> We gather hereby firſt, what great care Paul and Barnabas had for the ſaluation of thoſe, who by their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrie were turned vnto the Lord. For they teſtifie that in this infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the fleſh men be ſubiect to more dangers, then that their faith can continue ſtedfaſt through his owne ſtrength. Therefore this is the only refuge and aid, if the Lord keepe them continually whom he hath once receiued. And when Luke ſaith that they were commended to God in whom they beleeued, there commeth no ſmall confidence hence vnto vs: becauſe he aſſigneth this office to God as proper to him, to ſaue and defend all thoſe who by true faith haue embraced his word.</p>
               <p n="24">24 <hi>Paſſing through Piſidia.</hi> We haue alreadie ſaid that Paul and Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas came to Antioch of Piſidia: being now about to returne to Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och of Syria, whence they were ſent away: they go through Pamphilia, which is the midle region toward the mount Taurus. And Perga, &amp; At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talia are Cities lying neere togither. And whereas Luke ſaith that they preach the word in the one only, wee may thereby gueſſe that they had not opportunitie offered them euery where to teach, which they were wont to neglect or let paſſe no where.</p>
               <p n="26">26 <hi>When they had bin commended.</hi> Luke might haue ſaid that they were ordained there to bee the Apoſtles of the Gentiles, but by a circuit of words he doth more plainly expreſſe, that they were neither ſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of men, neither did they attempt any thing truſting to their owne ſtrength, but that their whol iorney togither with the ſucceſſe was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to God the authour thereof. Therefore their preaching was no mans worke, but a worke of the grace of God. And the word Grace is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred as well vnto the power and efficacie of the Spirit, as alſo vnto all the reſt of the ſignes of fauour: becauſe all thoſe giftes bee free which God beſtoweth vpon his ſeruants. And the ſentence may be thus reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that they praied God that he would ſhew forth his grace, to further the labours of his ſeruants.</p>
               <p n="27">27 <hi>After they had called the Church togither.</hi> As thoſe who returne from an embaſſage vſe to giue an account of their Actes: ſo Paule and Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas declare to the Church al the ſum of their voyage: that it may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by appeare what good ſucceſſe they had &amp; how faithfully they behaued themſelues in their office: and alſo that they may exhort the faithful to giue tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ks to god, as the thing it ſelf gaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> large matter: therfore Luk ſaith not that they did extol the things which they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues had done,
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:7788:183"/> but whatſoeuer things the Lord had done by them. It is word for word, With them: but according to the phraſe of the Hebrew tongue it is all one, as if it had beene ſaide, In them, or By them, or Toward them, or ſimply To them, in the Datiue caſe. Therefore Luke doeth not ſay <hi>ſun autois,</hi> but <hi>meta autoon:</hi> which I ſay for this cauſe, leaſt any vnskilfull man aſcribe ſome part of the praiſe to Paul and Barnabas, as if they had bin partners with God in the worke: whereas he doth rather make him the onely author of all thoſe famous factes which they had done. Luke addeth immediatly after, that the Lord had opened the doore of faith to the Gentiles. For though they were ſent vnto the Gentiles, yet the ſtrangeneſſe of the matter cauſeth them to woonder not a little: &amp; not only the ſodaine change did make the Iews aſtonied: but alſo becauſe it was to them as it were a monſter, that vnclean me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; ſuch as were ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers from the kingdome of God, ſhould be mixed with the holy ſeede of Abraham, that they might both togither make one &amp; the ſame Church, of God: they are now taught by the euent it ſelfe, that it was not for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that there were Apoſtles ſent to them. Moreouer it is ſaide that the doore of faith was ſet open to the Gentiles, not onely becauſe the Goſpel was preached to them with the externall voice: but becauſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing illuminate by the Spirit of God, they were called effectuallie vnto the faith. The kingdome of heauen is in deed ſet open to vs by the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall preaching of the Goſpel: but no man entreth in ſaue he to whom God reacheth out his hand: no man draweth neere vnleſſe he be drawn inwardly by the Spirit. Therefore Paul and Barnabas ſhowe and proue by the effect, that their calling was approued and ratified by God: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the faith of the Gentiles was as it were a ſeale ingrauen by the hand of God,<note place="margin">Rom. 16.15. 2.

                  <pb n="349" facs="tcp:7788:183"/>1 When Paul and Barnabas had endured many cumbates againſt the profeſſed enimies of the Goſpel: Luke doth nowe begin to declare that they were tried by domeſticall warre. So that it was meete that their doctrine and miniſterie ſhould be proued by all meanes, to the end it might the better appeare that they were furniſhed by God and armed againſt all the aſſaults of the worlde and Satan. For that was no ſmall confirmation for their doctrine, in that being ſhaken and battered with ſo manie ingines, it ſtood neuertheleſſe, neither could the courſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of be broken off by ſo many hinderances. Therefore to this ende doeth Paul boaſt that he ſuffered fights without and terrors within.<note place="margin">2. Cor. 7.5.</note> This hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorie is moſt worthie the noting. For though we do all naturallie abhor the croſſe and all manner perſecution, yet ciuill &amp; domeſtical diſcord is more daungerous, leaſt happily they diſcourage vs. When tyrants bend their force and run violently vpon men, fleſh in deed is afraid, &amp; al thoſe who are not indued with the ſpirite of fortitude, doe tremble with all their heart: but then their conſciences are not properly touched with any temptation. For this is knowne to be as it were the fatall eſtate of the Church. But when it falleth out ſo that the brethren go togither by the eares, and that the Church is on an vprore within it ſelfe, it cannot be but that weake minds ſhalbe troubled and alſo faint: and eſpecially when the controuerſie is about doctrine, which alone is the holy bond of brotherly vnitie: finallie there is nothing which doth more indamage the Goſpel, then ciuill diſcord: becauſe it doeth not onely pearce and wound weake conſciences, but alſo miniſter occaſion to the wicked to backbite. Wherefore we muſt diligently note this hiſtorie, that we may know that it is no new example, if among thoſe who profeſſe the ſame Goſpel there ariſe ſome wranglings &amp; ſtrife about doctrin, when proud men can get them a name (wherof they are ſo furiouſly deſirous) by no other meanes, but by bringing in their owne inuentions. It is certaine, that as there is but one god, ſo there is but one truth of this God. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when Paul goeth about to exhort the faithful vnto mutual conſent, hee vſeth this argument, One God, one faith, one Baptiſme &amp;c.<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4.6.</note> But when we ſee wicked men ariſe, who go about both to deuide the Church by their factions, and alſo either to corrupt the Goſpel with their falſe and filthie inuentions, or elſe to bring the ſame in ſuſpition: wee ought to know the ſubtiltie of Satan. Therefore Paul ſaith elſewhere that he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies come abroad, that thoſe who are tried, may bee made manifeſt.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.19.</note> And aſſuredly the Lord doth wonderfully make void the ſubtiltie of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, in that he trieth the faith of his by ſuch trials, and doeth beutifie his word with worthy and excellent victorie: and cauſeth the trueth to ſhine more clearelie, which the wicked went about to darken. But it is very conuenient to weigh all the circumſtances of the hiſtorie which Luke noteth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Which came downe from Iudea.</hi> This cloake and colour was very force<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to deceiue euen good men then. Ieruſalem was honored not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe among all Churches: becauſe they reuerenced it euen as their mother. For the Goſpel was deducted as it were by pypes and conduits
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:7788:184"/> from that fountaine. Theſe ſeducers come thence: they pretend the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles: they boaſt that they bring nothing but that which they learned of them. They blind &amp; bleare the eies of the vnskilfull with this ſmoke: &amp; thoſe who are light and wicked do greedily ſnatch at the color which is offered the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The perturbation of the church, doth like a tempeſt ſhake thoſe who were otherwiſe good &amp; moderate, ſo that they are inforced to ſtumble. Therfore we muſt note this ſubtilty of ſatan, that he abuſeth the names of holy men, that he may deceiue the ſimple, who being won with the reuerence of the men, dare not inquire after the thing it ſelfe. Luke doth not expres in deed with what affection theſe knaues were moued: yet it is likely that peruerſe zeale was the cauſe which moued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſet the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues againſt Paul &amp; Barnabas. For ther be certain churliſh natures which nothing can pleaſe but that which is their owne. They had ſeene that circumciſion and other rites of the law were obſerued at Ieruſalem: wherſoeuer they become,<note place="margin">

                     </gap>. Cor. 11.14.</note> they can abide nothing which is not agreable thereto: as if the example of one church did bind al the reſt of the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches with a certain Law. And though ſuch be caried with a prepoſterous zeale to procure tumults: yet are they pricked inwardly with their ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp; with a certain kind of ſtubbernes. Neuertheles ſatan hath that he would: for the minds of the godly haue ſuch a miſt caſt before them, that they can ſcarce know black from white. Therfore we muſt beware firſt of this plague that ſome preſcribe not a law to otherſome after their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: that the example of one church be not a preiudice of a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon rule. Alſo we muſt vſe another caution, that the perſons of men do not hinder or darken the examination of the matter or cauſe. For if Satan tranſfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure himſelf into an Angel of light, &amp; if by ſacrilegious boldnes he vſurp the holy name of God: what maruell is it, if he doe like wickedly deceiue men vnder the names of holy men? The end ſhall at length declare that the Apoſtles meant nothing leſſe, than to lay the yoke of the Law vpon the necke of the Gentiles: and yet Satan meant vnder this ſhift to get in. So it falleth out oftentimes that thoſe who contrary the doctrine of Chriſt, creepe in vnder the title of his ſeruants. Therefore there is one only remedie, to come to ſearch out the matter with ſound iudgements: alſo it behoueth vs to preuent an offence leaſt we think that the faithful ſeruants of God doe therefore ſtriue among themſelues: becauſe Satan doth falſely abuſe their names, that he may ſet certaine ſhadowes by the cares togither to terrifie the ſimple.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>When there was ſedition ariſen.</hi> This was no ſmall triall in that Paul and Barnabas are hailed into a troubleſome tumult. There was miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe ynough alreadie in the matter it ſelfe: but it is a more cruell miſchiefe, when the contention waxeth ſo hote, that they are enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to fight with their brethren as with enimies. Adde moreouer the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famie, wherewith they ſaw themſelues burdened among the ſimple and vnskilfull, as if they would trouble the peace of the Church with their ſtubbernes. For it falleth out oftentimes ſo, that the faithful ſeruants of Chriſt are enuied alone, and beare al the blame, after that they haue bin vniuſtly troubled, &amp; haue faithfully emploied themſelues in defenſe of a
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:7788:184"/> good cauſe. Therefore they muſt be endewed with inuincible courage to deſpiſe al falſe reports which are caried about concerning them. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Paul boaſteth in an other place that he went through the midſt of ſeditions. But the ſeruants of God muſt obſerue ſuch moderation,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 6.5.</note> that they abhor ſo much as they can all diſcord: if at any time Satan raiſe tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults and contentions, let them indeuour to appeaſe them: and finallie let them do all that they can to foſter and cheriſh vnitie. But againe on the other ſide when the truth of god is aſſailed, let them refuſe no cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate for defenſe therof: ne let them feare to oppoſe themſelues valiant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly though heauen and earth goe togither. And let vs being admoniſhed by this example, learn, ſo ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as there ariſeth any tumult in the church, wiſely to weigh through whoſe fault it came, leaſt we raſhly conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne the miniſters of Chriſt: whoſe grauitie is rather to be praiſed, becauſe they can abide ſo valiantly ſuch violent aſſaults of Satan. Secondly let vs call to minde that Satan was bridled by the wonderfull prouidence of God, that he might not put the doctrine of Paul to the foile. For if he had bin ſuffered to do hurt at his pleaſure ſo ſoone as the faith of the Gentiles had bin pulled downe and ouerthrowne the Goſpell preached by Paul ſhould haue fallen to the ground, and the gate ſhould haue ſhut againſt the calling of the Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiles. Thirdly let vs learne that we muſt in time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent diſſention of what ſort ſo euer it be, leaſt it break out into the flame of contention: becauſe ſatan ſeeketh nothing elſe by the fans of diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but to kindle ſo many fires. But againe ſeeing we ſee the primitiue Church on an vprore, and the beſt ſeruantes of Chriſt exerciſed with ſedition, if the ſame thing befall vs nowe, let vs not feare as in ſome newe and vnwonted matter: but crauing at the Lords handes ſuch an end as he now made, let vs paſſe through tumults with the ſame tenour of faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vnleſſe yee be Circumciſed.</hi> Luke ſetteth downe briefly in theſe words the ſtate of the queſtion: to wit, that theſe ſeducers went about to bind mens conſciences with neceſſitie of keeping the Law. Circumciſion is in deed mentioned alone in this place: but it appeareth by the text that they moued the queſtion about the keeping of the whole lawe. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Circumciſion was as it were a ſolemne entrance and admiſſion into other rites of the lawe, therefore by Synecdoche the whole lawe is comprehended vnder one part. Theſe enimies of Paul did not denie that Chriſt was the Meſſias: but though they gaue him their names, they retained therewithall the old ceremonies of the Lawe. The Error might haue ſeemed tollerable at the firſt glimſe. Why doeth not Paule then diſſemble, at leaſt for ſome ſhort time, leaſt hee ſhake the Church with conflict? For the diſputation was concerning exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall matters, concerning which Paule himſelfe forbiddeth elſewhere to ſtande and ſtriue too much. But there were three weightie cauſes which enforced him to gaineſtande. For if the keeping of the lawe bee neceſſarie, mans ſaluation is tyed to workes, which muſt be grounded in the grace of Chriſt alone, that the faith may bee ſetled and quiet. Therefore when Paule ſawe the worſhippe of the lawe ſet againſt
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:7788:185"/> the free righteouſnes of faith, it was vnlawful for him to hold his peace, vnleſſe he would betraie Chriſt. For ſeeing the aduerſaries did denie that any ſhould be ſaued, ſaue he which did obſerue the Law of Moſes, by this meanes they did tranſlate vnto workes the glorie of ſaluation, which they tooke from Chriſt, &amp; hauing ſhaken aſſurance they did vex miſerable ſoules with vnquietneſſe: againe it was no ſmall thing neither of any ſmal importance to ſpoile &amp; rob faithful ſoules of the liberty got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by Chriſts blood. Though the inward libertie of the Spirit were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the fathers as wel as to vs, yet we know what Paul ſaith, that they were ſhut vp vnder the childiſh ward &amp; cuſtodie of the Law, ſo that they did not much differ from ſeruants:<note place="margin">Gal. 4.13.</note> but we are looſe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſchoolema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterſhip of the law after that Chriſt was reuealed, &amp; we haue more liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the time of our nonage being as it were ended. The third vice of this doctrine was, becauſe it darkned the light of the Church, or at leaſt did put in as it were certaine clouds, that Chriſt the ſonne of righteouſnes might not giue perfect light. In ſumme, Chriſtianitie ſhould ſhortly haue come to nothing, if Paul ſhould haue yeelded to ſuch beginnings. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he entreth the cumbate not for the external vncircumciſion of the fleſh, but for the free ſaluation of men. Secondly that he may acquit and ſet free godly conſciences from the curſſe of the Lawe, and the gilt of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall death. Laſt of all that after all hinderances are driuen away, the brightnes of the grace of Chriſt may ſhine as in a pleaſant and cleare heauen. Moreouer theſe knaues did great iniurie to the Law when they did wickedly corrupt the right vſe thereof. This was the naturall and right office of the Law, to lead men by the hand like a ſcholemaſter vnto Chriſt: therefore it could not be worſe corrupt, then when vnder colour of it, the power and grace of Chriſt were diminiſhed. After this ſort muſt we looke into the fountaines of all queſtions, leaſt by our ſilence we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray the truth of God, ſo often as we ſee ſatan by his ſubtiltie aime right at it: neither let our mindes be changed and wax faint through any pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rils, or reproches and ſlanders: becauſe we muſt conſtantly defend pure religion though heauen and earth muſt goe togither.<note place="margin">2. Tim. 2.24.</note> The ſeruaunts of Chriſt muſt be no fighters: therefore if there bee any contention riſen, they muſt rather ſtudie to appeaſe and pacifie the ſame by their mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, than by and by to blow to the aſſault. Secondly they muſt take good heed of ſuperfluous and vaine conflicts: neither ſhall they handle controuerſies of any ſmal weight: but when they ſee Satan wax ſo proud, that religion cannot any longer continue ſafe and ſound vnleſſe he bee preuented, they muſt needs take a good hart to them, and riſe to reſiſt: neither let them feare to enter euen moſt hatefull cumbates. The name of peace is in deed plauſible and ſweete: but curſed is that peace which is purchaſed with ſo great loſſe, that we ſuffer the doctrine of Chriſt to periſh, by which alone wee growe togither into godly and holy vnitie. The Papiſts cauſe vs at this day to be ſore hated, as if we had beene the cauſers of deadly tumults, wherewith the world is ſhaken, but wee can well defend our ſelues, becauſe the blaſphemies which we indeuoured to reproue, were more cruell, than that it was lawfull for vs to holde our
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:7788:185"/> peace. Therefore we are not to be blamed, becauſe we haue taken vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vs to enter cumbates in defence of that cauſe, for which we were to fight euen with the verie Angels. Let them crie till their throates bee ſore, Paul his example is ſufficient for vs, that we muſt not bee either cold or ſlacke in defending the doctrine of godlines, when the miniſters of ſatan ſeeke to ouerthrow it with might and maine. For their brainſick diſtemperature ought not to paſſe the conſtancie of the ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of god. When Paul did zealouſly ſet himſelf againſt the falſe Apoſtles, ſedition began at length by reaſon of the conflict: and yet the Spirit of God doth not therefore reproue him, but doth rather with due praiſes commend that fortitude which he had giuen that holy man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They determined &amp;c.</hi> The Spirit of God put them in minde of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie to appeaſe the tumult, which might otherwiſe haue gone farther with doing much hurt. Whereby we be alſo taught, that we muſt alwaies ſeeke ſuch meanes as be fit for ending diſcorde: becauſe God doeth ſo highly commende peace, let the faithfull ſhewe that they doe what they can to nouriſh the peace of the Church. The trueth muſt alwayes be firſt in order with them, in defenſe whereof they muſt be afraid of no tumults. Yet they muſt ſo temper their heat, that they refuſe no meanes of godly agreement: yea let them of their owne accord inuent what wayes ſo euer they can, and let them be wittie in ſeeking the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt obſerue this meane: leaſt being carried away through im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate vehemencie of zeale, we be carried beyond the iuſt boundes. For we muſt bee couragious in defenſe of true doctrine, not ſtubberne, nor raſh. Therefore let vs learne to ioyne togither theſe two vertues which the Spirit of God commendeth in Paul. When he is drawne into the field by the wicked, he is not afraid boldly to offer himſelf: but when he doth meekely admit the remedie which was offered, hee declareth plainly what ſmall deſire he had to fight. For otherwiſe hee might haue boaſted that he did not paſſe for the Apoſtles, &amp; ſo haue ſtood ſtoutly in that: but the deſire of peace did not ſuffer him to refuſe their iudgment. Moreouer ignorant and weak men ſhould haue conceiued a ſiniſter opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, if they ſhould haue ſeene two men only ſeperated from al the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants of Chriſt. And godly teachers muſt in no caſe neglect this way to cheriſh faith, that they may ſhew that they agree with the church. Paul in deed did not depend vpon the becke of the Apoſtles, that he woulde change his opinion, if he ſhould haue found them contrary to him, who would not haue giuen place euen to the very Angels,<note place="margin">Gal. 1.8.</note> as hee boaſteth in firſt Chapt. to the Galathians. But leaſt the wicked ſhould ſlanderouſly report that he was a man that ſtoode too much in his owne conceit and which was too proud, &amp; which did pleaſe himſelf with an vnſeemly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of all men: he offered to giue an account of his doctrine, as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came him, &amp; as it was profitable for the Church. Secondly he preſented himſelfe before the Apoſtles with ſure hope of victorie, becauſe he knew full well what would be their iudgement: ſeing they were guided by the ſame ſpirit wherewith he was gouerned. Notwithſtanding it may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded for what purpoſe the men of Antioch ſent Paul and Barnabas
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:7788:186"/> vnto the reſt of the Apoſtles. For if they did ſo greatly reuerence them, that they ſtood in doubt, vntil they had giuen iudgement on this ſide or that, their faith was hitherto vaine and altogither none. But the anſwer is eaſie: Seing they knew that all the Apoſtles were ſent by Chriſt alone with the ſame commandements, and that they had the ſame Spirite gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen them, they were fully perſwaded of the end &amp; ſucceſſe, and vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly this counſel proceeded from honeſt &amp; ſtout men, who were not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant that the knaues did falſely pretend the names of Iames &amp; Peter. Wherfore they ſought nothing elſe but that the Apoſtles might further a good matter with their conſent. To the ſame end were all holy Synods aſſembled ſince the beginning, that graue men and ſuch as were wel ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed in the worde of God might decide controuerſies, not after their owne pleaſure, but according to the authority of God. This is worth the noting, leaſt the papiſts pearce any man with their loud outcries, who to the end they may ouerthrow Chriſt, and his Goſpel, and put out all the light of godlines: thruſt vpon vs Councels: as if euery definition &amp; deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of men wer to be counted an heauenly oracle. But if the holy fathers had their fitting at this day, they would cry with one mouth, that there was nothing more vnlawful for them, neither did they meane any thing leſſe, than to ſet downe or deliuer any thing, without hauing the word of Chriſt for their guid, who was their onely teacher euen as he is ours. I omit this that the Papiſts leane onely vnto vntimely Councels which breath out nothing but groſſe ignorance and Barbariſme. But e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the beſt &amp; moſt choiſe muſt be reckened in that number, that they may be ſubiect to the worde of God. There is a greeuous complaint of Gregorie Nazianzene extant, that there was neuer any Councell which had a good ende. What excellencie ſo euer did floriſh and was in force in the Church, it cannot bee denyed but that it began to decay an hundred yeeres after. Therefore if that holy man were nowe liuing how ſtoutlie woulde hee reiect the toyes of the Papiſtes? who without all ſhame moſt impudently bring in the iuglings of viſures in ſteede of lawfull Councels, and that to that ende, that the worde of God may packe, ſo ſoone as a few bald and fooliſh men haue ſet downe whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer pleaſed them.</p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>Being brought on the way by the Church.</hi> Where as by the common conſent of the Church there were ioined to Paul and Barnabas compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, who might for dueties ſake conduct them, we may therby gather, that all the godly were on their ſide: &amp; that they did neuer otherwiſe thinke but that the cauſe was theirs as well as the Apoſtles. Wherefore they determined the iourney of Paul and Barnabas with like minds as they tooke it in hande: to wit, that they might tame and put to ſilence thoſe troubleſome ſpirites, who did falſely make boaſt of the Apoſtles. Whereas he ſaith ſhortly after that they certified the brethren in their voyage of the wonderful conuerſion of the Gentiles, it is a teſtimony &amp; token that they came not to Ieruſalem fraught with feare: but that they did euen without feare ſtoutly profeſſe that which they had taught be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Therefore they come not to plead their cauſe before their iudges:
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:7788:186"/> but that they may with common conſent and iudgement, on both ſides approue that which was commanded by God touching the aboliſhing of ceremonies. For though they did not deſpiſe the iugement of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, yet becauſe they knew that it was not lawfull for them, neither for the Apoſtles to decree otherwiſe concerning the cauſe, it did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them to ſtand as men whoſe matter is handled at the bar: thence commeth the boldnes of reioycing. To this end tendeth the ioy of the godly wherby they ſubſcribe both to the doctrine of Paul, &amp; alſo the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Gentiles.</p>
               <p n="4">4 <hi>They were receiued of the Church.</hi> By this word Church he meaneth the multitude it ſelfe and the whole bodie: that done he aſſigneth a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar place to the Apoſtles and Elders, by whom Paul and Barnabas were ſpecially receiued. Furthermore becauſe the Apoſtles had no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine place of abode at Ieruſalem: but went euer now and then ſomtimes to one place and ſomtimes to another, whither ſoeuer occaſion did call them, that Church had Elders to whom the ordinarie gouernement of the Church was committed:<note place="margin">Chr. 14.23.</note> and what the one function differeth from the other we haue before declared. And hereby it appeareth what bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly curteſie there was in the Apoſtles and Elders, becauſe they doe not onely courteouſly receiue Paul and Barnabas: but ſo ſoone as they heare what ſucceſſe they had with their paines they tooke, they magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the grace of God. Luke repeateth againe that forme of ſpeech which we had before in the chapter next going before, when he ſaith that they declared whatſoeuer things God had done with them. Wherin we muſt remember that which I ſaid before, that God is not made a fellow labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, but all the whole praiſe of the worke is aſcribed to him. Therefore it is ſaide that hee did that with Paul and Barnabas, which hee did by them: as he is ſaid to deale mercifully with vs, when he helpeth our miſeries.</p>
               <p n="5">5 <hi>Certaine of the ſect of the Phariſees.</hi> It is not without cauſe that Luke expreſſeth what kinde of men they were, which went about to trouble or hinder Paul euen at Ieruſalem alſo. And it is to bee thought that the euill flowed from that fountaine: and that Luke doeth nowe more plainely expreſſe, that there brake out nowe alſo fannes, out of that verie ſame fect, from whence the authours of that wicked diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion came. For though they had giuen Chriſt their names, yet there remained reliques of their former nature. We knowe howe proude the Phariſees were, howe hautie, howe loftie their lookes were: all which they woulde haue forgotten, if they had truely put on Chriſt. like as there remained no phariſeiſme in Paul, but a great part had gotten the habite of ſtubbernneſſe by long cuſtome which they could not ſhake off ſo eaſily by and by. Foraſmuch as there reigned moſt of all among them hypocriſie: they were too much addicted to external rites, which are couerings for vices. They were likewiſe puffed vp with pride, ſo that they did tyrannouſly couet to make all other men ſubiect to their decrees. It is wel knowne how ſore ſicke the munks are of both diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes. Wherby it commeth to paſſe that nothing is more cruel than they
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:7788:187"/> to oppreſſe the Church, nothing is more wicked or froward then they to deſpiſe the word of god. Moreouer we ſee many of them which came out of thoſe dennes which haue caſt from them their cowle, and yet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

<pb n="357" facs="tcp:7788:187"/> of other men and their owne alſo. They thought that Circumciſion was an eternal &amp; vnuiolable token of Gods couenant: the ſame opinion had they of all the whole Lawe. Wherefore Peter ſtandeth chiefely vppon this, to ſhewe the ſtate of the queſtion, which the moſt of them knewe not. And his oration hath two members. For firſt he proueth by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tority of god, that the gentiles muſt not be enforced to keep the law: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly he teacheth that all mans ſaluation is ouerthrowne, if the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience be once caught in this ſnare. Therefore the former part (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he declareth that he was ſent of God to teach the Gentiles, and that the holy Spirite came downe vpon them) tendeth to this end, that men did not vnaduiſedly diſanull the ceremonies of the Law, but that God is the author of that diſanulling. And ſo ſoone as the authoritie of God is brought foorth, all doubting is taken away becauſe this is all our wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, to ſtay our ſelues vpon the authority, gouernment and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of God, and to make more account of his becke and pleaſure, then of all reaſons. Now it is meete that we ponder the words of Peter, whereby he proueth that this was granted to the gentiles by God, to be free from the yoke of the Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You know.</hi> He calleth them to beare witneſſe, and vnto them hee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealeth, leaſt any man ſhould thinke that he is about to ſpeake of ſome darke and doubtfull thing. The hiſtorie was well knowne to them all. That which remained, he ſheweth that they were blind euen in moſt cleare light, becauſe they do not rightly conſider &amp; marke the worke of God, yea becauſe they had not long agoe learned that which was open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhewed. He calleth the beginning of the preaching of the Goſpel Old dayes, or the old time: as if he ſhould ſay, Long agoe: as it were ſince the firſt beginning of the Church, after that Chriſt began to gather to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe any people.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>God did chooſe in vs.</hi> The word Chooſe doth ſignifie to apoint or decree. Though Peter doth comprehend as wel the free Election of God, as the choiſe, whereby God did adopt the Gentiles to be his people. Therefore he choſe, that is as it were making choiſe, that he might ſhew a token of his free election in the gentiles, he would that by my mouth they ſhould heare the doctrin of the goſpel. Theſe words, In vs, do import as much, as in our ſight, or we being witneſſes, or, among vs. For his meaning is that he declareth nothing, but that which they knew full well, to wit, which was done before their eies. The phraſe is common ynough both among the Grecians, &amp; alſo among the Hebritians: vnleſſe we had leffer reſolue it as ſome other do, He hath choſen me out of this company.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And beleeue.</hi> This was a ſeale to confirme the calling of the Gentiles. The office of teaching was inioyned Peter by an oracle: but the fruite which came of his doctrine, doth make his miniſtery noble, &amp; authenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, as they call it. For ſeeing that the elect are illuminate into the faith by a peculiar grace of the Spirit, doctrin ſhal bring forth no fruit, vnleſſe the Lord ſhew forth his power in his miniſters: in teaching the mindes of thoſe inwardly which heare, and in drawing their hearts inwardly. Therefore ſeing the Lord commanded that the doctrine of the Goſpel
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:7788:188"/> ſhould be brought vnto the Gentiles, he did ſanctifie them to himſelfe, that they might be no longer prophane. But the ſolemne conſecration was then perfect in al points, when he imprinted in their hearts by faith, the marke of their adoption. The ſentence which followth immediatlie is to be vnderſtood as ſet down by way of expoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For Peter annexeth the viſible graces of the Spirite vnto faith: as aſſuredlie they were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but an addition thereof. Therefore ſeeing that the Gentiles are ingraffed into the people of God without Circumciſion and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, Peter gathereth that it was not well done to lay vpon them any neceſſitie to keepe the Law. Yet it ſeemeth to be but a weake argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to proue their Election withal, becauſe the holy ghoſt came down vpon them. For they were ſuch giftes that they could not reaſon from the ſame, that they were reckoned in the number of the godly. But it is the Spirit of regeneration alone, which diſtinguiſheth the children of God from ſtrangers. I anſwere, Though men who were otherwiſe vaine, were indued with the gift of tongues and ſuch like: yet doth Peter take for a thing which all men grant, that which was knowne, that God had ſealed in Cornelius and his coſins, his free adoption by the viſible grace of the Spirite, as if hee ſhould point out his children with his finger.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The knower of the hearts.</hi> He applieth this adiunct to God according to the circumſtance of the preſent matter: and it hath vnder it a ſecreat contrarietie, That men are more addicted to externall puritie, becauſe they iudge according to their groſſe &amp; earthly ſenſe and vnderſtanding: but God doth looke into the heart. Therefore Peter teacheth that they iudge prepoſterouſly in this matter according to mans vnderſtanding, ſeing that the inward purenes of the hart alone is here to be eſteemed, which we know not. And by this meanes doeth he bridle our raſhneſſe, leaſt taking to our ſelues more than we ought, we murmur againſt the iudgement of God. As if he ſhould ſay: If thou ſee no reaſon of that te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony which God gaue them, thinke with thy ſelfe what great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence there is betweene him &amp; thee. For thou art holden with external pompe according to thy groſſe nature, which muſt be abandoned, when we come to the throne of God, where the hearts of men are knowne ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually. But in the meane ſeaſon we muſt note a generall doctrine, that the eyes of God doe not looke vpon the vaine pompe of men, but vpon the integritie of mens harts, as it is written Ier. 5.<note place="margin">Iere. 5.3.</note> Wheras the old inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter &amp; Eraſmus tranſlate it, that God knoweth the hearts, it doth not ſufficiently expreſſe that which Luke ſaith in greek: for when he calleth God <hi>Cardiagnosten,</hi> he ſetteth him againſt men, who iudge rather for the moſt part by the vtwarde appearance: and therefore they may be called <hi>proſopognoſtai</hi> or knowers of the face, if they be compared with God.</p>
               <p n="9">9 <hi>And he put no difference.</hi> There was in deede ſome difference, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Gentiles who were vncircumciſed were ſodainely admitted vnto the couenant of eternall life: where as the Iewes were prepared by circumciſion vnto faith. But Peters meaning is, that they were both choſen togither by God vnto the hope of the ſame inheritance, and
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:7788:188"/> that they were extolled into the like degree of honour, that they might be the children of God &amp; members of Chriſt, and finally the holy ſeede of Abraham, a prieſtly and princely generation. Whereupon it follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth that they cannot without ſacrilege be counted vncleane,<note place="margin">Ephe. 2.14</note> ſithence God hath choſen them to bee a peculiar people, and hath conſecrated them to be holy veſſels of his temple. For the wall of ſeperation being pulled downe whereby the Gentiles and Iewes were diuided among themſelues, hee hath ioyned the Gentiles to the Iewes, that they might growe togither into one bodie: and that I may ſo ſaie, hee hath mixed circumciſion and vncircumciſion togither, that as well thoſe of the houſeholde as ſtraungers may bee one in Chriſt, and may make one Church: and that there may not be any longer either Iew or Grecian.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seing that by faith he had purified.</hi> This member is anſwerable to that former adiunct which he applied to god: as if he ſhuld ſay, that god who knoweth the hearts, did inwardly purge the Gentiles, when he vouchſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed to make them partakers of his adoption, that they might be indued with ſpirituall cleannes. But he addeth farther that this puritie did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in faith. Therefore he teacheth firſt that the Gentiles haue true ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines without ceremonies, which may ſuffice before Gods iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſeat. Secondly he teacheth that this is attained vnto by faith, &amp; from it doth it flow. In like ſort Paul gathereth,<note place="margin">Rom. 4.1.</note> that vncircumciſion doth not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a man but that be may be counted holy and iuſt before god: becauſe Circumciſion did follow after righteouſnes in the perſon of Abraham, and by order of time it was latter. But here ariſeth a queſtion, whether that purity which the fathers had in times paſt were vnlike to that which God gaue now to the Gentiles. For it ſeemeth that Peter diſtinguiſheth the gentiles from the Iewes by this mark, becauſe being conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t with the cleanneſſe of the heart alone, they need no helpe of the Law. I anſwere that the one of them differ from the other, not in ſubſtance, but in forme. For God had reſpect alwayes vnto the inward cleannes of the heart: and the ceremonies were giuen to the old people onely for this cauſe; that they might helpe their faith. So that cleannes as touching figures and exerciſes, was onely for a time, vntil the comming of Chriſt, which hath no place among vs at this day: like as there remaineth from the very beginning of the world vnto the ende, the ſame true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, to wit, the ſpirituall worſhip: yet is there great difference in the viſible forme, Nowe wee ſee that the fathers did not obtaine righteouſneſſe by Ceremonies, neither were they therefore pure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God: but by the cleanneſſe of the heart. For the Ceremonies of themſelues were of no importance to iuſtifie them: but they were onely helpes, which did accidentally (that I may ſo terme it) purge them: yet ſo that the fathers and we had the ſame truth. Now when Chriſt came, all that which was accidentall did vaniſh away: and therefore ſeeing the ſhadowes be driuen away, there remaineth the bare &amp; plaine pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the heart. Thus is that obiection eaſily anſwered which the Iewes thinke cannot poſſiblie bee anſwered,<note place="margin">Gen. 17.13</note> Circumciſion is called
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:7788:189"/> the eternall couenant, or of the world: therefore ſay they, it was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ot to be aboliſhed. If any man ſhall ſay that this is not referred vnto the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſigne, but rather vnto the thing figured: it ſhall bee well anſwered, but there is another anſwere beſides this. Seeing that the kingdome of Chriſt was a certaine renewing of the world, there ſhall no inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence follow, if he made an end of all the ſhadowes of the Lawe. For as much as the perpetuitie of the Law is grounded in Chriſt. I come now vnto the ſecond member, where Peter placeth the cleanneſſe of the Gentiles in faith. Why doth not he ſay, In perfection of vertues, or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe of life ſaue onely becauſe men haue righteouſnes from another, and not from themſelues? for if men by liuing well and iuſtly ſhould pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe righteouſneſſe, or if they ſhould be cleane before God by nature: this ſentence of Peter ſhould fall to ground. Therefore the Spirit doth in theſe words plainly pronounce, that all mankind is polluted and with filthines defiled: ſecondly that their blots can by no other meanes be wiped away, than by the grace of Chriſt. For ſeing that faith is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie whereby the Lord doth freely helpe vs, it is ſet as wel againſt the common nature of all men, as againſt euery mans owne merites. When I ſay that al mankind is polluted, my meaning is, that we bring nothing from our mothers wombe but meere filthineſſe, and that there is no righteouſneſſe in our nature, which can reconcile vs to God. Mans ſoul was in deed indewed with ſingular giftes at the firſt: but all parts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are ſo corrupt with ſinne, that there remaineth in it no droppe of pureneſſe any longer, therefore we muſt ſeeke for cleanneſſe without our ſelues. For if any man alledge that it may be recouered by merits of workes: there is nothing more abſurd than to imagine that wicked and froward nature can deſerue any thing. Therefore it reſteth that men ſeeke elſewhere for that, which they ſhall neuer be able to finde within themſelues. And ſurely it is the office of faith to tranſlate that vnto vs which is proper to Chriſt, and to make it ours by free participation. So that there is a mutuall relation betweene faith and the grace of Chriſt. For faith doth not make vs cleane, as a vertue or qualitie pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into our ſoules: but becauſe it receiueth that cleanneſſe which is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in Chriſt. Wee muſt alſo note the phraſe, that God purified the hearts: whereby Luke doth both make God the authour of faith, and he reacheth alſo that cleannes is his benefit. To make ſhort, hee ſignifieth vnto vs, that that is giuen to men by the grace of God, which they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not giue to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues. But foraſmuch as we ſaid that faith taketh that of Chriſt which it tranſpoureth into vs: we muſt now ſee how the grace of Chriſt doth make vs cleane, that we may pleaſe god. And there is a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble maner of purging, becauſe Chriſt doth offer &amp; preſent vs cleane and iuſt in the ſight of his father, by putting away our ſinnes daily, which he hath once purged by his blood: ſecondly becauſe by mortifying the luſts of the fleſh by his ſpirit, he reformeth vs vnto holines of life. I do willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comprehend both kinds of purging vnder theſe words: becauſe Luke doth not touch one kind of purging only, but he teacheth that the whol perfection thereof conſiſteth without the ceremonies of the Law.</p>
               <p n="10">
                  <pb n="361" facs="tcp:7788:189"/>10 <hi>Now therefore why tempt yee.</hi> This is the other part of the ſermon, wherin Peter ſheweth how deadly that doctrine is, which Paul his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ſought to bring in: to wit, which might drowne godly ſoules in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire. He inferreth and gathereth out of the former member, that God is tempted, if the Gentiles be inforced to keepe the law of neceſſitie: he riſeth higher and pearceth euen vnto the very fountaine. For he reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth hitherto, that the Gentiles ſhould haue iniurie done them, if there be more required at their hands, then God will, and ſeing that he made them equall with the holy people, &amp; did vouchſafe them the honour of adoption, it was an vnmeet and inconuenient matter that they ſhoulde be reiected, and ſo his liberalitie ſhould be reſtrained. For he ſaith laſt of all that this faith is ſufficient for them, though they want ceremonies. And now he taketh an higher principle, that thoſe who tie mens ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the workes of the law, leaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no good hope: but rather throw the whole worlde headlong into horrible deſtruction, if it can obtaine ſaluation by no other meanes but by keeping the lawe, with what argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments he proueth this we ſhal ſee in their place. As touching the words, ſeeing the ſcripture ſaith, that God is tempted diuers wayes, Peter his meaning is in this place, that God is prouoked as it were of ſet purpoſe, when there is an heauier burthen laid vppon men, then they be able to beare: and that his power is brought within boundes when that yoke is bound which he doth looſe, which is nothing els, but by ſtriuing againſt nature to match our ſelues with Giants, as they ſay.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the yoke ſhould be laid vpon their neckes.</hi> The meaning of the words is plaine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that God is tempted when there is laid vppon mens conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, a ſorer burden, then they are able to beare, and by this meanes the ſaluation of mens ſoules is ſore ſhaken: Seeing that they muſt needs by this meanes be drowned in deſpaire, which cannot be without their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. But that iniurie which is done to god is no whit more tollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, when as he is robbed of his right, that hee may not haue libertie to deliuer vs. But we may eaſily gather out of the thing it ſelfe, that he doth not ſpeake of the ceremonies only. The ſeruitude of the old training vp vnder the law was hard and laborious: but yet it were too abſurde to call it a yoke that cannot be borne: and we know that not only holy men, but alſo euen moſt hypocrites did wel &amp; exactly accompliſhe the outwarde obſeruation of the rites.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, it were not any hard matter to ſatisfie the morall law, if it were content with corporal obedience only, and did not require ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all righteouſneſſe. For it is graunted to many to bridle their handes and feete: but to moderate all the affections ſo, that there may reigne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect abſtinence and puritie as well in the ſoule as in the bodie, this is too hard a matter. Therfore thoſe be too fooliſh who reſtrain vnto ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies Peters woordes, whereby the weakneſſe of men to perfourme the righteouſneſſe of the hearte is expreſſed: which doeth not onely farre paſſe their ſtrength, but is altogeather contrary to nature, Theſe men were I warraunt you deceiued by one reaſon, becauſe the queſtion was moued concerning ceremonies only: but they do remember that Peter
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:7788:190"/> did more attentiuely and more wiſely conſider as became him, what a labyrinth this error (to look to, but light) did bring with it. The falſe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles did auouch that no man could attaine vnto ſaluation vnleſſe he did keepe the ceremonies. If mans ſaluation be tyed to workes, it ſhall be no longer grounded in the grace of Chriſt, and ſo by this meanes free reconciliatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhal fall flat to the ground. Now ſeeing that mans ſtrength is vnable to keepe the law, all men are ſubiect to the curſe, which the Lorde there denounceth againſt the trangreſſours, and ſo by this means all men ſhall come in daunger of deſpayre, ſeeing that they ſee them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues giltie of eternal death by the law. Peraduenture the falſe apoſtles vnderſtood theſe things craftily. But Peter pearceth the very fountain, that he may bring to light the deadly poyſon of that doctrine: and thus muſt we do, ſo often as Satan doth craftily thruſt in wicked errours. At this day we ſeem to ſome to be too contentious, when as we do ſo ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtand in this, that men muſt not pray for the dead. For it is both a moſt auncient cuſtome, neither is it a thing to looke to, very dangerous, though men powre out ſuperfluous prayers: yet it is a plauſible opinion, becauſe it carrieth ſome colour of humane godlines.</p>
               <p>Furthermore vnskilfull men iudge thus, becauſe they ſeeke not out the head ſpring. For if we graunt that men may pray for the dead, wee muſt alſo admit this, that they are nowe puniſhed by the iudgement of God, becauſe they made not ſatisfaction in this life for their ſinnes. And ſo by this means the force of Chriſtes ſatisfaction is tranſlated vnto the workes of men: ſecondly the rule of praying aright is ouerthrowen, if me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may pray at all aduenture without the word of God, this is alſo a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter abſurditie, than that we ought lightly to paſſe ouer it. In ſum, we can neuer giue true iudgement of any queſtion, vnleſſe hauing throughlye ript vp the fountain of that doctrine which is called in queſtion, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct all conſequents, which it bringeth with it. Therefore it is no maruell if Peter to the end he may pull the falſe apoſtles out by the eares, as it were out of their lurking dennes, doe generally diſpute touching the whol law: becauſe he doth nothing els but open the matter it ſelf, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the ſimple were ignorant: that they may all ſee what a deadly doctrin it is, which doth both extinguiſh the grace of Chriſt, and drown ſoules in the horrible dungeon of deſpaire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Neither we nor our fathers.</hi> Peter doth not only diſpute what men haue done in deed, but what they were able to do, neither doth he ſpeake only of the common riffe raffe, but of the holy fathers. Seeing that hee deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that they were able to beare the yoke of the lawe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is manifeſt that the law cannot poſſibly be kept. I know that Ierome his ſaying is ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally receiued, that it is as it were an vndoubted and moſt certaine <hi>maxime,</hi> If any man ſay that it is a thing vnpoſſible to keepe the law, let him be accurſſed: but we muſt not hearken to any voice of man whiche is contrary to the iudgement of the Spirit of God. Wee heare what the Spirit pronounceth in this place by the mouth of Peter, not concerning the will and workes of men, but touching their habilitie and power. And hereunto agreeth Paule, affirming that it was an vnpoſſible thing that
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:7788:190"/> the lawe ſhould giue vs life, foraſmuch as it was weak through the fleſh. In deed if any man were able to fulfill the law, he ſhoulde finde the life, which is there promiſed: but foraſmuch as Paule denyeth that life can bee gotten by the lawe, it followeth that ther is farther &amp; higher righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe required there, then man is able to perfourme. I confeſſe in deed that Ierome doth not wholy graunt to the ſtrength of nature, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to fulfill the law, but partly alſo to the grace of God: as hee doth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward expound himſelfe, that a faithfull man holpen by the grace of the Spirite, may bee ſaid to bee able to fulfill the law. But euen that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigation is not true. For if we do weigh the ſtrength of nature only, men ſhall not only be vnable to beare the yoke of the lawe: but they ſhall not be able to moue ſo much as a finger, to perfourme the leaſt iote of the law. And ſurely if that be true, that, all the cogitations of mans mind are wicked from his childhood, that all the vnderſtandings of fleſh are ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to god, that there is none which ſeeketh after God: and other ſuch places which are common in the Scripture, tending to the ſame ende:<note place="margin">Gen. 8.21. Rom. 8.7. Pſal. 14.3. Rom. 3.11.</note> but eſpecially which are cited by Paul in the third to the Romans: man his power and abilitie to fulfill the law ſhal not only be weake and lame, but altogether none, to begin. Therfore we muſt thus thinke, that euen the very faithfull after they being regenerate by the ſpirite of God, doe ſtudie to attaine vnto the righteouſneſſe of the law, doe perfourme not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding but the halfe and far leſſe then half, not the whole. For doutleſſe Peter ſpeaketh not in this place of the Epicure or profane me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but of Abraham, of Moſes, and of other holy fathers which wer the moſt perfect in the world, &amp; yet he ſaith that theſe fainted vnder the burden of the law: becauſe it did paſſe their ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth. It is hatefully obiected, that the ſpirit of God is blaſphemed, when as abilitie to fulfill the lawe is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away from his grace and help, but we may readily anſwere: becauſe the queſtion is not what the grace of the ſpirit is able to doe: but what that meaſure of grace is able to do, which God doth diuide to euery one in this life. For we muſt alwayes conſider what God doth promiſe to do; neither let vs vnaduiſedly aske this queſtion, whether that can be done which he himſelf doth teſtifie ſhall neuer be, and which he wil not haue done. He promiſeth the grace &amp; aid of the Spirit to the faithful, wherby they may be able to reſiſt the luſts of the fleſh, &amp; to ſubdue them: yet ſhal they not quite aboliſh &amp; driue them away. Hee promiſeth them grace wherby they may walk in newnes of life: yea ſhal they not be able to run ſo ſwiftly as the law requireth. For he wil haue them kept vnder during their whole life, that they may flie to beg pardon, If it be vnlawfull to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from the power of god his counſell &amp; the order by him ſet down, it is a fooliſh and vain cauill whereby the aduerſaries goe about to bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den vs, when as they ſay that we diminiſh the power of God: nay rather they transforme God when they holde that his counſell &amp; purpoſe can bee altered. The Pelagians did in times paſt in like ſort burthen Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine. Hee aunſweareth, that though it bee a thing poſſible that the law ſhoulde be fulfilled, yet is that ſufficient for him, that no man did e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer fulfill it, and that the Scripture doth not teſtifie that it ſhall bee ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:7788:191"/> vntill the end of the worlde. By which wordes hee deliuereth himſelfe from their importunate ſubtiltie. But there was no cauſe why he ſhould doubt, but freely and flatly graunt, that it might be fulfilled, the holy ghoſt being the author. For we muſt limit the grace of the ſpirit that it may agree with the promiſes. Furthermore, we haue alreadie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared how farre the promiſes reache. There is no man which moueth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie queſtion concerning this, whether god be not able if he wil, to make men perfect: but they dote fooliſhe which ſeparate his power from his counſell, whereof they haue an euident &amp; plaine teſtimonie in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. God doeth plainely declare an hundreth times what hee will and what he hath determined to doe, to goe any farther is ſacrilege. Hierom was inforced by reaſon of philoſophie to hurl out the thunderbolt of his curſe againſt Peter and Paule: becauſe the lawes muſt bee applied vnto their habilitie for whom they be appointed, which as I confeſſe to take place in mans lawes: ſo I vtterly denie that it is good as touching the lawe of God, which in exacting righteouſnes doth not reſpect what ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is able to doe, but what he ought to doe. Though here ariſeth a harder queſtion, whether the lawe were not giuen to this end, that it might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force men to obey God.</p>
               <p>And this ſhould be in vain, vnleſſe the Spirit of god ſhould direct the faithfull to keepe it: and that ſolemne proteſtation of Moſes ſeemeth to put the matter out of doubt, when he ſaith that hee giueth preceptes to the Iewes: not ſuch as they may read, but in deed fulfill. Deu. 30.<note place="margin">Deu. 30.12.</note> Whence we gather that the yoke was laid vpon the necke of the Iewes when the law was giuen, that it might make them ſubiect to God, that they might not liue as them luſted. I anſwere, that the lawe is counted a yoke two wayes. For in as much as it brideleth the luſtes of the fleſh, and deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth a rule of godly &amp; holy life, it is meet that the children of God take this yoke vpon them, but in as much as it doth exactly preſcribe what we owe to God, and doth not promiſe life without adding the condition of perfect obedience: and doth againe denounce a curſe, if we ſhall in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny point offend: it is a yoke which no man is able to beare. I will ſhewe this more plainely. The plaine doctrine of good life, wherein God doth inuite vs vnto himſelfe, is a yoke, which we muſt all of vs willingly take vp. For there is nothing more abſurd, then that God ſhould not gouerne mans life, but that hee ſhould wander at pleaſure without any bridle. Therefore we muſt not refuſe the yoke of the law,<note place="margin">Leuit. 18.5. Deu. 27.26.</note> if the ſimple doctrine thereof be conſidered. But theſe ſayinges doe otherwiſe qualifie (that I may ſo terme it) the law. He which ſhall do theſe things ſhall liue in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp;c. Again, Curſed is hee which continueth not in all thinges which are written<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that it may begin to bee a yoke which no man can beare. For ſo long as ſaluation is promiſed ro the perfect keeping of the law alone, &amp; euerie transgreſſion is called into iudgement, mankinde is vtterly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doone. In this reſpect doeth Peter affirme that God is tempted, when mans arrogancie doth burthen the conſciences of men with the Lawe. For it is not his purpoſe to denie, but that men muſt be gouerned by the doctrine of the lawe, and ſo he graunteth that they be vnder the law not
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:7788:191"/> ſimply to teach, but alſo to humble men with the gilt of eternall death, conſidering that that qualitie was annexed vnto doctrin, he affirmeth that the ſoules of the godly muſt not be tied with the yoke of the lawe: becauſe by this meanes it ſhoulde of neceſſitie come to paſſe that they ſhould be drowned in eternall deſtruction. But when as not only the grace of the holy Spirit is preſent, to gouerne vs, but alſo free forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſinnes to deliuer and acquit vs from the curſe of the Lawe: then is that of Moſes fulfilled, that the commandement is not aboue vs:<note place="margin">Deut. 30.11 Mat. 11.30.</note> and then doe we alſo perceiue how ſweet the yoke of Chriſt is, &amp; how light his burden is. For becauſe we know that through the mercy of God that is forgiuen vs, which is wanting through the infirmitie of the fleſh, Wee doe cheerefully and without any griefe take vpon vs that which hee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyneth vs. Wherefore ſo that the rigour of the lawe be taken away the doctrine of the Lawe ſhall not only be tollerable, but alſo ioyfull &amp; plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant: neither muſt we refuſe the bridle which doth gouerne vs mildly: &amp; doth not vrge vs ſorer then is expedient.</p>
               <p n="11">11 <hi>By the grace of Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> Peter compareth theſe two together as contrary the one to the other: to haue hope in the grace of Chriſt, &amp; to be vnder the yoke of the law. Which compariſon doth greatly ſet out the iuſtification of Chriſt, in as much as we gather thereby, that thoſe are iuſtified by faith, who beeing free and quit from the yoke of the lawe, ſeeke for ſaluation in the grace of Ieſus Chriſt. Furthermore, I ſaid before that the yoke of the lawe is made of two coardes. The former is, He which doth theſe things ſhall liue in them. The other, Curſed is eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one which doth not continue in all the commaundements. Let vs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne vnto the contrarie member. If we cannot otherwiſe attaine vnto ſaluation by the grace of Chriſt, vnleſſe the yoke of the lawe be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, it followeth, that ſaluation is not placed in keeping the law, neither are thoſe which beleeue in Chriſt ſubiect to the curſe of the lawe. For if he could be ſaued through grace, who is as yet in wrapped in the yoke of the lawe, then ſhould Peters reaſoning be but fooliſhe, which is drawen from contraries, thus, We hope for ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the grace of Chriſt: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are not vnder the yoke of the lawe. Vnleſſe ther were a diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment between the grace of Chriſt and the yoke of the law, Peter ſhould deceiue vs.</p>
               <p>Wherefore thoſe muſt needes depart from the righteouſneſſe of the law, whoſoeuer deſire to finde life in Chriſt. For this contrarietie apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth not vnto doctrine: but vnto the cauſe of iuſtification. Whereby is alſo refuted their ſurmiſe, who ſay that we are iuſtified by the grace of Chriſt: becauſe he regenerateth vs by his Spirit, &amp; giueth vs ſtrength to fulfil the law: thoſe who imagin this, thogh they ſeem to eaſe the yoke of the law a little, yet they keep ſoules bound with both the cordes ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. For this promiſe ſhall alwayes ſtand in force, He which ſhall do theſe thinges ſhall liue in them, on the otherſide, the curſe ſhal com vppon all which ſhall not abſolutely fulfill the lawe. Wherefore wee muſt define the grace of Chriſte farre otherwiſe (whereunto the hope of ſaluation leaneth) then they dreame: to wit, that it bee free reconciliation gotten
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:7788:192"/> by the ſacrifice of his death: or which is all one, free forgiuenes of ſins, which by pacifying and appeaſing God, doth make him of an enemie or ſeuere iudge, and which cannot be pleaſed, nor intreated, a mercifull fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I confeſſe indeed that we be regenerate into newnes of life by the grace of Chriſt: but when we are about aſſurance of ſaluation, then muſt we call to mind the free adoptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alone, which is ioined with the purging &amp; forgiueneſſe of ſins. For if workes be admitted, that they may make vs righteous euen in part only, the yoke of the law ſhall not be broken, and ſo Peter his contrarietie ſhall fall to the ground, or els be diſſolued.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Euen as they.</hi> Peter doth teſtifie in this place, that though the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitude of the law were laid vpon the Fathers as touching the externall ſhew: yet were their conſciences free and quit: whereby is put away that abſurditie, which might otherwiſe haue troubled godlie minds not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. For ſeeing that the couenant of life is eternall, and the ſame which God made with his ſeruants from the beginning vntill the ende of the world: it were an abſurd thing &amp; vntollerable that any other way to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſaluation ſhould be taught at this day, then that which the fathers had in times paſt. Therfore Peter affirmeth that we agree very wel with the fathers: becauſe they no leſſe then we repoſed hope of ſaluation in the grace of Chriſt. And ſo reconciling the law and the goſpel together, as touching the end of the doctrine, he taketh from the Iewes the ſtum<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bling blocke, which they feigned to themſelues by reaſon of the diſcord. Whereby it appeareth that the lawe was not giuen to the fathers, that they might thereby purchaſe ſaluation: neither wer the ceremonies ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that by the obſeruing thereof they might attain vnto righteouſnes: but this was the only end of all the whole lawe, that caſting from them all confidence, which they might repoſe in works, they might repoſe all their hope in the grace of Chriſt. Whereby is alſo refuted the doting of thoſe who thinke that the old people in as much as they were content with earthly goods, did think no whit of the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly life. But Peter ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the fathers partners with vs of the ſame faith: and doth make ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation common to both, and yet there bee ſome which delight in that brainſicke fellow Seruetus with his ſo filthie ſacrileges. Furthermore we muſt note that Peter teacheth that the faith of the fathers was alwaies grounded in Chriſt, ſeeing that they could neither finde life any where els, neither was there any other way for men to come vnto God. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this place agreeth with that ſaying of the Apoſtle, Chriſt yeſterday and to day,<note place="margin">Heb. 13.8.</note> and for euer.</p>

                  <hi>They heard Barnabas and Paul.</hi> We may gather by theſe words that they were not heard with ſilence before.

Wee ſee what a poyſon diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure conceiued for no cauſe, is, which doth ſo poſſeſſe mens mindes, that it ſtoppeth the way ſo, that the truth can neuer haue entrance.

               <p n="13">13 <hi>Iames anſwered ſaying.</hi> Some old writers of the church, think that this Iames was one of the diſciples, whoſe ſyrname was Iuſtus and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blia, whoſe cruel death is recorded by Ioſephus in the twentieth booke of his antiquities. But would to God the olde writers had trauelled ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to know the man, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſet foorth with feined praiſes the holines
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:7788:193"/> of a man whom they knew not. It is a childiſh toy &amp; ſurmiſe, in that they ſay that it was lawful for him alone to enter into the moſt holy place. For if in that entring in there had bin any religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he had done it contrary to the law of God foraſmuch as he was not the higheſt Prieſt. Secondly, it was a ſuperſtitious thing thus to foſter the ſhadowiſhe worſhippe of the Temple. I omit other trifles. And they are greatly deceiued in that they deny that he was one of the 12. Apoſtles.<note place="margin">Gal. 2.9.</note> For they are enforced to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that it is he whom Paul commendeth ſo honourably, that hee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth him the chiefe among the three pillars of the church. Aſſuredly a man inferiour in order and degree could neuer haue excelled the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles ſo farre. For Paul giueth him the title of an Apoſtle. Neither is that worth the hearing which Hierome bringeth, that the worde is generall there: ſeeing that the dignitie of the order is there handled, for as much as Chriſte did preferre the Apoſtles before other Teachers of the church.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, we may gather out of this place, that they made no ſmall account of Iames: foraſmuch as hee doth with his voice and conſent ſo confirme the wordes of Peter,<note place="margin">Cha. 21.18.</note> that they are all of his minde. And we ſhal ſee afterward how great his authoritie was at Ieruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The olde writers think that this was becauſe he was biſhop of the place, but it is not to be thought that the faithfull did at their pleaſure change the order which Chriſt had appointed, Wherefore I do not doubt but that he was ſonne to Alpheus, &amp; Chriſtes conſin: in which ſenſe hee is alſo called his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Whether he wer biſhop of Ieruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or no, I leaue it indifferent, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doeth it greatly make for the matter, ſaue only becauſe the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie of the pope is hereby refuted, becauſe the decree of the counſell is ſet downe rather at the appointment, and according to the authority of Iames then of Peter. And aſſuredly Euſebius in the beginning of his ſecond book, is not afraid to cal Iames whoſoeuer he wer, the Biſhop of the Apoſtles. Let the men of Rome goe now &amp; boaſt that their Pope is head of the vniuerſall church, becauſe he is Peters ſucceſſour, who ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red another to rule him, if we beleeue Euſebius.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Men and brethren, heare me.</hi> Iames his oration conſiſteth vppon two principall members, For firſt he confirmeth and proueth the calling of the ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiles by the teſtimony of the prophet Amos, ſecondly he ſheweth what is beſt to be don, to nouriſh peace &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cord among the faithfull, yet ſo that the liberty of the gentiles may co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue ſafe &amp; ſound, &amp; that the grace of Chriſt may not be darkned. Whereas Peter is in this place called Simeon, it may be that this name was diuerſly pronounced then. Whereas he ſaith that God did viſit to take a people of the Gentiles, it is referred vnto the mercy of God, whereby hee vouchſafed to receiue ſtrangers into his familie. It is in deed a harſh phraſe, yet ſuch as contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth a profitable doctrine, becauſe hee maketh God the authour of the calling of the Gentiles, and pronounceth that it is through his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that they began to be reckoned among his people, when he ſaith that they were taken by him: but he proceedeth further, when he ſaith that he did viſit that he might take. For this is his meaning, that, at ſuch
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:7788:193"/> time as the Gentiles were turned away from God, hee did mercifully looke vpon them: becauſe we can doe nothing but depart farther and farther from him, vntill ſuch time as his fatherly look preuent vs, of his owne accord.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In his name.</hi> The old interpreter hath, To his name, which is almoſt all one: though the prepoſition <hi>epi</hi> may be otherwiſe tranſlated: to wit: For his name, or vpon his name. Neither ſhal the ſenſe diſagree, that the ſaluation of the Gentiles is grounded in the power or name of god, and that God did reſpect no other thing in calling them, but his own glory: yet did I retaine that which is more vſuall: to wit, that in numbring them among his people, he would haue them counted in his name, like as it ſhalbe ſaid ſhortly after, that his name is called vpon by all thoſe, whom he gathereth together into his church. The aduerbe of time <hi>proton,</hi> may be expounded two wayes: if you read it: firſt, as the old interpreter and Eraſmus haue it, the ſenſe ſhalbe that Cornelius and others, were as it were the firſt frutes, at who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God began the calling of the Gentiles: but it may be taken alſo comparitiuely, becauſe there was already ſome token of the adoption of the Gentiles ſhewed in Cornelius and his coſins be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that Barnabas and Paul preached the goſpel to the Gentiles. And I do better like this latter ſenſe.</p>
               <p n="15">15 <hi>Heereto agree the wordes of the prophets.</hi> Wee ſee now, how the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles tooke nothing to themſelues imperiouſly, but did reuerently fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that which was preſcribed in the word of God. Neither did it greeue them, neither did they count it any diſgrace to them to profeſſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to be the ſcholers of the ſcripture. Alſo wee muſt here note that the vſe of the doctrine of the prophets is yet in force, which ſome brain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke men would baniſh out of the church. By citing the prophets in the plurall number, to be witneſſes, whereas he doth alleage one place only, hee ſignifieth that there is ſuch an agreement among them, that that which is ſpoken by one, is the common teſtimonie of them all, becauſe they ſpeake all with one mouth, and euery one ſpeaketh as in the perſon of all, or rather the ſpirit of God ſpeaketh in them all. Moreouer the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles of all the prophetes were gathered togeather, that they might make one bodie. Wherefore that might worthily and fitly be aſcribed to all the prophets in generall, which was taken out of ſom one part of the generall booke.</p>
               <p n="16">16 <hi>After theſe things I will returne.</hi> Becauſe the place is not cited word for word as it is in the prophet, we muſt ſee what difference there is: thogh it be not neceſſary to examin ſtraitly what diuerſitie there is in the wordes, ſo it appeare that the propheſie doeth fitly agree with the matter which is in hand. After that God hath promiſed the reſtoring of the tabernacle of Dauid, he ſaith alſo, that he will bring to pas, that the Iewes ſhall poſſeſſe the remnants of Edom. In all that text there appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth nothing as yet, whence the calling of the gentiles can be fet or ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered: but that which followeth immediatly after in the prophet, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the remnant of the Gentiles, which ſhall call vpon the name of the Lord, doeth plainly ſhewe that the Iewes &amp; Gentiles ſhall make one
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:7788:194"/> church, becauſe that which was then proper to the Iewes alone, is giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to both in generall. For God placeth the Gentiles in like degree of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor with the Iewes, when he wil haue them to call vpon his name. Thoſe of Idumea and the people there about were in times paſt vnder Dauid, ſubiect to the Iewes, but though they were tributaries to the people of God, yet were they neuertheleſſe ſtrangers from the church. Therefore this was newes &amp; a ſtrange thing, in that God reckoneth them vp with the holy people, that he may be called the God of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al. Seing that it is certaine that they are all made equall in honour among themſelues by this meanes. Whereby it doth plainly appeare how well the teſtimonie of the prophet agreeth with the preſent purpoſe. For God promiſeth to reſtore the decayed Tabernacle, wherein the Gentiles ſhall obey the kingdome of Dauid, not only that they may pay tribute, or take weapon at the kings commaundement: but that they may haue one god, &amp; that they may be one family to him: yet there may a queſtion be moued, why he had rather cite this propheſie, then many other, which contain more plentiful proof of the matter which he hath in hand, of which ſort Paul citeth many.<note place="margin">Rom, 15.9.10.11.</note> I anſwere firſt that the apoſtles wer not ambitious in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping vp places of ſcripture: but they did ſimply ayme at this, which was ſufficient for them: to wit, that they might proue that their doctrine was take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of the word of god, Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly, I ſay that this propheſie of Amos is more plain then it is commonly taken to be. The prophet intreateth of the reſtoring of an houſe which was decayed, he deſcribeth the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ruine thereof. Therefore the promiſe, which is added immediately that the ſeat &amp; throne ſhalbe ſet vppe againe, from of which, kinges of the poſteritie of Dauid ſhal rule ouer the Gentiles, doth properly apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnto Chriſt. Therefore ſo ſone as the kingdome of Chriſt is ſet vp, that muſt needs folow which the prophete ſaith alſo, that the Gentiles ſhal call vpon the name of God. Now we ſee that Iames did not vnadui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly make choiſe of this place. For if the kingdome of Chriſt cannot be otherwiſe eſtabliſhed, vnleſſe god be called vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euery wher throughout the whole world, &amp; the Gentiles grew together to be one with his holy people, it is an abſurd thing that they ſhould be driuen from hope of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, and the midle wall muſt fal to the ground, wherwith the one was ſeparate from the other vnder the law. The firſt word, <hi>I will returne,</hi> is not in the prophet:<note place="margin">Ephe. 2.14.</note> but the change of the ſtate which he denounceth, is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well expreſſed by this meanes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The tabernacle of Dauid which was decayed.</hi> It is not without cauſe that that euill fauoured waſtnes &amp; ruine of the kings houſe is ſet before our eyes by the prophet. For vnleſſe the godly ſhould haue been perſuaded, that Chriſt ſhould notwithſtanding come, though the kingdome of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid were brought to nought, who ſhould not only reſtore to their old or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, thinges whiche were decaied: but ſhoulde exalt euen vnto the heauens the glory of his kingdome with incomparable ſucceſſe, they ſhould haue diſpayred and hundreth times in a day. After they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from the exile wherin they liued at Babylon, they were brought by continuall deſtructions almoſt vnto vtter deſtruction. Afterward that
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:7788:194"/> which remained was conſumed by little &amp; little with ciuill diſcorde, yea when God did releeue their miſeries, that kind of help which they had, was a certain matter of deſpair: for that rule which the Machabees took vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, was then taken away from the tribe of Iuda. For theſe cauſes the Spirite of god doth dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly beat in this by the prophet, that Chriſt ſhall not come, vntil the kingdome of Dauid ſhall periſh: that they may not deſpayr of ſaluation euen amidſt greateſt miſeries.

But if we ſhall come throughly to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the matter, we may eaſily refute ſuch a groſſe mock: becauſe he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone beareth rule hauing depoſed Chriſt. He doth in word confeſſe that he is Chriſts vicar: but in very deed after that he hath by a beautiful ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment ſent Chriſt into the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, he taketh to himſelf al his power. For Chriſt reigneth by the doctrine of his goſpel alone, which is wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly troden vnderfoot by this abominable idol. But let vs remember that this ſhalbe the lawfull eſtate of the church among vs, if we doe all in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall obey Chriſt the king of kings,<note place="margin">Ioh. 10.16,</note> that there may be one ſheepfold &amp; one ſhepheard.</p>

And it is to be thought that Luke did ſummarily co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehend thoſe things wherof Iames did diſpute in his owne language among the Iewes: wherby it came to paſſe that the expoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was mixed with the words of the prophet. In ſteed of the reliques of the Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiles which Amos vſeth, Luke out of the Greek tranſlatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (which was more familiar) putteth the reſt of the men in the ſame ſenſe: to wit, that ther muſt go before the purging of the filthines of the world, a cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, pruning, or paring as it came to paſſe. And this doctrine muſt be alſo applied vnto our time. For becauſe the corruption of the worlde is worſe, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that it can be wholy brought to obey Chriſt, he bloweth away with diuers fannes of tribulations the chaff and weedes, that he may at length gather vnto himſelf that which ſhall remaine.</p>

The anſwere is eaſie, which I will hereafter more at large pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute. Firſt, he requireth nothing at their handes, but that which they were bound to do by brotherly concord: ſecondly, theſe precepts coulde no whit trouble or diſquiet their conſciences, after that they knew that they were free before God, and that falſe and peruers religion was take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away, which the falſe Apoſtles ſought to bring in. The queſtion is now, why Iames doth inioyne the Gentiles theſe foure things alone. Some ſay that this was fet from the auncient cuſtom of the fathers, who did not make any couena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t with any people, which they could inforce to obey the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but vpon this condition. But becauſe there is no fit authour of that thing brought to light, I leaue it in doubt &amp; vndecided.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning things offred to Idols, blood, &amp; that which was ſtrangled.

We know how ſtraitly the Lord co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeth to eſchew thoſe things which are contrary to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall profeſſion of faith, &amp; wherin there is any appearance or ſuſpitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Idolatry. Therfore leaſt there ſhould any blot of ſuperſtitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> remain in the gentiles, &amp; leaſt the Iewes ſhould ſee any thing in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which did not agree with the pure worſhip of god, no maruel if to auoid offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce they be
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:7788:195"/> commaunded to abſtaine from things offered to Idols. The worde <hi>aliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gema</hi> which Luke vſeth doth ſignifie all maner of profanation: therfore I haue not changed the common tranſlation, which hath pollution or filthines. Yet it is ſometime taken for ſacrifices: which ſenſe ſhoulde not diſagree with Iames his purpoſe, &amp; peraduenture it ſhall be more plaine and naturall ſo to expounde it in this place: becauſe where Luke doeth ſhortly after repeat the ſame decree, he will put <hi>Idolothyta,</hi> or thinges ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed to Idols. As concerning blood and that which was ſtrangled not only the Iewes were forbidden by the law of Moſes to eat them:<note place="margin">Deut. 12.23<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Gen. 9.4.</note> but this law was giuen to all the world after the flood, whereby it came to paſſe that thoſe which were not quite growen out of kinde, did loath blood. I do not only ſpeake of the Iewes but of many of the Gentiles. I confes in deed that euen that commandement was but temporal: yet notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it was exte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded farther then vnto one people. No maruell therfore if ther might ariſe greater offence thereupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which to cure ſeemed good to the apoſtles. But there ariſeth a harder queſtion concerning fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: becauſe Iames ſeemeth to reckon the ſame among things indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, whereof they muſt beware only in reſpect of offence. But there was another cauſe for which he placed fornicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> among thoſe things which were not of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues vnlawfull. It is wel knowen what vnbrideled liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to run a whoring did reigne &amp; rage euery where: and this diſeaſe had gotten the vpper hand principally among the men of the Eaſt countrie: as they be more giuen to luſt: aſſuredly the faith and chaſtitie of wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locke was neuer leſſe obſerued and kept any where then among them. Moreouer, hee doeth not intreat indifferently in my iudgement in this place, of all maner fornication or whoredome, as of adulterie and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring and vnbrideled luſts, whereby all chaſtitie is violate and corrupt: but I think he ſpeaketh of concubineſhip as they call it: which was ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon among the Gentiles, that it was almoſt like to a lawe. Therefore whereas Iames reckoneth vp a common corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> among things which are of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues not corrupt, there is therein no inconuenience: ſo that we know that it was not his meaning to place thoſe things in one order which are very far vnlike among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, For wheras vnclean men do thereby colour and cloke their filthineſſe, they may eaſily bee refuted. Iames ſaith, they coupled eating of blood with whoredome: but doth he compare them together as thinges that are like, at leaſt which diſagree not in any point. Yea he doth only reſpect the wicked and corrupt cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of men, which was fallen away from the firſt law and order of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture appointed by God. As concerning the iudgement of god the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thereof muſt be fet out of the continual doctrin of the ſcripture: &amp; it is nothing doutful what the ſcripture ſaith: to wit, that whoredom is accurſed before God, and that the ſoule and body are thereby defiled that the holy temple of God is polluted, &amp; Chriſt is rent in peeces: that God doth dayly puniſh whoremongers, and that he will once pay them home. The filthineſſe of whooredome which the heauenly iudge doth ſo ſore condemne, can be couered with no cloakes by the patrons of whoredome, how wittie and eloquent ſoeuer they be.</p>

For interpreters thinke that Iames added this, becauſe it wer ſuperfluous to preſcribe any thing to the Iewes, who were well acquainted with the doctrine of the lawe, &amp; to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it was read euery Sabboth day: and they picke out this meaning, Let vs be content to require theſe few things at the hands of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, which are not accuſtomed to beare the yoke of the lawe: as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Iewes, they haue Moſes out of whom they may learne more. Some doe alſo gather out of this place, that circumciſion with his appurtenances ought to be obſerued euen at this day among the Iewes. But they reaſon vnfitly and vnskilfully, though that expoſition which I haue ſet downe were true. But Iames had a farre other meaning; to wit, he teacheth that it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be, that ceremonies ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be aboliſhed ſo quickly as it were at the firſt daſh: becauſe the Iewes had now a long time been acquainted with the doctrine of the lawe, and Moſes had his preachers: therefore it ſtood them vpon to redeeme concord for a ſhort time, vntil ſuch time as the libertie gotten by Chriſt, might by little &amp; little appear more plainely: this is that which is ſaid in the common prouerb, that it was meete that the old ceremonies ſhould be buried with ſome honor.

For this maner of ſpeeche is vſed commonly in the ſcripture: to giue the miniſters the ſecond place after that the name of God is once expreſſed. When it is ſaid that the people beleeued God and his ſeruant Moſes, faith is not rent in peeces, as if it did addict it ſelf partly to God &amp; partly to mortall man. What then? to wit, whereas the people had God for the ſole author of their faith, they beleeued or gaue credence to his miniſter from whom he could not be ſeparate. Neither could they otherwiſe beleeue god, then by beleeuing the doctrine ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by Moſes:<note place="margin">Exo. 14.31.</note> as they did ſhake off the yoke of God, after that they had once reiected &amp; deſpiſed Moſes. Wherby the wickednes of thoſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is alſo refuted, who making boaſt of faith with full mouth, do no leſſe wic<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kedly then proudly contemne the miniſterie. For as it wer a ſacrilegious partition, if faith ſhould depend euen but a very little vpon man: ſo thoſe men do openly mock god, who feign that they haue him to be their tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, when they ſet nought by the miniſters by whom he ſpeaketh. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the apoſtles deny that they inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted that decree of their own brain which they deliuer to the Gentiles, but that they wer onely miniſters of the Spirit, that they may with the authoritie of god make them co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable which (proceeding fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him) they do faithfully deliuer. So whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Paul maketh mention of his goſpel, he doth not enforce vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a new go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, which is of his owne inuenting, but hee preacheth that which was committed to him by Chriſte.</p>

But ſuch a vaine cauill is quickly anſwered. For this neceſſitie reached no farther than there was any danger leaſt the vnitie ſhoulde bee cut a ſunder. So that to ſpeake properly, this neceſſitie was accidental or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall: which was placed not in the thing it ſelfe, but onely in auoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the offence, which appeareth more plainely by aboliſhing of the decree. For Lawes made concerning thinges which are of themſelues neceſſarie, muſt be continual. But we know that this Law was foredone by Paul, ſo ſoone as the tumult and contention was once ended,<note place="margin">Rom. 14.14. 1. Cor. 10.25</note> when he teacheth that nothing is vncleane, and when he granteth libertie to eat all manner meates, yea euen ſuch as were ſacrificed to Idols. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in vaine doe they gather any cloake or colour out of this worde, to binde mens conſciences, ſeeing that the neceſſitie ſpoken of in this place, did onely reſpect men in the externall vſe, leaſt there ſhould any offence riſe thereupon: and that their libertie before God might ſtand whole and ſound. Alſo in vaine do they gather out of al the whole place, and in vaine do they go about out of the ſame to proue that the church had power giuen to decree any thing contrary to the word of God. The Pope hath made ſuch lawes as ſeemed beſt to him contrary to the word of God, whereby he meant to gouerne the Church: and that not tenne or twentie, but an infinite number: ſo that they do not onely tyrannouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppreſſe ſoules: but are alſo cruell torments to vex and torment the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. To the ende the hyred brablers of the Pope may excuſe ſuch crueltie, they do obiect that euen the Apoſtles did forbid the Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiles that which was not forbidden in the word of God. But I ſay flatly that the Apoſtles added nothing vnto the word of God. Which ſhall plainely appeare, if we liſt to marke their drift. I ſaid of late that they meant nothing leſſe then to ſet downe a perpetuall law, whereby they might bind the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. What then? They vſe that remedy which was fit for the nouriſhing of brotherly peace and concorde among the Churches: that the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles may for a time applie themſelues to the Iewes. But if we wil grant any thing, we muſt aſſuredly confeſſe that this is according to the word of God, that loue beare the ſway in things indifferent: that is, that the
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:7788:198"/> externall vſe of thoſe things which are of themſelues free, be bent vnto the rule of charitie. In ſumme, if loue be the bonde of perfection and end of the Law, if God commande that wee ſtudie to preſerue mutuall vnity among our ſelues, and that euery man ſerue his neighbour to edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie: no man is ſo ignorant which doeth not ſee that that is contained in the word of God, which the Apoſtles commaunde in this place: onelie they applie a generall rule to their time. Furthermore let vs remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that which I ſaid before, that it was a politike Lawe, which coulde not inſnare the conſcience, neither bring in any feigned worſhippe of God: which two vices the ſcripture condemneth euery where in mens traditions. But admit we ſhould grant (which is moſt falſe) that that did not accorde with the word of God which was decreed in that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell: yet that maketh nothing for the Papiſts. Let the Councels decree any thing contrarie to the expreſſe worde of God, according to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation of the Spirite: Yet none but lawfull Councels may haue this authoritie giuen them. Then let them prooue that their Councels were godlie and holie, to the decrees whereof they will haue vs ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect. But I will not any farther proſecute this point, becauſe it was handled in the beginning of the Chapter. Let the readers know (which is ſufficient for this preſent place) that the Apoſtles paſſe not the boundes of the worde of God, when they ſet downe an externall Lawe as time requireth, whereby they may reconcile the Churches among themſelues.</p>

Notwithſtanding becauſe it belongeth to all alike to know for a ſuertie what they muſt hold, the godly and learned teachers muſt make known to the whole Church, what they haue ſet downe out of the worde of God. For there is nothing more vnfitting for holie and Chriſtian order, than to driue away the bodie of the people from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon doctrin as if it were a heerd of ſwine: as they vſe to do vnder the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie of popery.

But we muſt note, that there was no ſmall matter of conſolation therein, becauſe when they knewe the conſent of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, they were all pacified, and alſo whereas before there was variance among them, they are now reconciled one to another. Seing there went a falſe report about, that all the Apoſtles were againſt Paul and Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas, this ſame had ſhaken ſome who were too light of beliefe: manie did ſtand in doubt: the wicked abuſed this occaſion to ſpeak euil: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome were pricked forward with loue of noualty and with curioſitie, and one was ſet againſt another. But now after that they ſee that the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the firſt Church doth agree with the doctrine of Paul and Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas, they obtaine that for which the children of God ought moſt to wiſh, that being eſtabliſhed in the right faith, and being of one mind a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelues, they may with quiet mindes haue peace one with another.</p>
               <p n="32">32 <hi>Iudas and Silas.</hi> Theſe two brethren were ſent for this cauſe, that they might alſo teſtifie the ſame thing by word which was contained in the letters, and more alſo. Otherwiſe the Apoſtles woulde not haue ſent ſuch ſhort letters concerning ſo great and weightie a matter: and they would haue alſo ſpoken ſomewhat touching the myſteries of faith, and would haue made ſome long exhortation, wherein they would haue perſwaded them vnto the ſtudie of godlineſſe. Nowe Luke ſheweth ſome farther thing by them done: to wit, that being furniſhed with the gift of Prophecie, they edifie the Church in generall, as if he ſhoulde ſay, they did not onely doe their duetie faithfullie in the cauſe which was nowe in hande: but they did alſo take good and profitable paines in teaching and exhorting the Church. And we muſt note that he ſaith that they exhorted the Church becauſe they were Prophetes: for it is not a thing common to all men to enter ſuch an excellent function. Therefore we muſt beware leaſt any man paſſe his bounds: as Paul tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth 1. Cor. 7. and Epheſians 4.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 7.20. Epheſ. 4.1.</note> that euery one keepe himſelfe within the meaſure of grace receiued. Wherefore it is not in vaine that Luke ſaith that the office of teaching is peculiar: leaſt any man through am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition being voide of habilitie, or through raſh zeale, or through anie other fooliſh deſire coueting to put out his heade, trouble the order of the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They were Prophets.</hi> Whereas the worde hath diuerſe ſignifications, it is not taken in this place for thoſe prophets to whom it was graunted to foretell things to come: becauſe this title ſhould come in out of ſeaſon
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:7788:199"/> when hee intreateth of another matter: but Luke his meaning is that Iudas and Silas were indued with excellent knowledge and vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the myſteries of God, that they might be good interpreters of God: as Paul in the forteenth of the firſt to the Corinthians, when he intreateth of the prophecie,<note place="margin">1.

               <p n="33">33 <hi>They were let goe in peace.</hi> That is, when they departed, the brethren in taking their leaue of them, did wiſh them well, as friends vſe to doe. And there is Synecdoche in this member: becauſe the one of the two did onely returne to Ieruſalem. And in the text there is a correction ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded immediatly, that it ſeemed good to Silas to tarrie there: but when Luke ioyneth them both togither, his meaning is onely to declare that the Church was quiet before they thought vppon any returning. At length he addeth that Paul and Barnabas ſo long as they were at Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och gaue themſelues to teaching, and did continue in this work: and yet did they giue place to many mo. Whereby it appeareth that they had al one &amp; the ſame deſire without grudging, ſo that they ioined ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in hand to doe good. Though it ſeemeth that he maketh mention of many moe of ſet purpoſe, leaſt we ſhould thinke that after that Paul and Barnabas were departed, that Church was deſtitute, which did floriſh in aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of teachers.

               <p n="36">36 <hi>Let vs viſit our brethren.</hi> In this hiſtorie we muſt firſt note how care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Paul was for the Churches which he had ordained. Hee laboureth in deed at Antiochia profitablie: but becauſe hee remembred that hee was an Apoſtle ordained of God, and not the paſtour of one particular place, hee keepeth the courſe of his calling. Secondly, as it did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come him to be tied to one place, ſo he thinketh with himſelfe that he
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:7788:199"/> was bound to all whom he begat in the Lord: therefore he will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them to want his helpe. Moreouer the worke that was begunne in thoſe places could not be neglected, but it woulde ſhortly after decay. Yet it is to be thought that Paul ſtayed ſtil in the Church of Antiochia, vntill he ſaw the eſtate thereof well ordered, and concord eſtabliſhed. For we knowe and trie what great force principall Churches haue to keepe other leſſer Churches in order. If there ariſe any tumult in an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure ſtreete, or if there fal out any offence, the rumour goeth not ſo far, neither are the neighbours ſo much mooued. But if any place be excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, it cannot quaile without great ruine: or at leaſt but that the leſſer buildings ſhalbe therewith ſore ſhaken both far and wide. Therefore Paul in ſtaying a time at Antioch did prouide for other Churches: and ſo we muſt no leſſe looke vnto his wiſdome than his diligence in this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample: becauſe oftentimes the immoderate heat of the Paſtours in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about matters, doeth no leſſe hurt than their ſluggiſhnes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How they doe.</hi> Paul knewe that amidſt ſo great lightneſſe and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie of men, and as their nature is inclined to vice, if there be any thing well ordered among them it doeth ſeldome continue ſtable &amp; for any long time: and eſpecially that Churches doe eaſily decay or growe out of kind vnleſſe they be looked too continually. There ought nothing vnder heauen to bee more firme, than the ſpirituall building of faith, whoſe ſtabilitie is grounded in the very heauen, yet there be but fewe in whoſe mindes the worde of the Lorde doth throughly take liuely roote: therefore firmnes is rare in men. Againe, euen thoſe who haue their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor firmely fixed in the trueth of God, doe not ceaſe notwithſtanding to be ſubiect to diuerſe toſſings: wherby though their faith be not ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned yet hath it neede of ſtrengthning that it may be vnderpropped and ſtayed. Moreouer we ſee how ſathan doeth aſſault, and with what ſubtile ſhiftes hee goeth about priuily to pull downe ſometimes whole Churches, ſometimes euery one of the faithfull particularly. Therefore it is not without cauſe that Paul is ſo carefull for his ſcholars, leaſt they behaue themſelues otherwiſe, then is to be wiſhed: and therefore is hee deſirous in time to preuent, if there be any inconuenience riſen: which cannot be vntill he haue taken view.</p>
               <p n="37">37 <hi>And Barnabas gaue counſell.</hi> Luke doth here ſet downe that doleful diſagreement, which ought to make all the godly afraid for iuſt cauſes. The ſocietie of Paul and Barnabas was conſecrated by the heauenly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle. They had long time laboured being of one mind, vnder this yoke whereunto the Lord had tied them: they had by many e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>eriences tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the excellent fauour of God. Yea that wonderful ſucceſſe mentioned heretofore by Luke, was a manifeſt bleſſing of God. Though they had bin almoſt drowned ſo often in ſo many tempeſtes of perſecution, and were ſet vpon ſo ſore by infinite enimies: though domeſticall ſedition were euery where kindled againſt them, yet they were ſo farre from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pulled in ſunder, that their agreement was then moſt of al tried. But now for a light matter, and which might eaſily haue bin ended, they breake that holy bond of Gods calling. This could not fall out without
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:7788:200"/> great perturbance to al the godly. Seing that the heat of the contention was ſo great and vehement in theſe holy men, who had long time accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed themſelues to ſuffer all things: what ſhall befall vs, whoſe affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions being not as yet ſo brought to obey God, do oftentimes rage with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out modeſtie? Seing that a light occaſion did ſeperate them, who had long time amidſt ſo great trials retained vnity holily, how eaſily may ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan cauſe thoſe to be diuided, who haue either none or at leaſt a colde deſire to foſter peace? What great pride was it for Barnabas, who had no more honorable thing than to be Paul his companion, that he might behaue himſelfe like a ſonne toward his father, ſo ſtubbernely to refuſe his counſell? Peraduenture alſo ſome might thinke that Paul was not very courteous in that hee did not forgiue a faithfull helper this fault. Therefore we be admoniſhed by this example, that vnleſſe the ſeruants of Chriſt take great heed, there be many chinkes through which Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan will creepe in, to diſturbe that concorde which is among them. But nowe we muſt examine the cauſe it ſelfe. For ſome there bee who lay the blame of the diſagreement vppon Paule: and at the firſt hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, the reaſons which they bring ſeeme probable. Iohn Marke is reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, becauſe he withdrew himſelfe from Pauls companie: but hee fell not away from Chriſt. A yong man being as yet vnacquainted with bearing the croſſe, returned home from his iorney. He was ſomewhat to be born with for his age: being a freſhwater ſoldiar he fainted in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles euen at the firſt daſh: he was not therefore about to bee a ſlothfull ſoldiar during his whole life. Now foraſmuch as his returning to Paul is an excellent teſtimony of repentance, it ſeemeth to be a point of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courteſie to reiect him. For thoſe muſt bee handled more courteouſly, who puniſh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues for their owne offences of their own accord. There were alſo other cauſes which ought to haue made Paul more courteous. The houſe of Iohn Mark was a famous Inne:<note place="margin">Sup. 12.12.</note> his mother had intertained the faithful in moſt greeuous perſecution: when Herod &amp; al the people were in a rage, they were wont to haue their ſecreat meetings there: as Luke reported before. Surely he ought to haue borne with ſuch a holy &amp; couragious woman, leaſt immoderate rigor ſhould alienate her: ſhe was deſirous to haue her ſon addicted to preach the goſpel, now what a great griefe might it haue bin to her, that his pains &amp; induſtry ſhould be refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for one light fault? &amp; now wheras Iohn Mark doth not only bewayle his fault, but in very deed amend the ſame: Barnabas hath a faire colour why he ſhould pardon him. Yet we may gather out of the text, that the Church did allow Pauls counſel. For Barnabas departeth and with his companion hee ſaileth into Cyprus. There is no mention made of the brethren: as if he had departed priuily without taking his leaue. But the Brethren commend Paul in their prayers to the grace of God: whereby appeareth thar the Church ſtoode on his ſide. Secondly whereas God ſhoweth forth the power of his Spirit in bleſſing Paul, &amp; doth bleſſe his labours with happy ſucceſſe of his grace, &amp; leaueth Barnabas as it were buried, there may a probable reaſon bee drawne thence, that it pleaſed him that ſuch an example of ſeueritie ſhould be ſhewed. And ſurely the
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:7788:200"/> offence of Ihon Mark was greater then it is commonly taken for. He ſlid not backe in deed from the faith of Chriſt: yet did he forſake his calling, and was a reuolt from the ſame: therefore it was a matter which might haue giuen euill example, if he had bin ſtreightway receiued again into the calling, from which he was ſlid backe. He had giuen himſelfe ouer to ſerue Chriſt vpon this condition, that he ſhould be free no longer. It was no more lawfull for him to break his promiſe made in this behalfe, than it is for a husbande to leaue his wife, or for a ſon to forſake his father. Neither doth infirmitie excuſe his vnfaithfulnes, whereby the holineſſe of the calling was violate. And we muſt note that he was not altogither reiected of Paul: he counted him as a brother, ſo he woulde be content with the common order: he refuſed to admit him vnto the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of teaching: from whence he fell filthily through his owne fault. And there is no great difference betweene theſe two, whether he which hath offended be quite excluded from pardon: or he haue onely publike honor denied him: though it may be that they did both exceed meaſure, as accidents do oftentimes mar a matter which is otherwiſe good. It was wel done of Paul &amp; according to the right of diſcipline profitably, not to admit him to be his companion, whoſe inconſtancy he had once tried: but when he ſaw Barnabas ſo importunate, he might haue yeelded to his deſire. We ought to make more account of the truth than of the fauor of all the whol world: but it is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient that we ponder wiſely, what great weight there is in the matter which is in hande. For if in a matter of no weight or edification a man vant of his conſtancie, prepare himſelfe for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>flict, &amp; ceaſe not to defend that vntil the end, wherin he did once take delight: it ſhalbe but fooliſh &amp; peruerſe obſtinacie. There was alſo ſome midle way &amp; meanes whereby Paul might haue granted ſomwhat to the importunatneſſe of his fellow in office: and yet haue not reuolted from the trueth. It was not for him to flatter Mark, or to cloake his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence: yet was he not letted by religion but that after he had freely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed what he thought, he might ſuffer himſelf to be ouercome in that matter, which did neither indamage true doctrin, nor indanger mans ſal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uation: which I ſay for this cauſe, that we may learne to moderate our deſire euen in the beſt cauſes, leaſt it paſſe meaſure and be too feruent.</p>

Tim. 1.18.</note> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned by the ſpirit, as Paul doth teſtifie elſewhere. But there ſeemeth to be ſome diſagreement in that,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 3.7.</note> in that Luke ſaith that Timotheus was well reported off amongſt the brethren: and Paul will haue him to haue a good report of thoſe who are without, who is choſen to be a Biſhoppe. I anſwere, that wee muſt principally looke vnto the iudgement of the godly: as they be ſole meete witneſſes, and doe alone rightly diſcerne well and wiſely according to the Spirite of God: and that we ought to attribute no more to the wicked than to blind men. Therefore it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that godlines and holines of life muſt bee iudged according to the will and conſent of godly men: that he bee counted worthie to be a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, whom they commend. Notwithſtanding I confeſſe that euen this alſo is required in the ſeconde place, that the verie infidels be enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to commend him: leaſt the Church of God come in danger of their ſlanders and euill ſpeaking, if it committe it ſelfe to bee gouerned by men of euill report.</p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>He Circumciſed him becauſe of the Iewes.</hi> Luke doth plainely expreſſe that Timothie was not circumciſed, becauſe it was neceſſarie it ſhould be ſo: or becauſe the religion of that ſigne did continue as yet: but that Paul might auoid an offence. Therefore there was reſpect had of men, whereas the matter was free before God. Wherefore the circumciſing of Timotheus was no ſacrament, as was that which was giuen to Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham and his poſterie: but an indifferent Ceremonie, which ſerued on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for nouriſhing of loue, and not for any exerciſe of godlineſſe. Nowe the queſtion is,<note place="margin">Gen. 17.13.</note> whether it were lawfull for Paule to vſe a vaine ſigne, whoſe ſignification and force was aboliſhed: for it ſeemeth a vain thing when there is a departure made from the inſtitution of God. But Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion was commaunded by God to continue onely vntill the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Chriſt. To this queſtion I aunſwere, that Circumciſion did ſo ceaſe at the comming of Chriſt, that notwithſtanding the vſe thereof was not quite aboliſhed by and by: but it continued free, vntill all men might know that Chriſt was the end of the Law, by the more manifeſt reuelation of the light of the Goſpel. And here we muſt note three de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees. The firſt is, that the ceremonies of the Law were ſo aboliſhed by the comming of Chriſt, that they did neither any longer appertain vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the worſhip of God, neither were they figures of ſpiritual things, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was there any neceſſitie to vſe them. The ſeconde is, that the vſe thereof was free, vntill the truth of the Goſpel might more plainely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare.
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:7788:201"/> The third, that it was not lawful for the faithful to retaine them, ſaue onely ſo farre forth as the vſe thereof ſerued, for edification, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was there any ſuperſtition therby foſtered. Though that free power to vſe them, whereof I haue ſpoken, be not without exception: becauſe there was a diuerſe reſpect to be had of ceremonies. For circumciſion was not in the ſame place, wherein the ſacrifices were, which were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained for the purging of ſins. Wherfore it was lawful for Paul to circum<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ciſe Timotheus: it had not bin lawfull for him to offer a ſacrifice for ſin. This is in deed a general thing that all the worſhip of the Law, did ceaſe at the comming of Chriſt, (becauſe it was to continue but for a time) as touching faith and conſcience: but concerning the vſe wee muſt knowe this, that it is indifferent and left in the libertie of the godly for a ſhort time: ſo far as it was not contrary to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſion of faith. We muſt note the ſhortnes of time whereof I ſpeak, to wit vntill the plaine manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Goſpel: becauſe ſome learned men are groſſely deceiued in this point, who think that circumciſion doeth yet take place among the Iewes: whereas Paul teacheth that it is ſuperfluous when we are buried with Chriſt by baptiſme. It was better and more truly ſaid in the old pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe, that The ſynagogue was to be buried with honour.<note place="margin">Coll. 2.11.12.</note> Now it reſteth that we declare how farre forth the vſe of circumciſion was indifferent. That ſhall eaſily appeare by the manner of the libertie. Becauſe the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Gentiles was not as yet generally knowen,<note place="margin">Galat. 2.3.</note> it was meete that the Iewes ſhould haue ſome prerogatiue granted them. Therefore vntill it might be better knowen that the adoption was deducted from the ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage &amp; kinred of Abraham vnto all the Gentiles: it was lawfull ſo far as edification did require, to retaine the ſigne of difference. For ſeing that Paul would not circumciſe Titus, and doeth auouch that the ſame was wel done, it followeth that it was not lawful to vſe this ceremony alwaies and without choiſe. Therefore they were to haue reſpect vnto edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and vnto the publike commoditie of the Church. Becauſe he could not circumciſe Titus, vnleſſe he would betraie the doctrine of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and lay himſelfe open to the ſlaunders of the aduerſaries: he ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained from the free vſe of the Ceremonie, which he did vſe in Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus, when he ſawe that it was profitable for the Church. Hereby it doth eaſily appeare what horrible confuſion doth reign in popery. There is there an huge heape of Ceremonies, and to what end, but that they may haue in ſteede of one veile of the old temple an hundred: God did abrogate thoſe ceremonies which he had commanded, that the trueth of the Goſpel might ſhine more clearely: men durſt take vpon them to bring in new, and that without keeping any meaſure. After this came in a wicked ſurmiſe, that all theſe ſerue for the worſhip of God: at length followed the diuelliſh confidence of Merit. Now, foraſmuch as it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ynough that ſuch Ceremonies are neither veyles nor ſepulchres wherewith Chriſt is couered: but rather ſtinking dunghils wherein faith and religion are chocked: thoſe who make the vſe thereof gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally free, doe aſcribe more to the Pope, than the Lord graunteth to his Law. It is to no end to ſpeake of the Maſſe and of ſuch filthineſſe which
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:7788:202"/> containe in themſelues manifeſt idolatrie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They all knew this.</hi> Luke telleth vs that this was Pauls drift, to make an entraunce for Timotheus vnto the Iewes, leaſt they ſhould abhorre him as a prophane man. They knew all (ſaith hee) that his father was a Grecian. Therefore becauſe the mothers had no power ouer their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, they were fully perſwaded that he was vncircumciſed. Let the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders note here by the way, how miſerable the bondage of the people of God was then. Eunicha mother to Timotheus was one of the ſmal rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunt, which the very Iewes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues counted a monſter: &amp; yet beyng married to a man which was an Infidel, ſhe durſt not conſecrate her children to God: no ſhe durſt not ſo much as giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the external ſigne of grace: and yet ſhe ceaſed not therfore to inſtruct her ſonne of a child holily in the feare of God: and in his true worſhippe. An example ſurely worthy to be folowed of wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their huſbands affray with their ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannous gouernment, from keeping and training vp their children and families chaſtly in true godlines. Grecian is taken in this place for a ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, after the olde and common cuſtome of the ſcripture.</p>
               <p n="4">4 <hi>They deliuered them the decrees to keepe.</hi> In theſe wordes Luke doeth ſignifie vnto vs howe deſirous Paul was of peace. The beſt and ſtrongeſt bond to keepe and foſter peace among the churches, was to keepe that which was ſet downe by the Apoſtles. When Paul taketh great pains a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that, he taketh greate heede leaſt through his fault there ariſe any trouble. And let vs remember that that continued but for a time: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſo ſoone as he ſeeth the daunger of offence ceaſe, hee doeth quite vnburthen the churches, and ſetting apart the decree, he maketh that free which the Apoſtles had there forbidden. And yet doth not he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel or violate by that abrogation that which the Apoſtles had decreed, or contemn the authors themſelues: becauſe they were not determined to eſtabliſh a perpetuall law: but onely to mitigate for a ſhort time that which might hurt weake conſciences: as I did more at large declare in the former chapter: whereby the folly of the papiſts is ſufficiently refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, who doe grieuouſly lay to our charge that we be farre vnlike Paule: becauſe we wil haue the conſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of the godlie gouerned by the word of God alone, ſetting light by the decrees of the church, as they cal the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and not to be ſubiect to the wil of men. But as I haue alreadie ſaid, Paul meant nothing leſſe, then to inſnare mens conſciences in the ſnare of neceſſitie, for he is not contrary to himſelf, when he crieth in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,<note place="margin">Tit. 1.15.</note> that all thinges are cleane to the cleane. And againe, Hee which is cleane eateth all thinges. And againe, The kingdom of God is not meat and drinke.<note place="margin">Rom. 14.2.17.</note> And againe, Meate doth not commend vs to God.

Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we attempt nothing at this day which is contrary to, or diſagreeing with Paul. But the papiſtes mocke vs too groſlie when they compare
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:7788:202"/> their lawes with the decrees of the Apoſtles. The Apoſtles inuented no new worſhip of God, they had erected no newe ſpiritual gouernement: but for the deſire they had to mainteine peace they exhorted the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, that they wold yeeld a little to the Iewes.

                  </gap> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe his lawes vnder this colour, he muſt firſt change them wholly. And as for vs, ſeeing that the papiſtes doe place the ſpiritual worſhip of God in mans inuentions, and tranſlate the right which belongeth to God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone vnto men, that they may reigne as Lords ouer ſoules: we are infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced manfully to withſtand them, vnleſſe through trecherous ſilence, we wil betray the grace gotten by the blood of Chriſt. Now what likelihood can there be betweene three decrees ſet downe for the helpe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of the weake, and an infinite heape of lawes: which doth not onlie oppreſſe miſerable ſoules with the weight thereof, but alſo ſwallowe vp faith? We know the complaint of Auguſtine writing to Ianuarius: that the Church was wickedly laden euen then with too greate a burden of traditions. Could he, I pray you ſuffer the bondage of theſe times, which is almoſt an hundreth times harder and heauier.</p>
               <p n="5">5 <hi>The Churches were confirmed.</hi> By this we gather, that that which Luke ſetteth down, or rather toucheth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the decrees of the apoſtles, was as it were put in by the way, being not much appertinent vnto the matter. For he commendeth a farre other fruit of Pauls doctrine, when he ſaith that the churches were confirmed in the faith. Therfore Paule did ſo order external things, that he was principally careful for the king<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dome of God, which conſiſteth in the doctrine of the goſpel, and doth farre ſurpaſſe and ſurmount externall order. Therefore thoſe decrees were mentioned, in as much as they were expedient for mainteining concord, that we might know that the holy man had a care thereof. But religion and godlines hath the former place, whoſe ſole foundation is faith: which againe doth ſtay it ſelfe vpon the pure worde of God, and doth not depend vpon mens lawes. Now by this example Luke pricketh vs forward to proceed co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually: leaſt at the beginning ſloth or neglect of profiting come vpon vs. Alſo the way to increaſe faith is expreſſed, to wit when the Lord doth ſtirre vs vp by the induſtry of his ſeruants: as at that time he vſed the labour and dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of Paul and his companions. When he addeth immediatly that they were alſo increaſed in number: he commendeth another fruit of preaching: and yet he doth therwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſignifie vnto vs, that the more thoſe profite in faith, who are firſt cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, the more doe they bring vnto Chriſt: as if faith did creepe abroade vnto others by branches.</p>

               </q>
               <p n="6">6 <hi>When they had gone throughout.</hi> Luke ſheweth here how diligent &amp; carefull Paul and his companions were in the office of teaching: for hee ſaith that they iorneyed through diuerſe regions of the leſſer Aſia, that they might preach the goſpel. But he reciteth one thing which is worth the remembring, that they were forbidden by the Spirite of God to ſpeake of Chriſt in ſome places, which ſerueth not a little to ſet foorth the Apoſtleſhip of Paul: as vndoubtedly he was not a little incouraged to proceed, when hee knewe that the Spirite of God was his guide in his way, and the gouernour of his actions. And whereas whither ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they came they prepared themſelues to teach, they did that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their calling, and according to the commaundement of God. For they were ſent to preach and publiſh the Goſpell to the Gentiles without exception: but the Lorde reuealed his counſell in gouerning the courſe of their iorney, which was before vnknowne, euen in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Notwithſtanding the queſtion is, If Paul taught no where but whither hee was ledde by the Spirite, what certainetie ſhall the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Church haue at this day of their calling, who are certified by no Oracles when they muſt ſpeake or holde their peace? I anſwere, Seeing that Pauls prouince and charge was ſo wide, he had neede of the ſingular direction of the Spirite. Hee was not made the Apoſtle of one particular place, or of a fewe Cities: but hee had receiued com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement to preach the Goſpel through Aſia, and Europa: which was to ſaile in a moſt wide ſea. Wherefore there is no cauſe why wee ſhoulde woonder that in that confuſed wideneſſe God beckened vnto him as it were by reaching foorth his hand, how far he would haue him goe, or whither.</p>
               <p>But heere ariſeth an other harder queſtion, why the Lorde did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid Paul to ſpeake in Aſia, and ſuffered him not to come into Bithynia. For if aunſwere bee made that theſe Gentiles were vnworthie of the doctrine of ſaluation; we may againe demaunde why Macedonia was more worthie. Thoſe who deſire to bee too wiſe, doe aſſigne the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of this difference in men: that the Lorde vouchſafeth euerie man of his Goſpel, as hee ſeeth him bent vnto the obedience of faith: but hee himſelfe ſaieth farre otherwiſe, to wit, that hee appeared plainely to thoſe which ſought him not, and that hee ſpake to thoſe who asked not of him. For whence commeth aptneſſe to be taught and a mind to obey, but from his Spirite? therefore it is certaine that ſome are not preferred before otherſome by their merit, ſeeing that all men are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turallie like backward and waiwarde from faith. Therefore there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing better than to leaue free power to God to vouchſafe and depriue of his grace whom he will. And ſurely as his eternall election is free, ſo his calling is alſo free which floweth thence: and is not grounded in men, ſeeing that he is not indebted to any.</p>
               <pb n="389" facs="tcp:7788:203" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>Wherefore let vs knowe that the Goſpel ſpringeth and iſſueth out to vs out of the ſole fountaine of meere grace. And yet God doeth not want a iuſt reaſon, why he offereth his Goſpel to ſome, and paſſeth ouer otherſome: But, I ſay, that that reaſon lieth hid in his ſecreat counſell. In the meane ſeaſon let the faithfull know, that they were called freely, when other were ſet aſide: leaſt they take that to themſelues which is due to the mercy of God alone. And in the reſt whom God reiecteth for no manifeſt cauſe, let them learne to wonder at the deepe depth of his iudgement, which they may not ſeeke out. And here the word Aſia is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for that part which is properly ſo called. When Luke ſaieth that Paul and his companions aſſaied to come into Bithynia, vntil they were forbidden of the ſpirit: he ſheweth that they were not directed by Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, ſaue onely when neede required, as the Lorde vſeth to be preſent with his in dolefull and vncertaine matters.</p>
               <p n="9">9 <hi>A viſion by night.</hi> The Lorde would not that Paul ſhould ſtay any longer in Aſia: becauſe he would draw him into Macedonia. And Luke expreſſeth the maner of the drawing, that a man of Macedonia appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to him by night. Where we muſt note that the Lord did not alwayes obſerue the ſame manner of reuelation: becauſe diuerſe kinds are more conuenient for confirmation. And it is not ſaid that this viſion was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in a dreame: but onely in the night ſeaſon. For there be certaine night viſions, which men ſee when they be awake.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Helpe vs.</hi> This ſpeech ſetteth forth the miniſterie committed to Paul. For ſeing that the Goſpel is the power of God to ſaluation, thoſe which are the miniſters of God are ſaid to helpe thoſe who periſh: that hauing deliuered them from death, they may bring them vnto the inheritance of eternall life.<note place="margin">Rom. 1.16.</note> And this ought to be no ſmall incouragement for godly teachers to ſtirre vp the heat of their ſtudie and deſire: when they heare that they call backe miſerable ſoules from deſtruction, and that they helpe thoſe who ſhoulde otherwiſe periſh, that they may bee ſaued. Againe, all people vnto whom the Goſpel is brought, are taught reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently to embrace the miniſters thereof as deliuerers: vnleſſe they will maliciouſly reiect the grace of God: and yet this commendation and title is not ſo tranſlated vnto men, that God is robbed euen of the leaſt parte of his praiſe: becauſe though hee by his miniſters giue ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet is he the onely author thereof, as if he reached out his hands to helpe.</p>
               <p n="10">10 <hi>Being fullie perſwaded.</hi> Hence we gather that it was no bare viſion but that it was alſo confirmed by the teſtimony of the Spirit. For Satan doeth oftentimes abuſe ghoſts and viſures to deceiue with all, that hee may mocke and coſin the vnbeleeuers. Whereby it commeth to paſſe that the bare viſion leaueth mans minde in doubt: but ſuch as are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine in deede, thoſe doeth the Spirit ſeale by a certaine marke: that thoſe may not doubt nor wauer, whom the Lord will haue certainly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to himſelfe, A wicked Spirit appeared to Brutus, inuiting him to enter that vnhappie cumbate and battle which he had at Philippi, euen in the verie ſame place whereunto Paul was afterward called. But as
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:7788:204"/> the cauſe was farre vnlike: ſo the Lorde dealt farre otherwiſe with his ſeruant, ſo that he put him out of doubt: and left him not aſtonied with feare. Nowe in Paul and his companions the deſire to obey inſued im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly vpon the certaintie: for ſo ſoone as they vnderſtand that the Lord called them, they addreſſe themſelues to their iorney. The termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the participle which is here vſed is actiue: and though it haue diuerſe ſignifications, I do not doubt but that Luke his meaning is, that Paul and the reſt, after that they had conferred this viſion with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Oracles, were fully perſwaded that the Lord had called them into Macedonia.</p>

Yea euen there they cannot haue one man which will harken to their doctrine, they can onely haue one woman to be a diſciple of Chriſt: and that one which was an aliant. Who would not haue ſaide that this iorney was taken in hand fooliſhly, which fel out ſo vnhappily? But the Lorde doeth thus bring to paſſe his works vnder a baſe &amp; weak kind: that his power may ſhine more clearly at length, and it was moſt meet that the beginnings of the kingdome of Chriſt ſhould be ſo ordered, that they might taſt of the humilitie of the croſſe. But we muſt mark the conſtancy of Paul &amp; his companions, who
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:7788:204" rendition="simple:additions"/> being not diſmaid with ſuch vnproſperous beginnings, trie whither any occaſion will offer it ſelfe contrary to their expectation.

                  </gap>uite of their labour, for there is no cauſe why they ſhould deſire to be more happie than Paul. When Luke ſaith that they abode in that Citie, ſome had rather haue it, that they conferred or diſputed, but the other tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation is more plaine, &amp; the text perſwadeth vs to make choiſe thereof: becauſe Luke wil ſhortly after declare, that Lydia was the firſt fruites of that Church, and we may eaſily geſſe, that the Apoſtles went out of the Citie, becauſe there was no gate opened to them in it.</p>
               <p n="13">13 <hi>In the day of the Sabaoths.</hi> No doubt the Iewes ſought ſome place which was ſolitarie and by the way, when they were diſpoſed to pray be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their religion was then euery where moſt odious. And God by their example meant to teach vs, what great account we ought to make of the profeſſion of faith: that wee doe not forſake it either for feare of enuie or of daunger. They had in deede in many places Synagogues: but it was not lawfull for them to aſſemble themſelues publikely at Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippi which was a free Citie of Rome. Therefore they withdraw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues into a ſecreat corner, that they may pray to god where they could not be eſpied: and yet there were thoſe who did grudge euen at this, ſo that they might think that it might both cauſe trouble and danger, but they prefer the worſhip of God before their own quietnes &amp; commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Furthermore we may gather by this worde Sabaoth, that Luke ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of the Iewes. Secondly foraſmuch as he commendeth the godlines of Lydia, it muſt needs be that ſhe was a Ieweſſe: which matter needeth no long diſputation, foraſmuch as we know that it was an hainous offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce for the grecians &amp; Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to celebrate the Sabaoth, or to take vp Iewiſh rites. Now we vnderſtand that the Iewes made choiſe of the riuers bank that they might there pray, not for any ſuperſtitions ſake, but becauſe they ſhunned the company of men, &amp; the ſight of the people. If any man obiect, why did not euery man pray in his houſe priuatly. The anſwere is ready, that This was a ſolemn rite of praying to teſtifie godlines: &amp; that being far from the ſuperſtitions of the Gentiles, they might one exhort another to worſhip God alone, &amp; that they might noriſh the religion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued of the fathers among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues. As touching Paul &amp; his fellowes who were lately come, it is to be thought that they came thither not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to pray, but alſo becauſe they hoped to do ſome good. For it was a fit place for them to teach in, being far from noiſe: &amp; it was meet that they ſhould be more attentiue to heare the word who came thither to pray. Luke putteth the day of the ſabaoths, in ſteed of the ſabaoth: where fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Eraſmus I haue tranſlated it, There was wont to be praier: the old interpreter hath, did ſeeme. And the word <hi>nomizesthai</hi> hath both ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications among the Grecians. Yet this ſenſe is more fit for this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent place, that they did commonly vſe to haue prayer there.</p>

                  <hi>We ſpake to the women.</hi> Either that place was appointed for the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of women: or elſe religion was cold among men, ſo that they came
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:7788:205" rendition="simple:additions"/> more ſlowly. Howſoeuer it be, we ſee that the holy men omit no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or opportunitie: becauſe they vouchſafe to offer the Goſpel euen to women alone. Furthermore foraſmuch as it ſeemeth likely to me, that men and women made their praiers there togither, I ſuppoſe that Luke omitted the men, either becauſe they would not heare, or elſe becauſe they profited nothing by hearing.</p>
               <p n="14">14 <hi>A woman named Lidia.</hi> If they had bin heard of a fewe women, yet this had beene but to enter in as it were by a ſtraite chinke. But nowe whereas one only heareth attentiuely and with fruit, might it not haue ſeemed that the way was ſtopt before Chriſt? But afterwarde there ſprunge a noble Church of that one ſmall graffe, which Paul ſetteth out with many excellent commendations: yet it may be that Lydia had ſome companions, whereof there is no mention made, becauſe ſhee did farre excell them all. And Luke doth not aſſigne that for the cauſe why this one woman did ſhew her ſelfe apt to bee taught, becauſe ſhee was more wittie than the reſt, or becauſe ſhe had ſome preparation of her ſelfe: but he ſaith that the Lorde opened her heart that ſhe might giue eare and take heede to the ſpeech of Paul. He had of late commended her godlineſſe: and yet he ſheweth that ſhe could not comprehend the doctrine of the Goſpel, ſaue onely through the illumination of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite. Wherefore we ſee that not faith alone, but all vnderſtanding and knowledge of ſpirituall thinges is the peculiar gift of God, and that the miniſters do no good by teaching and ſpeaking, vnleſſe the inward cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of God be thereunto added. By the word heart, the Scripture mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth ſometimes the minde, as when Moſes ſaieth, God hath not giuen thee hitherto a heart to vnderſtand. So likewiſe in this place Luke doth not onely ſignifie vnto vs that Lydia was brought by the inſpiration of the Spirit, with affection of heart to embrace the Goſpel: but that her minde was lightned, that ſhe might vnderſtand it. By this let vs learne that ſuch is the blockiſhneſſe, ſuch is the blindneſſe of men, that in ſeing they ſee not, in hearing they heare not, vntill ſuch time as God doth giue them new eyes and newe eares. But we muſt note the ſpeech, that The heart of Lydia was opened, that ſhee might giue eare to the externall voice of the teacher. For as preaching alone is nothing elſe but the deade letter: ſo wee muſt beware leaſt a falſe imagination, or a ſhew of ſecreat illumination leade vs away from the worde, whereupon faith dependeth, and wherein it reſteth. For many, to the end they may amplifie the grace of the Spirit, feigne to themſelues certaine inſpired perſons, that they may leaue no vſe of the external word. But the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doeth not ſuffer any ſuch diuorce to bee made, which ioyneth the miniſterie of men with the ſecreat inſpiration of the Spirite. Vnleſſe the minde of Lydia had beene opened, Pauls preaching ſhould haue beene onely literal: and yet the Lord doth not inſpire her with bare reuelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons onely, but he giueth her the reuerence of his word: ſo that the voice of man, which might otherwiſe haue bin vttered in vaine, doeth pearce into a minde indued with heauenly light. Therefore let thoſe brainſicke fellows be packing, who vnder color of the ſpirit, refuſe external doctrin.
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:7788:205" rendition="simple:additions"/> For wee muſt note the temperature or moderation which Luke ſetteth downe here, that we can haue or obtaine nothing by the hearing of the worde alone without the grace of the Spirite and that the ſpirite is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vs, not that he may bring contempt of the word, but rather that he may dip into our mindes, and write in our heartes the faith thereof.</p>
               <p>Now if the cauſe bee demaunded why the Lord opened one womans heart alone, we muſt returne vnto that principle, that ſo many beleeue as are ordeined to life. For the fear of God which went before the plain and manifeſt knowledge of Chriſt in Lydia, was alſo a frute of free elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The deſcribers of ſituations of places, ſay that <hi>Thyatira</hi> is a citie of Lydia, ſituate vpon the ſide of the riuer called Hermus, and that it was ſometimes called Pelopia, but ſome there be who attribute it to Phry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia, ſome to Myſia.</p>
               <p n="15">15 <hi>When ſhee was baptized.</hi> Heereby it appeareth how effectually God wrought in Lydia euen in a ſhort moment. For it is not to be doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted but that ſhe receiued and embraced the faith of Chriſte ſincerely, and gaue him her name, before Paul would admitte her vnto baptiſme, this was a token of meere readineſſe: alſo her holy zeale and godlines doe therin ſhew themſelues, in that ſhe doth alſo conſecrate her family to God. And ſurely all the godly ought to haue this deſire, to haue thoſe who are vnder them to be partakers of the ſame faith. For he is vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie to be numbred among the children of God, and to be a ruler ouer others, whoſoeuer is deſirous to reigne and rule in his owne houſe ouer his wife, children, ſeruaunts, and maids, and will cauſe them to giue no place to Chriſt. Therefore let euery one of the faithfull ſtudie to gouern and order his houſe ſo, that it may be an image of the church. I graunt that Lydia had not in her hand the hearts of all thoſe which wer of her houſhold, that ſhe might turne vnto Chriſt whomſoeuer ſhe woulde: but the Lord did bleſſe her godly deſire, ſo, that ſhe had all her houſhold o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient. The godly (as we haue already ſaid) muſt indeuour with might and main to driue from their houſes all maner ſuperſtition. Secondlye, that they haue not profane families: but that they keep them vnder the feare of the Lord. So Abraham the father of the faithfull, was comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to circumciſe al his ſeruants with him: and he is commended for the care he had to gouern his houſe, and to inſttuct his family. Furthermore if this dutie be required at the hands of the houſholder, much more of a prince, that he ſuffer not ſo much as in him lyeth, the name of God to be profaned in his realme.</p>

                  <hi>She beſought them ſaying.</hi> This hath the force of an admiration, when ſhe ſaith, if ye haue iudged me faithfull: as if ſhe ſhould ſay, I beſeech you by that faith which you haue approued by baptiſme, that yee refuſe not to lodge with me. And Lydia did by ſuch an earneſt deſire, teſtifie, howe entirely ſhe loued the Goſpel. Neuertheleſſe it is not to be doubted, but that the Lorde gaue her ſuch an affection, to the end Paul might be the more incouraged to proceed: not only becauſe hee ſaw that hee was liberally and courteouſly entertained, but alſo becauſe he might therby iudge of the frute of his doctrine. Therfore this was not the womans in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiting
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:7788:206" rendition="simple:additions"/> only, but alſo Gods, to keep Paul and his company there, to which end that tendeth alſo, that Lydia inforced them: as if God did lay hand vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them and ſtay them in the womans perſon.</p>

But Luke followeth the common cuſtome of ſpeaking: becauſe he ſheweth the error of the common people, and not through what inſpiration the maid did propheſie. For it is certaine that the diuell did deceiue men vnder the viſure of Apollo, as all idolatrie &amp; ſubtiltie was inuented &amp; forged in his ſhop. But ſome man may maruell that the diuel (through whoſe motion &amp; perſuaſion the maide did crie) was the authour of ſuch an honorable commendation, wherewith ſhe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned Paul &amp; Silas, &amp; the reſt. For ſeeing that he is the father of lying, how could the truth proceed from him? Secondly, how is it that he gaue place willingly to the ſeruants of Chriſt, by whom his kingdom was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed? how can this hang together that he prepared the minds of the people to hear the goſpel, whoſe mortal enemy he is? Aſſuredly there is nothing more proper to him then to turn away the minds of the people
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:7788:206"/> from the word of god, which he doth now wil &amp; wiſh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to hear: whence co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth ſuch a ſodain change, or vnwonted motion? But the diuell is the father of lying in ſuch ſort, that he couereth himſelf vnder the falſe &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceiueable colour of truth. There hee plaied another perſon through his crafty ſubtilty, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was agreable to his nature, that by creeping in crafti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie he might do the more hurt: &amp; therfore wheras he is called the father of lyes, we muſt not ſo take it, as if he did alwaies lie manifeſtly &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any colour. Yea rather wee muſt beware of his craftie ſubtiltie, leaſt when he prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth the colour of truth, he deceiue vs vnder a vain ſhew. We ſee alſo how he vſeth like ſubtiltie daily. For what can bear a fayrer ſhew then the Pope his titles, wherin he doth not boaſt himſelf to be the aduerſarie of Chriſt, but his vicar? What can be more plauſible than that ſolemne preface, In the name of the Lord, Amen? Notwithſtanding we know that whiles the hypocriticall miniſters of Satan doe thus pretend the truth, they corrupt it &amp; with a deadly corruption infect it. Seing that Satan hath a double way to reſiſt the goſpel: to wit, bicauſe he doth ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times rage openly, &amp; ſometimes hee creepeth in craftily vnder lyes, hee hath alſo two kindes of lying and deceiuing either when he ouerthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the worde of God with falſe doctrines &amp; groſſe ſuperſtitions, or els when he doth craftily feigne that he is a friend of the word, and ſo doth inſinuate himſelf ſubtilly, yea he doth neuer hurt more deadly, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he transfourmeth himſelfe into an angell of light. Now wee perceiue to what end that ſo gorgeous a title did tend, wherwith he did extoll Paul and his companions: name lie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe it was not ſo conuenient for him, to make open warre againſt the goſpel, he went about to ouerthrow the credite thereof by ſecrete ſhifts. For if Paul had admitted that teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, there ſhould haue been no longer any difference between the whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome doctrine of Chriſt, and the mockes of Satan.

               <p>But the queſtion is why God doth graunt Satan ſo great libertie, as to ſuffer him to deceiue miſerable men, and to bewitch them with true di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinations.

                  </gap>eanes to lay open men who are retchles or careleſſe, to his ſubtiltie, ſo that they cannot beware. For ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that propheſies breath out diuine power, mens minds muſt needs be touched with reuerence ſo often as they come abroad vnleſſe they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne God. I anſwere, that Satan hath neuer ſo much libertie graunted him of god, ſaue only that the vnthankful world may he puniſhed which is ſo deſirous of a lie, that it had rather be deceiued, then obey the truth. For that is a generall euill,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.21.</note> whereof Paul complaineth in the firſt chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Romanes, That men doe not glorifie God being knowen na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally by the creation of the world, &amp; that they ſuppreſſe his truth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtly.</p>
               <p>It is a iuſt rewarde for ſo great vnthankfulneſſe, that Satan hath the
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:7788:207"/> bridle giuen him, that through diuers iuglings hee may worke the ruine of thoſe who turne away maliciouſly from the light of God. Therefore ſo often as you read the diuinations of Satan, think vpon the iuſt iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God.</p>
               <p>Nowe if God ſo ſharply puniſh the contempt of his light in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane gentiles, who haue no other teachers but the heauen &amp; earth, how much more ſharp puniſhment do thoſe deſerue who wittingly &amp; willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly choke the pure doctrine of ſaluation, reuealed to them in the law and the goſpel? No maruell therfore if Sata<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue long bewitched the world ſo freely with his ſubtiltie, ſithence that the truth of the Goſpell hath been wickedly contemned, which was made moſt manifeſt. But it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected again that no man is free from danger, when falſe diuinations flie to and fro ſo faſt. For euen as well the good as the euill ſeeme to bee ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to the coſonage of Satan, when the truth is darkened and ouercaſt. The anſwere is readie, though Satan ſet ſnares for all men in generall, yet are the godly deliuered by the grace of God, leaſt they be caught to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the wicked. Ther is alſo a more manifeſt diſtinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſet down in the ſcripture, becauſe the Lorde doth by this meanes trie the faith &amp; godlines of his: and doth make blinde the reprobate, that they may pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, as they be worthie.<note place="margin">2.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to himſelfe, ſeeing that he ſaith elswhere that he reioyceth vppon what occaſion ſoeuer he ſee the goſpel preached, euen by wicked men, and ſuch as did ſtudie of ſet purpoſe to bring him in contempt.<note place="margin">Phil. 1.18.</note> I anſwere that he had another more apter reaſon for himſelf in this place: becauſe all men would haue thought that the Spirit of the maide had plaid with Paul: ſo that by that meanes the doctrine of the goſpel ſhould not only haue come in ſuſpition, but ſhould alſo haue come into great contempt. To this end was it that Chriſte alſo did commaund the diuel to holde his peace,<note place="margin">Mark. 1.25. Luke. 4.35.</note> whereas notwithſtanding he ſuffered his name to be extolled by vnmeet and vnworthie men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I commaund thee.</hi> We muſt note the forme of ſpeech. For as the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle was about to haue a double vſe: namely, that the power of Chriſt might be knowen: ſecondly that he might declare that he had no felow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with Satans iuglings: ſo Paul in giuing the authoritie and power to Chriſte alone, doeth declare that he is only a miniſter, that done hee doth openly ſet Chriſt againſt the diuell, to the end that by the conflict all men may ſee that they be deadly enemies. For it was profitable that many ſhould be awaked, who had bin giuen to ſuch groſſe ſeducing, that being well purged they might come to the true faith.</p>
               <p n="19">19 <hi>But when her maſters.</hi> The ſame diuell who of late did flatter Paul by the mouth of the maid, doth now driue her maſters into furie, that they may put him to death: ſo that hauing cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged his coat he doth now play a tragedie: who could not ſpeed welbefore by his faire ſpeech and flatterie. And though the heat of zeale wherewith Paul was prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to anger did raiſe the whirlewinde of perſecution, yet is hee not therefore to be blamed: neither did it any whit repent Paul that he had wrought the myracle, ſo that hee did wiſh that that were vndone which was done, becauſe he knew full wel through what motion he had driuen the diuell out of the maid: whereby we are taught that we muſt not raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie condemne thinges which are well done, and that which is taken in hand at the commandement of God, though an vnhappie ſucceſſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low: becauſe God doth then examine the conſtancie of thoſe which bee his, vntill a more ioyfull and proſperous ende driue away all ſorrowe.
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:7788:208"/> As touching the men, Luke expreſſeth the cauſe why they were ſo mad vpon Paul: to wit, becauſe their hope of filthie gain was gone. But thogh they were pricked forward with couetouſnes only to perſecute the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel and the miniſters therof: yet they pretend a fair colour, that it gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth them that the publike ſtate ſhould be peruerted, that their ancient lawes ſhould bee broken, and peace troubled. So though the enemies of Chriſt behaue themſelues wickedly and vnhoneſtly, yet they alwayes inuent ſome cauſe for their ſinne. Yea thogh their wicked deſire appear plainly, yet with an impudent face they alwaies bring in ſomwhat to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer their filthineſſe withall. So at this day thoſe Papiſts which are more zealous ouer their lawe, haue nothing els in their mindes beſides their gain and gouernment. Let them ſweare and forſweare by al their Saints and ſacrifices that they are inforced only with a godly affection: yet the matter it ſelfe doth plainly ſhew, that it is the coldnes of their kitchins which maketh their zeale ſo whot, and that ambition is the fanne ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. For they be either hungrie dogs pricked forward with greedineſſe: or furious Lions breathing out nothing but crueltie.</p>
               <p n="20">20 <hi>Theſe men trouble our citie.</hi> This accuſation was craftily compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, to burde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſeruants of Chriſt. For on the one ſide they pretend the name of the Romans, then which nothing was more fauourable: on the other, they purchaſe hatred and bring them in contempt by naming the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Iewes, which name was at that time infamous: for as touching reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion the Romans wer more like to any, then to the Iewiſh nation. For it was lawful for a man which was a Romane to do ſacrifice either in Aſia or in Grecia, or in any other countrie wher were Idols &amp; ſuperſtitions, I warrant you Satan did agree with himſelf very well, though he put on diuers ſhapes, but that which was religion only, then which ther was no other in the world, was counted among the Romanes deteſtable. They frame a third accuſation out of the crime of ſedition: for they pretende that the publike peace is troubled by Paul &amp; his companie. In like ſort was Chriſt brought in contempt, &amp; euen at this day the paiſts haue no more plauſible thing wherwith they may bring vs to be hated,<note place="margin">Luk. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But we muſt valiantly contemn this filthie &amp; falſe infamie as did Chriſt and Paul, vntill the Lord bring to light the malice of our enemies, and refute their impudencie.</p>
               <p n="21">21 <hi>Ordinances which.</hi> They lean to a preiudice, leaſt the cauſe ſhuld com to be diſputed: as the papiſts deale with vs at this day, this was decreed in a general councell: it is a more ancient &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon opinion, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that it may be called in queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: cuſtom hath long time approued this: this hath been eſtabliſhed by conſent more then a thouſand yeeres agoe. But to what end tend all theſe things ſaue only that they may rob the word of god of all authoritie. They make boaſt of mans decrees, but in the mean ſeaſon they leaue no place at all for the lawes of God. Wee may ſee by this place what force theſe preiudices ought to haue. The lawes of the Romanes wer excellent, but religion doth depende vppon the worde of God alone. Therefore in this matter we muſt take great heed, that men
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:7788:208" rendition="simple:additions"/> being brought vnder, the authoritie of God alone do preuaile, and that he make all things which in the world are excellent, ſubiect to him.</p>
               <p n="22">22 <hi>The multitude came togither.</hi> When Luke declareth that there was great concourſe of the people made, after that a few men of no reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to wit, ſuch as did iuggle and coſin to get gaine, and whoſe filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes was wel knowen, had made ſome ſturre: he teacheth with what fury the world rageth againſt Chriſt. Foliſhnes and inconſtancie are in deed common vices among al people, and almoſt continual, but the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful force of Satan doth therein bewray it ſelf, in that thoſe who are in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matters modeſt &amp; quiet, are for a matter of no importa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in a heat, &amp; become companions of moſt vile perſons, when the truth muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted. There was neuer a whit more modeſtie to be found in the iudges themſelues: if we conſider what was their duty. For they ought by their grauity to haue appeaſed the fury of the people, &amp; to haue ſet the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues ſtoutly againſt their violence, they ought to haue aided &amp; defended the giltles: but they lay hands on the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> outragiouſly, &amp; renting their garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand them to be ſtripped naked &amp; whipt, before they know the matter. Surely the malice of men is to be lamented: whereby it came to paſſe, that almoſt all the iudgement ſeates of the world which ought to haue bin ſanctuaries of iuſtice, haue bin polluted with the wicked &amp; ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegious oppugning of the goſpel. Notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding the queſtion is, why they were caſt in priſon, ſeing they were already puniſhed: for the priſon was ordained for the keeping of men? They vſed this kind of correction, vntil they might know more: and ſo we ſee the ſeruants of Chriſt more ſharply handled, than adulterers, robbers, and other moſt vile perſons. Whereby appeareth more plainely that force of Satan in ſtirring vp the minds of men, that they obſerue no ſhew of iudgment in perſecuting the goſpel. But though the godly be more hardly handled for defending the truth of Chriſt, than are the wicked for their wickednes: yet it goeth wel with the godly, becauſe they triumph gloriouſly before god &amp; his angels in all iniuries which they ſuffer. They ſuffer reproch and ſlander: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they know that the marks of Chriſt are in greater price &amp; more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed in heauen, than the vaine pompes of the earth, the more wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly and reprochfully the world doth vex them, the greater cauſe haue they to reioyce. For if prophane writers did ſo honor Themiſtocles, that they preferred his priſon before the ſeat &amp; court of Iudges: how much more honorably muſt we think of the ſon of god, whoſe cauſe is in hand ſo ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as the faithful ſuffer perſecution for the goſpel? Therfore though the Lord ſuffred Paul &amp; Silas to be ſcourged &amp; impriſoned by the wicked Iudges: yet he did not ſuffer them to be put to any ſhame, but that which turned to their greater renown. For ſeing that thoſe perſecutions which we muſt ſuffer for the teſtimony of the Goſpel, are remnants of the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frings of Chriſt: like as our Prince turned the croſſe which was accurſed into a triumphant charret, ſo he ſhal in like ſort adorn the priſons &amp; gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bets of his, that they may there triumph ouer Satan and all the wicked.</p>

                  <hi>Renting their garments.</hi> Becauſe the old interpreter had truly tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this, it was euill done of Eraſmus to change it, that The Magiſtrates
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:7788:209"/> did rent their owne garments. For this was Luke his meaning only, that the holy men were outragiouſly beaten, the lawefull order of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being neglected, and that they laid hands on them with ſuch vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence that their garments were rent. And this had been too far diſagre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the cuſtome of the Romanes, for the iudges to cut their owne garments publikely in the market place: eſpecially ſeeing the queſtion was concerning an vnknowne religion, for which they did not great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly care, but I will not long ſtand about a plaine matter.</p>

                     <hi>27</hi> And when the keeper of the priſon awaked, and ſaw al the priſon dores open, drawing out his ſworde he was about to ſlea himſelf, thinking that thoſe which lay bounde were fled.</p>

               <p n="23">23 <hi>That he ſhould keep them ſafe.</hi> Whereas the Magiſtrates command that Paul and Silas ſhould be kept ſo diligently, it was done to this end, that they might know more of the matter. For they had already beaten them with rods to appeaſe the tumult. And this is that which I ſaide of late, that the worlde doth rage with ſuch blinde furie againſt the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the goſpel, that it doth keepe no meane in ſeueritie. But as it is very profitable for vs for examples ſake, to know howe vncourteouſly and vncomlie the witneſſes of Chriſte were entertained in times paſt: ſo it is no leſſe profitable to know that which Luke addeth immediatlie concerning their fortitude, and patience. For euen when they lay bound with fetters, he ſaith that in praier they lauded god, wherby it appereth that neither the reproch which they ſuffred, nor the ſtripes which made their fleſh ſmart: nor the ſtinke of the deep dungeon, nor the danger of death, which was hard at hand, could hinder them from giuing thankes to the Lord ioyfully and with glad hearts. Wee muſt note this generall rule, that we cannot pray as we ought, but we muſt alſo praiſe God. For though the deſire to pray, ariſe of the feeling of our want and miſeries, and therfore it is for the moſt part ioyned with ſorrow and carefulneſſe: yet the faithfull muſt ſo bridle their affections, that they mumur not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God: ſo that the right forme of prayer doth ioyne two affections together, to look too contrary: carefulneſſe, and ſorow, by reaſon of the preſent neceſſitie which doth keepe vs downe, and ioyfulneſſe, by reaſon of the obedience whereby we ſubmit our ſelues to God, and by reaſon
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:7788:209"/> of the hope which ſhewing vs the hauen nigh at hand doth refreſh vs e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in the midſt of ſhipwracke. Such a forme doth Paul preſcribe to vs.<note place="margin">Phil. 4.6.</note> Let your prayers (ſaith he) be made knowen to God with thankſgiuing. But in this hiſtorie we muſt note the circumſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces. For though the pain of the ſtripes wer greeuous, though the priſon were troubleſome, thogh the daunger were great: ſeeing that Paule and Silas ceaſe not to praiſe GOD, wee gather by this howe greatly they were incouraged to beare the croſſe.<note place="margin">Chap. 5.41.</note> So Luke reported before that the Apoſtles reioyced be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were counted worthie to ſuffer reproche for the name of the Lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And thoſe which lay bound.</hi> Wee muſt know that Paul &amp; Silas prayed aloud, that they might make the boldneſſe of a good conſcience known to others, who wer ſhut vp in the ſame priſon: for they might haue made their praier with ſecret groning and ſighing of heart as they were wont, or they might haue prayed vnto the Lorde quietly and ſoftly. Why doe they then exalt their voice? Aſſuredly they do not that for any ambitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but that they may profeſſe, that truſting to the goodneſſe of their cauſe they flie without fear vnto God. Therefore in their praiers was inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a confeſſion of faith, which did appertaine vnto a common exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, and prepared as wel the malefactors as the Iailers houſe to conſider the myracle.</p>
               <p n="26">26 <hi>There was an earthquake.</hi> The Lord in ſhewing this viſible ſign, ment chiefly to prouide for his ſeruants, that they might more manifeſtlye know that their praiers wer heard: yet he had reſpect alſo of the reſt. He could haue looſed the fetters of Paul &amp; Silas without an earthquake, &amp; alſo haue opened the gates. But that addition ſerued not a little to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme them, ſeeing that the Lord for their ſakes did ſhake both the aire &amp; alſo the earth: againe it was requiſite that the keeper of the priſon &amp; the reſt ſhould feele the preſence of God, leaſt they ſhould thinke that the myracle came by chaunce, Neither is it to bee doubted but that the Lord did then ſhew a token of his power, which ſhould be profitable for all ages, ſo that the faithfull may fully aſſure themſelues that hee will be nigh vnto them, ſo often as they are to enter cumbats &amp; dangers for the defence of the Goſpel. Neuertheleſſe he doth neither alwayes keep the ſame courſe, to teſtifie his pretence by manifeſt ſignes, neither is it lawful for vs to preſcribe him a lawe. For hee did helpe his by manifeſt myracles then, for this cauſe, that we may bee content with his hidden grace at this day: concerning which matter we haue ſpoken more vppon the ſecond chapter.</p>
               <p n="27">27 <hi>when the keeper of the priſon was awaked.</hi> He would haue ſlaine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that he might preuent puniſhment, For it had been a fooliſh anſwer to haue ſaid that the dores were opened of their owne accord. But this queſtion may be asked. Seing that Paul ſeeth that they might haue ſom hope to eſcape if he ſhould ſlea himſelf, why doth he hinder him: for he ſeemeth by this means to refuſe the diliuera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce which was offred by god: yea it ſeemeth to haue bin a meer toy, in that the Lord would haue the Iailer awaked, leaſt there ſhould be any vſe of the myracle. I anſwer, that
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:7788:210"/> we muſt in this place haue reſpect vnto his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſell &amp; purpoſe. For he did not looſe Paul &amp; Silas, and the reſt from their fetters, neither did hee therefore open the dores, that he might ſtreight way let them goe free: but that by ſhewing the power of his hand, he might ſeale vp the faith of Paul and Silas: and might make the name of Chriſte glorious among others. Therfore he doth ſo yeeld to the petitions of Paul and Silas, that he ſheweth that he is able enough to deliuer them ſo often as hee ſhall think it good: and that nothing can hinder him, but that he is able to en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter not only into priſons: but alſo into graues, that he may deliuer thoſe that be his. He opened the gates of the priſon to Peter to another ende as we ſaw chap. 12. But now foraſmuch as he had another way in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to deliuer Paul &amp; Silas, he meant not ſo much to deliuer them for the preſent time by myracle, as to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firm the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againſt the time to come. Again, we muſt cal that to mind which I ſaid of late, that the opening of the priſon appertained vnto others, that it might bee knowen to many witneſſes, that God did fauour the doctrine, which was now burthened with an vniuſt preiudice. Vndoubtedly Paul perceiued this: and therfore thogh his bands wer looſed, he did not once wag fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his place. He might haue gone away if he had been ſo diſpoſed: why doth hee not? Was it becauſe he contemned the grace of God? or becauſe through his ſlouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe he wil make the myracle fruſtrate? None of all theſe is probable: whence we gather that he was holden by God: as the Lord vſeth to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the minds of thoſe which be his in doubtfull matters, that they may follow ſometimes ignorantly, ſometimes wittingly, that which is expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to be done, and not paſſe their bounds.</p>

               <p>But it is a wonder that he was not reprooued for falling downe at their feete. For why did Paul winke at that,<note place="margin">Cha. 10.26.</note> which (as Luke recordeth) Peter would not ſuffer in Cornelius? I aunſweare that Paul doeth therefore beare with the keeper: bicauſe he knoweth that he was not moued with ſuperſtition but with feare of Gods iudgement ſo to humble himſelfe. It was a kind of worſhip common inough: but chiefly among the Romans it was a ſolemn thing, when they wold humbly craue any thing, or craue pardon, they fel down at their knees, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they put vp their ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Therfore there was no cauſe why Paul ſhould be diſpleaſed with a man whom he ſaw ſimply hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bled of God. For if there had bin any thing committed contrary to the glory of God, he had not forgotten that zeal which he ſhewed before among the men of Licaonia.

Therfore no meruel if all the diuinity of popery be nothing els but an huge lump and horrible la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byrinth: becauſe neglecting Chriſt they flatter themſelues in vaine and friuolous ſpeculatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. Secondly, we muſt note that after we haue imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Chriſt by faith, that alone is ſufficient to ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But the latter me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber which Luke addeth by &amp; by, doth better expreſſe the nature of faith, Paul and Silas command the keeper of the priſon to beleeue in the ſon of god. Do they preciſely ſtay in this voice only? Yea it foloweth in Luke in the text, that they preached the word of the Lord. Therefore we ſee how that faith is not a light or dry opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning vnknown thinges, but a plain &amp; diſtinct knowledge of Chriſt, conceiued out of the goſpell.

To conclude, Luke coupleth faith with preaching &amp; doctrine, &amp; after that he hath brieflie ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of faith, hee doth by way of expoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhew the true and lawful way of beleuing. Therfore in ſteed of that inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion of intangled faith, wherof the papiſts bable, let vs holde faith infolded in the word of God, that it may vnfold to vs the power of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="33">33 <hi>He was baptiſed and all his houſhold.</hi> Luke doth again co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly zeale of the keeper, that he did conſecrate all his whole houſe to the Lord: wherein doth alſo appeare the grace of God, in that he brought al his whole family vnto a godly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent And we muſt alſo note the notable exchange: he was of late about to murther himſelf, becauſe hee thought that Paul &amp; the reſt were eſcaped: but now laying aſide al feare, he brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth them home. So that we ſee how faith doth animate and incourage thoſe to behaue themſelues ſtoutly, who before had no hart. And ſurelie when we droupe through feare &amp; doubtfulnes, there is no better matter of boldnes, then to be able to caſt al our cares into Gods boſome: that no da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger may terrify vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doing our dutie, whiles that we looke for an end at Gods hand, ſuch as he ſhal ſee to be moſt profitable.</p>
               <p n="34">34 <hi>He reioyced that he beleeued.</hi> The external profeſſion of faith was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore commended in the Iayler: now the inward fruit therof is deſcribed. When he did lodge the Apoſtles, &amp; was not afraide of puniſhment, but did courteouſly interteine them in his own houſe, otherwiſe then hee was inioyned by the magiſtrate, he did teſtifie that his faith was not i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle. And that ioy wherof Luke ſpeaketh in this place is a ſinguler good thing, which euery man hath from his faith. There is no greater torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t then an euil conſcience: for the vnbeleeuers, though they ſeeke by all meanes to bring themſelues into a certain amaſednes, yet becauſe they haue no peace with God, they muſt needs quake and tremble. But ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit they perceiue not their preſent torments, yea they rage and playe the mad men, through mad and vnbrideled licentiouſnes: yet are they neuer quiet, neither do they inioy quiet ioy. Therefore ſincere and quiet ſtable ioy proceedeth from faith alone, when we perceiue that God is merciful to vs. In this reſpect Zacharias ſaith, Reioyce and be gladde O daughter Sion, behold thy king commeth. Yea this effect is euery where in the ſcripture attributed to faith, that it maketh the ſoules ioiful. Ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore let vs know that faith is not a vaine or dead imagination: but a liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſealing of the grace of God, which bringeth perfect ioy by reaſon of the certainty of ſaluation whereof it is meet that the wicked be voyde, who doe both flie from the God of peace, &amp; diſturbe al righteouſnes.</p>

<pb n="408" facs="tcp:7788:213" rendition="simple:additions"/> points, that they raged againſt, and cruelly intreated the body of a man that was a Roman: ſecondly, that they did that contrary to the order of law. We ſhall ſee afterward that Paul was a citizen of Rome. But it was ſtraitly prouided by Portius lawe, by the lawes of Sempronius, and alſo by many moe, that no man ſhould haue power of life or death ouer any citizen of Rome, but the people. Notwithſtanding it may ſeeme to bee a ſtrange thing that Paul did not maintain his right before he was bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with rods: for the iudges might honeſtly excuſe themſelues by his ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence: but it is to be thought that he was not hearde in the midſt of the heat of the tumult.

And wheras be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beaten at Philippos, &amp; ſcarce eſcaping out of great danger, he preacheth Chriſt at Theſſalonica, it appeareth therby how coragious he was to keep the courſe of his calling, and how bold he was euer now &amp; then to enter into new dangers. This ſo inuincible fortitude of minde, &amp; ſuch patient induring of the croſſe, doe ſufficiently declare, that Paul laboured not after the maner of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but that he was furniſhed with the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly power of the ſpirit.

All men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that this is true, that we muſt ſtay our ſelues vppon God alone: yet there be but a few, which heare him ſpeake in the ſcriptures. But and if that maxime take place among vs; that the ſcripture commeth of God: the rule either of teaching or of learning ought to be taken no where els. Whereby it doth alſo appeare, with what diueliſhe furie the papiſts are driuen, when they denie that there can any certaintie be gathered out of the ſcriptures: and therefore they hold that we muſt ſtand to the decrees of men. For I demaund of them whether Paul did obſerue a right order in diſputing or no? at leaſt let them bluſh for ſhame, that the worde of the Lord was more reuerenced in an vnbeleeuing nation, then it is at this day among them. The Iewes admit Paul &amp; ſuffer him when he diſputeth out of the ſcriptures: the Pope and all his, count it a meere mocke, when the ſcripture is cited: as if God did ſpeak doubtfully there, and did with vaine boughts mocke men. Hereunto is added that bicauſe there is at this day much more light in the ſcripture, and the trueth of God ſhineth there more cleerely, then in the law and prophets. For in the Goſpel Chriſt, who is the ſonne of righteouſnes doeth ſhed out his beam with perfect brightnes vpon vs, for which cauſe the blaſphemy of the papiſts is the more intollerable, whiles that they wil make the word of God as yet vncertain. But let vs know, as faith can bee grounded no where els then in the word of the Lord, ſo we muſt only ſtand to the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie thereof in al controuerſies.</p>

When the queſtion is concerning Chriſt, there come 3. things in queſtion. Whether he be, who he is, &amp; what he is. If Paul had had to deale with the gentiles, he muſt haue fet his beginning farther: becauſe they had heard nothing concerning Chriſt: nether do profane me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> conceiue that they need a mediator. But this point was out of doubt among the Iewes, to whom the mediator was promiſed: wherefore Paul omitteth that as ſuperfluous, which was receiued by common conſent of al men. But becauſe there was nothing more harde then to bring the Iewes to confeſſe that Ieſus who was crucified was the redeemer, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Paul beginneth with this, that it was meet that Chriſt ſhould die: that he may remoue the ſtumbling blocke of the croſſe, and yet we muſt not thinke that he recited the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

<pb n="409" facs="tcp:7788:214"/> that by making ſatisfaction for vs, hee hath purchaſed righteouſnes for vs. So doth Daniel<note place="margin">Dan. 9.24.</note> ſhew the force and fruit of his death in his 9. chapter, when he ſaith that ſinne muſt be ſealed vp, that eternall righteouſneſſe may ſucceed And ſurely there is no more apt or effectuall way to proue the office of Chriſt, then when men being humbled with the feeling of their miſeries, ſee that there is no hope left, vnleſſe they be reconciled by the ſacrifice of Chriſt. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> laying away their pride, they humbly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace his croſſe, wherof they were before both weary &amp; aſhamed. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt come vnto the ſame fountaines at this day, from which Paul fetteth the proofe of the death and reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Chriſt. And that definition brought great light to the ſecond chapter. It had not beene ſo eaſie a matter for Paul to prooue, and certainely to gather, that the ſonne of Mary is Chriſt, vnleſſe the Iewes had been taught before what manner redeemer they were to hope for. And when that doth once ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, it doth only remain that thoſe things be applied to Chriſt, which the ſcripture doth attribute to the mediator. But this is the ſumme of our faith, that we know that the ſonne of Marie is that Chriſt &amp; media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, which God promiſed from the beginning, that done, that we knowe &amp; vnderſtand why he died and roſe againe: that we do not feigne to our ſelues any earthly king: but that we ſeeke in him righteouſnes, and all parts of our ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Both which things Paul is ſaid to haue proued out of the ſcriptures: we muſt know that the Iewes were not ſo blockiſh, nor ſo impudent, as they be at this day. Paul might haue drawen arguments from the ſacrifices &amp; from all the worſhip of the law, whereat the Iewes narre at this day like dogs. It is wel knowne howe vnſeemelily they rent and corrupt other places of Scripture. At that daye they had ſome curtefie in them: alſo they did ſomwhat reuerence the ſcripture: ſo that they were not altogether ſuch as would not be taught: at this daye the veyle is laid ouer their hearts, ſo that they can ſee no more in the cleere light then moales.</p>
               <p n="4">4 <hi>Certaine of them beleeued.</hi> We ſee here the fruite of Paul his diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. He prooued flatly that Ieſus was Chriſt,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 3.15.</note> who by his death did appeaſe the fathers wrath for vs, and whoſe reſurrection is the life of the worlde. Yet onely certaine of the Iewes beleeue: the reſt are blind at noone day, and with deafe eares refuſe the certaine and playne trueth. This is alſo woorth the noting, that whereas onely a fewe Iewes belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, a great multitude of the Gretians who were farre farther of, came vnto the faith. To what end can you ſay they weer nouſſed vp in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the law from their childhood, ſaue onely that they might bee more eſtranged from God? Therefore the Lord doth now begin to ſhew ſome tokens of that blindnes in them which the prophetes doe often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times denounce vnto the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

Notwithſtanding he declareth by this that his couenaunt was not in vaine, becauſe he did at leaſt gather ſome of that people vnto himſelfe, that the ſparkles of the election may ſhyne in the remnaunt, which was ſaued freely. Luke doth moreouer teache that they did not beleeue the ſayinges of Paul onely ſo farre foorth, that they ſubſcribed vnto them with a cold conſent: but that they did
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:7788:215" rendition="simple:additions"/> teſtifie their earneſt of affection, becauſe they had ioyned themſelues to Paul and Silas as companions, &amp; prouoked againſt themſelues the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of their nation by the free profeſſion of the Goſpel. For what mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth this adioyning, ſaue only becauſe they profeſſed that they allowed that doctrine which he deliuered, and that they tooke his part? For ther is nothing more contrarie to faith, then if when we knowe the truth of God, we ſtand notwithſtanding in doubt, and are loth to ioyn our ſelues to any ſide. If any man had rather expound it, that they did ioyne them ſelues to Paul and Silas, becauſe they were deſirous to learne, that they might be better inſtructed at home: thereby doth alſo appear the liuely heat of faith: and that doth alwaies continue vnmoueable, that, No man doth truly beleeue in Chriſt, ſaue only he which doth giue ouer himſelfe to him, and doth freely and willingly fight vnder his banner.</p>

                  <hi>Of religious Grecians a multitude.</hi> Becauſe theſe had learned the firſt principles of Godlineſſe, they were neerer to the kingdome of GOD than others who had alwayes layd in the filth of ſuperſtition, Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the queſtion is howe the Grecians came by religion, who beeing bewitched with wicked errours and dotings, were without God:<note place="margin">Epheſ. 2.12.</note> as Paul teacheth. But wee muſt knowe that whither ſoeuer the Iewes were exiled, there went with them ſome ſeede of godlineſſe, and there was ſome ſmell of pure doctrine ſpread abrode. For their miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſcattering abroade was ſo turned vnto a contrarie ende by the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull counſell of God, that it did gather thoſe vnto the true faith who did wander in errour. And though religion were alſo corrupt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them with manie wicked inuentions: yet becauſe moſt of the Gentiles were wearie of their madneſſe, they were by this ſhort ſumme inticed vnto Iudaiſme, that, Nothing is more ſafe than the worſhippe of one and the true God. Therefore by religious Grecians vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande thoſe who had ſome taſt of the true and lawfull worſhip of God, ſo that they were not any longer giuen to groſſe Idolatrie. Though as I haue ſaid, it is to be thought that it was onely a light and obſcure taſt, which was farre from true inſtruction. Wherefore Luke doth vnproper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly giue them ſuch an honorable title. But as the Spirite of God doeth ſometimes vouchſafe ſome rude beginning and firſt exerciſe of faith, or the onely preparation the name of faith: ſo they are called in this place Religious, who hauing taken their leaue of Idols, had begun to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge one God.</p>
               <p>And though that confuſed or obſcure perſwaſion doth not deſerue of it ſelfe to bee counted religion: yet becauſe it is a ſteppe whereby wee come neerer vnto God, it taketh the name of the conſequent, as they cal it, or of that which followeth. Yea the blinde and ſuperſtitious feare of God, is ſomtimes called religion: not becauſe it is ſo in deed, but vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly, to note the difference betweene a meane worſhip of God, and groſſe and Epicuriſh contempt.

Whereby it doeth likewiſe appeare that their owne conſciences tolde them that they did amiſſe, ſeing they gat wicked men to take their part and to giue them their conſent. For ſeing the magiſtrate did fauour them, what did moue them to raiſe that tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt, ſaue onely becauſe they had no hope to haue any ſucceſſe vnleſſe matters ſhould be out of order and all ſhould be in an vprore? And Luke deſcribeth how ſuch fannes did raiſe ſedition: to wit, they gathered the people togither in troupes, and ſpred abroad their poiſon here &amp; there, vntill they were ſtrong ynough to make an aſſault: which pollicie is too common among ſeditious fellowes, as thoſe cities which are ſubiect to this miſchiefe doe fulwel know.</p>
               <p n="6">6 <hi>Thoſe men who haue troubled the whole worlde.</hi> This is the ſtate of the Goſpel, to haue thoſe vprores which Satan raiſeth, imputed to it. This is alſo the maliciouſnes of the enimies of Chriſt, to lay the blame of tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults vpon holy and modeſt teachers, which they themſelues procure. Aſſuredly the Goſpel is not preached to this end that it may ſet men to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither by the cares: but rather that it may keepe them in peace being reconciled to God. When Chriſt doth meekely wil vs there, to come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, Satan and the wicked, rage. Therefore Paul and Silas might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily haue defended themſelues: but it was requiſite for them to ſuffer this falſe ſlander for a time: and ſo long as they were not heard, to put it vp quietly. And the Lord meant by their example to teach vs, that wee muſt not giue place to ſlanders &amp; falſe reports, but we muſt ſtand ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in maintaining the truth, being readie to heare euill for things done well. Wherefore away with the peruerſe wiſedome of ſome, who to the end they may eſcape falſe ſla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders, ceaſe not to betray Chriſt &amp; his goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel through their trecherous moderation: as though their good name were more precious than Pauls and ſuch like: yea than the ſacred name of God which is not free from blaſphemies.</p>
               <p n="7">7 <hi>All theſe men &amp;c.</hi> The ſecond point of the accuſation is this, that they violate the maieſtie of the Empire of Rome. A great and grieuous crime: yet too impudently forged. Paul and Silas ſought to erect the kingdome of Chriſt which is ſpirituall. The Iewes knewe well that this might be done without doing any iniurie to the Romane empire. They knewe that they meant nothing leſſe, than to ouerthrow the publike e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, or to take from Caeſar his authoritie. Therefore the Iewes catch at the pretence of treaſon, that they may oppreſſe the innocent with the enuy of the crime alone. Neither doth Satan ceaſe at this day to bleare mens eyes with ſuch ſmokes and myſts. The Papiſts know fulwell, and they bee ſufficiently conuict before God, that that is more than falſe which they lay to our charge, That we ouerthrow al ciuill gouernment: that Lawes and iudgements are quite taken away: that the authoritie
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:7788:216" rendition="simple:additions"/> of Kings is ſubuerted by vs: and yet they be not aſhamed to the end they may make all the whole worlde offended with vs, falſely to report that we be enimies to publike order. For we muſt note, that the Iewes doe not onely alledge that Caeſars commandements were broken, becauſe Paul and Silas durſt preſume to alter &amp; innouate ſomewhat in religion: but becauſe they ſaid there was another king. This crime was altogither forged. But if at any time religion enforce vs to reſiſt tyrannicall edicts and commaundementes, which forbid vs to giue due honour to Chriſt, and due worſhippe to God: wee may then iuſtly ſay for our ſelues, that wee are not rebellious againſt kings: for they bee not ſo exalted, that they may goe about like Gyants to pull God out of his ſeat and throne. That excuſe of Daniel was true, that, Hee had not offended the king, whereas notwithſtanding hee had not obeied his wicked commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: neither had he iniuried mortall man, becauſe he had preferred God before him. So let vs faithfully pay to princes the tributes which are due to them, let vs bee readie to giue them all ciuill obedience: but if being not content with their degree, they goe about to plucke out of our hands the feare &amp; worſhip of god, there is no cauſe why any ſhould ſay that we deſpice them: becauſe we make more account of the power and maieſty of God.</p>
               <p n="8">8 <hi>They raiſed the multitude.</hi> We ſee howe vniuſtly the holy men were handled, becauſe they had no place granted them to defend the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, it was an eaſie matter to oppreſſe them, though they were guiltleſſe. We ſee likewiſe that it is no newe matter, for magiſtrates to be carried away with the rage of the people as with a tempeſt, eſpecially when the iniurie toucheth thoſe who are ſtraungers and vnknowen, at whoſe hands they looke for no reward: becauſe they will not come in daunger for nothing. For then they care not for reaſon or equitie, neither doe they heare the matter: but one driueth forwarde an other without any reſiſtance, and all thinges are done out of order, as when they runne vnto ſome great fire. But it came to paſſe by the ſingular goodneſſe of God, that ſo great heate was ſtayed by and by: for ſo ſoone as the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates profeſſe that they will knowe farther of the matter, the multitude is appeaſed: aſſurance is taken: and at length the matter is ended.</p>
               <p n="10">10 <hi>They ſent them out to Berrhea.</hi> Heereby it appeareth that Paul his labour brought foorth fruite in a ſmall time: for though the brethren ſend forth him &amp; Silas: yet they adioine themſelues as voluntary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions to their daunger and croſſe by this duetie. But the conſtancie of Paul is vncredible, becauſe hauing had ſuch experience of their ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berneſſe and malice of his nation: he doeth neuer ceaſe to trie whether he can bring any to Chriſt: namely, ſeing he knew that he was bounde both to Iewes and Gentiles, no iniurie of men coulde leade him away from his calling. So all the ſeruants of Chriſt muſt ſo wraſtle with the malice of the world, that they ſhake not off Chriſts yoke with what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuries ſoeuer they be prouoked.</p>

               <p n="11">11 <hi>Did excell in nobilitie.</hi> Luke returneth againe vnto the men of Theſſalonica. The remembrance of Chriſt might haue bin thought to haue bin buried by the departure of Paul, and ſurely it is a wonder that that ſmall light which began to ſhine, was not quite put out, and that the ſeede of ſounde doctrine did not wither away, which had neede continually to bee watered that it might ſpring vp. But aftet Pauls de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, it appeared howe effectuall and fruitfull his preaching had beene. For thoſe who had onely taſted of the firſt principles of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, doe neuertheleſſe profit and goe forward though hee be abſent, and exerciſe themſelues in the continuall reading of the Scripture. And firſt Luke ſaith that they were of the chiefe families. For the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie whereof hee maketh mention, is referred not vnto the minde, but vnto the nation. Some thinke that the men of Berrhea are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the men of Theſſalonica, becauſe hee ſaieth <hi>eugenesterous,</hi> and not in the ſuperlatiue degree <hi>eugenestatous.</hi> But I thinke that that manner of ſpeech is vſuall and common among the Grecians, which the Latines could not ſo well digeſt. Moreouer hee had ſaide a little before, that certaine principall women beleeued at Theſſalonica, and it is not to bee thought that the men of Berrhea were preferred before thoſe of this Citie. And there is a threefolde reaſon why Luke ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth mention of their excellencie of byrth. Wee knowe howe hardlie men come downe from their high degree, what a rare matter it is for thoſe who are great in the world,<note place="margin">Iames 1.11.</note> to vndertake the reproch of the croſſe laying away their pride, and to reioyce in humilitie, as Iames comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth.</p>
               <p>Therefore Luke commendeth the rare efficacie and working of the Spirit of God, when he ſaieth that theſe noble men were no whit hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the dignitie of the fleſh, but that embracing the Goſpel, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared themſelues to beare the croſſe, &amp; preferred the reproch of Chriſt before the glory of the world. Secondly Luk meant to make known vnto vs, that the grace of Chriſt ſtandeth open for all orders and degrees. In which ſenſe Paul ſaith, that God would haue al men ſaued: leaſt the poore and thoſe who are baſe do ſhut the gate againſt the rich (though Chriſt did vouchſafe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the former place).<note place="margin">1. Tim. 2.4.</note> Therefore we ſee that noble
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:7788:217"/> men and thoſe who are of the common ſort are gathered together, that thoſe who are men of honour &amp; which are deſpiſed grow together into one bodie of the church, that al men in general may humble the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, &amp; extoll the grace of God. Thirdly, Luke ſeemeth to note the cauſe why there were ſo manie added: and the kingdom of Chriſt was in ſuch ſhort time ſo ſpread abroad and inlarged at Theſſalonica. To wit, becauſe that was no ſmal helpe, that chiefe men and men of honour did ſhewe other men the way, becauſe the common ſort is for the moſt part mooued by authority. And though this were no meet ſtay for faith &amp; godlines, yet is it no ſtrange thing for God to bring the vnbeleeuers (who wonder as yet in error) to himſelfe, by crooked, and by wayes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Receiued the worde.</hi> This is the firſt thing which he commendeth in the men of Theſſalonica, that with a willing and ready deſire they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued the Goſpell. Secondlie, that they confirmed their faith by diligent inquiſition. So that their faith and godlineſſe are commendod in the beginning for forwardneſſe, and in proceſſe they are prayſed for their conſtancie and feruent deſire they had to profit. And ſurely this is the firſt entrance into faith, that we be readie to follow, and that aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning the vnderſtanding and wiſedome of the fleſhe,<note place="margin">1. The. 2.13</note> wee ſubmit our ſelues to Chriſt, by him to be taught and to obey him. Alſo Paul himſelf in adorning the Theſſalonians with this title, doeth agree with Saint Luke.</p>
               <p>As touching the ſecond member, this diligence is no ſmal vertue wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto Luke ſaith, the faithfull were much giuen, for confirmation of their faith. For many who at the firſt breake out, giue them ſelues ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to idlenes while that they haue no care to profite, and ſo looſe that ſmall ſeed, which they had at the firſt. But two inconueniences may bee in this place obiected. For it ſeemeth to be a point of arrogancie, in that they inquire that they may iudge: &amp; it ſeemeth to bee a thing altogether diſagreeing with that readines wherof he ſpake of late<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>: ſecondly for as much as inquiſition is a ſigne of doubtfulnes: it followeth that they were before indued with no faith which hath alwayes aſſurance &amp; certaintie ioyned and linked with it. Vnto the firſt obiection I anſwere, that Luke his words ought not ſo to be vnderſtood, as if the Theſſalonians tooke vppon them to iudge, or as though they diſputed whether the truth of God were to be receiued: they did onely examine Pauls doctrine by the rule and ſquare of the ſcripture, euen as golde is tried in the fire. For the Scripture is the true touchſtone whereby all doctrines muſt be tried. If any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſay that this kind of trial is doubtful, foraſmuch as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is oftentimes doubtful, and is interpreted diuerſe wayes: I ſay, that we muſt alſo adde the iudgement of the Spirit, who is not without cauſe called the Spirit of diſcretion. But the faithfull muſt iudge of euerie do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine no otherwiſe than out of, and according to the Scriptures, hauing the Spirit for their leader and guide. And by this meanes is refuted that ſacrilegious quippe of the Papiſts, Becauſe there can be nothing gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red certainely out of the Scriptures, faith doth depend onely vpon the determination of the Church.</p>
               <pb n="416" facs="tcp:7788:218"/>
               <p>For when the ſpirit of God doth commend the men of Theſſalonica, he preſcribeth to vs a rule in their example. And in vaine ſhould we ſearch the ſcriptures vnles they haue in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> light enough to teach vs. Therfore let this remaine as a moſt ſure <hi>maxime,</hi> that, No doctrine is worthie to be beleeued, but that which we find to bee grounded in the ſcriptures. The pope will haue all that receiued without any more adoe, whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer he doth blunder out at his pleaſure: but ſhall hee bee preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Paul, concerning whoſe preachtng it was lawfull for the diſciples to make inquiſition? And let vs note that this is not ſpoken of any viſured councell, but of a ſmal aſſembly of men: whereby it doth better appeare that euerye man is called to reade the ſcripture. So likewiſe making of ſearch doth not diſagree with the forwardneſſe of faith: for ſo ſoone as any man doth harken, and being deſirous to learne doeth ſhew himſelfe attentiue: he is now bent and apt to be taught, though hee do not fully giue his conſent. For examples ſake, An vnknowen teacher ſhall profes that he doth bring true doctrine: I will come being readie to heare, and my mind ſhall be framed vnto the obedience of the truth: neuertheleſſe I wil weigh with my ſelfe what manner doctrine it is which he bringeth, neither wil I embrace any thing but the certaine trueth, and that which I know to be the trueth. And this is the beſt moderation, when being faſt bound with the reuerence of God, we heare that willingly and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly which is ſet before vs, as proceeding from him. Neuertheles we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of the ſeducing ſubtletie of men: neither doe our minds throw the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues headlong with a blind rage, to beleeue euery thing without ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſement. Therefore the ſearching mentioned by Luke, doth not tende to that end, that we may be ſlow and vnwilling to beleeue: but rather readines with iudgement is made the meane betweene lightnes &amp; ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornneſſe. Now muſt we anſweare the ſecond obiection. Faith is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to doubtfulnes: he which inquireth doubteth: therefore it followeth that for as much as the Theſſalonians inquire and make ſearch tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the doctrine of Paul, they were voyde of faith as yet. But the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie of faith doth not hinder the confirmation thereof. I call that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation when the trueth of God is more and more ſealed vp in our hearts, whereof notwithſtanding we did not doubt before. For exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples ſake, I heare out of the Goſpel that I am reconciled to god through the grace of Chriſt, and that my ſins are purged through his holy blood: there ſhalbe ſome teſtimonie vttered which ſhall make me beleeue this. If afterward I examine and ſearch the ſcriptures more throughly, I ſhal finde other teſtimonies oftentimes, which ſhal not onely help my faith, but alſo encreaſe it and eſtabliſh it, that it may be more ſure and ſetled. In like ſort as concerning vnderſtanding, faith is increaſed by reading the Scriptures. If any man obiect againe, that thoſe men doe attribute but ſmall authoritie to Pauls doctrine, who ſearch the ſcriptures whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theſe things be ſo: I anſwere, that ſuch are the proceedings of faith, that they ſometimes ſeeke for that in the Scripture, whereof they are alreadie perſwaded by God, and haue the inward teſtimonie of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite. And Luke doth not ſay that the faith of the Theſſalonians was in
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:7788:218"/> all points perfect: but he doth onely declare how they were brought to Chriſt, and how they did profite in faith, vntill the abſolute building of godlines might he erected among them.</p>
               <p n="12">12 <hi>And many beleeued.</hi> This is not referred vnto the ſentence next going before, as if thoſe of whom he ſpake beganne to beleeue, making choiſe of ſome of them: for that were an abſurde thing. But Luke his meaning is: becauſe many were added by their example, the Church was increaſed in that Citie. And hitherto hath Luke declared the firſt beginning of the Church of Theſſalonica, leaſt any man ſhould thinke that Pauls labours did periſh through his ſodain and violent departure: for vnles I be much deceiued, he ſheweth for this purpoſe what fruit his preaching brought forth in the other Citie, before he came to the exile of Berrhea.</p>
               <p n="13">13 <hi>And when the Iewes.</hi> We ſee how the Iewes were carried to and fro with ſuch hatred of the Goſpel as coulde neuer be appeaſed. For they doe not onely expell Chriſt ſuriouſly when hee is offered vnto them at home but when they heare that he is preached elſewhere, they run thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like madde men. But we muſt not ſo much in this place conſider the furie of the nation, as the deſperate malice of Satan who pricketh for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward thoſe which be his to trouble the kingdome of Chriſt, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy mans ſaluation, &amp; he vſeth them as fannes to raiſe ſedition. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let vs know, that when at this day ſo many furious enimies doe ſet themſelues againſt the faithfull miniſters of Chriſt, it is not men which procure the war, but it is Satan the father of lying, who doth goe about all theſe things, that he may ouerthrow the kingdome of Chriſt. And though there be not alwayes the ſame forme in fighting &amp; encountring: yet will Sathan neuer ceaſe to make weary thoſe whom hee knoweth to ſerue Chriſt faithfully either with open war, or ſecreat lying in waite,<note place="margin">Iohn 8.44.</note> or domeſticall cumbates.</p>

<pb n="418" facs="tcp:7788:219"/> he ſaw idolatrie reigne more there then in any other place for the moſt part. The whole world was then full of Idols: the pure worſhip of God could be found no where: and there were euerie where innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble monſters of ſuperſtitions, but Satan had made the Citie of Athens more mad than any other Citie, ſo that the people thereof were carried headlong with greater madnes vnto their wicked &amp; peruerſe rites. And this example is worth the noting that the Citie which was the manſion houſe of wiſedome, the fountaine of all arts, the mother of humanitie, did exceed all other in blindnes and madnes. We know with what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations wittie and learned men did ſet forth the ſame, and ſhe had conceiued ſo great good liking of her ſelfe that ſhee counted thoſe rude whom ſhe had not pulliſhed. But the holy Ghoſt condemning the whole world of ignorance and blockiſhnes, ſaith that thoſe maſters of liberall ſciences were bewitched with an vnwonted madnes. Whence we gather what mans wit can do in matters which concerne God. Neither neede we doubt of this but that the Lord ſuffered the men of Athens to fal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to extreme madnes, that all the worlde might learne by them, and that they might teach all ages that the foreſight and wit of mans minde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing holpen with learning and inſtruction doeth altogither dote and is meere fooliſhnes when it commeth to the kingdome of God. They had vndoubtedly their cloakes and colours wherewith they did excuſe their worſhippings how prepoſterous and corrupt ſo euer they were. And yet notwithſtanding it is certain that they did not onely deceiue men with childiſh and friuolous toies, but that they themſelues were deluded ſhamefully with groſſe and filthie iugglings, as if they were depriued of common ſenſe &amp; were altogither blockiſh and brutiſh. And as we learne what manner religion proceedeth from mans vnderſtanding, and that mans wiſedome is nothing elſe but a ſhop of all errours: ſo we may know that the men of Athens being drunke with their owne pride, did erre more filthilie than the reſt. The antiquitie, the pleaſantneſſe and bew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Citie did puffe them vp, ſo that they did boaſt that the Gods, came thence. Therefore foraſmuch as they did pull downe God from heauen that they might make him an inhabitant of their citie: it was meete that they ſhould be thruſt downe into the nethermoſt hell. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer it be, the vanitie of mans wiſedome is here marked with eternal infamie by the Spirit of God: becauſe where it was principally reſident, there was the darknes more thicke: idolatry did reigne moſt of al there: and ſatan carried mens minds too and fro more freely by his mockes &amp; iugling. Now let vs come vnto Paul. Luke ſaieth, foraſmuch as hee ſaw the Cittie ſo giuen to Idolatrie, his Spirite waxed hote or was moued: where he doth not attribute vnto him indignation onely, neither doeth he onely ſay that he was offended with that ſpectacle, but he expreſſeth the vnwonted heat of holy anger, which ſharpned his zeale, ſo that he did addreſſe himſelfe more feruently vnto the worke. And here we muſt note two things. For in that Paul was wroth when he ſaw the name of God wickedly prophaned, &amp; his pure worſhip corrupted: he did thereby declare that nothing was to him more precious than the glorie of God.
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:7788:219" rendition="simple:additions"/> Which zeal ought to be of great force among vs: as it is in the Pſalme,<note place="margin">Pſal. 69.10. 2. Pet. 2.8.</note> The zeal of thine houſe hath eate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me vp. For is is a common rule of al the godly, that ſo ſoone as they ſee their heauenly father blaſphemed, they be ſore vexed: as Peter teacheth that the godly man Lot, becauſe he could not cure moſt filthie facts, did vex his heart. And teachers muſt aboue all other be feruent: as Paul ſaith,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 11.2.</note> that hee is gealous that he may retain the church in true chaſtity. And thoſe who are not touched whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſee and heare God blaſphemed, &amp; do not only wink therat, but alſo careleſly paſſe ouer it, are not worthie to be counted the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of god, who at leaſt doe not giue him ſo much honour as they doe to an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly father. Secondly we muſt note that he was not ſo greeued, that being caſt downe through deſpaire, he was quite diſcouraged, as wee ſee moſt men to be far from waxing hoat or being moued, when they ſee the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of God wickedly profaned, that in profeſſing and vttering ſorow and ſighing, they do notwithſtanding rather waxe profane with others, then ſtudie to reforme them. Neuertheleſſe they haue a faire cloake for their ſluggiſhneſſe, that they will not procure any tumult when they are like to do no good. For they thinke that their attempts ſhall bee in vaine, if they ſtriue againſt the wicked and violent conſpiracy of the people. But Paul is not only not diſcouraged with weariſomnes, neither doth he ſo faint by reaſon of the hardnes of the matter, that he doth caſt from him his office of teaching: but he is pricked forward with a more ſharp prick to maintaine godlineſſe.</p>
               <p n="17">17 <hi>With the Iewes and religious men.</hi> It was an ordinarie thing with Paul whereſoeuer the Iewes had Synagogues, there to begin, &amp; to offer Chriſt to his owne nation. After that, he went to the Gentiles, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing taſted of the doctrine of the law, though they were not as yet tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly nouſled vp in true godlines, did notwithſtanding worſhip the god of Iſrael, &amp; beeing deſirous to learne did not refuſe thoſe thinges which they knew were taken out of Moſes &amp; the prophets: and becauſe ſuche aptnes to be taught was an entrance vnto faith, yea was a certain begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of faith, the ſpirit vouchſafeth them an honorable title, who being only lightly ſprinkled with the firſt rudiments, drew neerer vnto the true God: for they be called religious. But let vs remember that they bee di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from others by this marke, that all the religion of the world may be brought to nought. Thoſe are called worſhippers of God ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, who gaue their name to the god of Iſrael: religion is attributed to them alone, therefore there remaineth nothing els for the reſt, but the reproch of Atheiſme, howſoeuer they toyle and moile in ſuperſtition. And that for good coſiderations, for of whatſoeuer pompe the Idolaters make boaſt, if their inward affection be examined, there ſhalbe nothing found there but horrible contempt of god: and it ſhall appeare that it is a meere feigned colour wherwith they goe about to excuſe their Idols.</p>
               <p n="18">18 <hi>They reaſoned with him.</hi> Luke addeth nowe that Paul had a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate with the Philoſophers: not that he ſet vpon them of ſet purpoſe, for aſmuch as he knew that they were euen borne only to braule and cauill: but hee was inforced to enter ſuche a conflict contrary to his purpoſe:
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:7788:220" rendition="simple:additions"/> as Paul himſelf commandeth godly teachers to be furniſhed with ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall weapons, wherewith they may valiantly defend the truth, if any e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies ſet themſelues againſt it. For it is not alwayes in our choyſe to make choiſe of thoſe with whom we will deale:<note place="margin">Tit. 1.9.</note> but the Lorde doeth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſuffer ſtubborne and importunate me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ariſe, to exerciſe vs, that by their gainſaying the truth may more plainely appeare: Neither is it to be doubted but that the Epicures, according to theyr wonted froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, did trouble the holy man: and that the Stoicks truſting to their ſub till quips and cauils, did ſtubbornly deride him: yet the ende ſhall ſhewe that he did not diſpute ſophiſtically, neither was he caried away vnto a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie vnprofitable and contentious diſputation: but did obſerue that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtie which hee himſelfe commaundeth elswhere: and thus muſt wee doe that by refuting meekely and modeſtly vaine cauellings, wee maye vtter that which is ſound and true: and we muſt alwayes auoid this dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, that ambition or deſire to ſhewe our wit, doe not inwrap vs in ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous and vain contentions. Furthermore Luke maketh mention of two ſects, which, though they were the one contrary to the other, had notwithſtanding their contrary vices. The Epicures did not only deſpiſe liberal arts: but were alſo open enemies to them. Their philoſophie was to feign that the Sun was two foot broad, that the world was made <hi>ex a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomis,</hi> or of things which were ſo ſmall that they could not be diuided or made ſmaller: &amp; by deluding men thus, to blot out the wonderful work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip which appeareth in the creatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the world: if they wer a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times conuict, they were as impudent as dogs. Though they did in a word confeſſe that there be gods: yet they did imagine that they were idle in heauen, and that they were wholy ſet vpon pleaſure, &amp; that they were bleſſed only bicauſe they wer idle. As they did denie that the world was created by God, as I haue ſaid of late: ſo they thought that mans affaires were toſſed to and fro without any gouerning, &amp; that they were not gouerned by the celeſtiall prouidence. Pleaſure was their feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie, not that vnbrideled &amp; filthie pleaſure, yet ſuch as did more &amp; more corrupt men by her enticements, being alreadie of their owne accorde bent to pa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>per the fleſh. They counted the immortality of their ſouls, but a fable, whereby it came to paſſe that they gaue them ſelues libertie to make much of their bodies. As for the Stoicks, though they ſaid that the world was ſubiect to the prouidence of god, yet did they afterward tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row a moſt filthie ſurmiſe, or rather doting, corrupt that point of their doctrine. For they did not graunt that God did gouerne the worlde by counſel, iuſtice, and power, but they forged a Labyrinth of the compaſſe or agreement of the cauſes, that God himſelf being bound with the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie of fate or deſtinie, might be carried violently with the frame of heauen: as the Poets do tie &amp; fetter their Iupiter with golden fetters: bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the fates or deſtinies do gouern when hee is about ſomething els. Though they placed felicitie in vertue, they knew not what true vertue was, &amp; they did puffe vp men with pride, ſo that they did deck the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues with that which they took from God. For though they did al abaſe the grace of the holy ghoſt, yet was there no ſect more proude. They had no other fortitude, but a certain raſh and immoderate fierceneſſe,</p>
               <pb n="421" facs="tcp:7788:220" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>Therefore there was in Paul wonderful force of the Spirit, who ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding amidſt ſuch beaſtes, which ſought to pull him too and fro, ſtoode firme in the ſound ſynceritie of the Goſpel: and did valiantly withſtand and endure, as well the dogged malapertnes of the former ſect, as the pride and craftie cauillings of the other. And hereby we ſee more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, what ſmall agreement there is betweene the heauenly wiſedome and the wiſedome of the fleſh. For though the whole multitude were offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the goſpel: yet the Philoſophers were captaines and ſtanderd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearers in aſſaulting the ſame. For that did principally appeare in them, which Paul himſelfe ſpeaketh of the wiſedome of the fleſh, that,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1.11.</note> It is an enimy to the croſſe of Chriſt: ſo that no man can be fit to learn the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the Goſpel vnleſſe he firſt abandon the ſame.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Other ſome ſaid.</hi> Luke ſetteth before vs two ſorts of men: which both were farre from godlineſſe: and yet the one ſort is worſe than the other. Thoſe who are deſirous to heare that againe which they call newe, firſt they are mooued not with any right deſire to learne, but with vaine cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſitie. Secondly they thinke vnhonourablie of the worde of God, in that they count it prophane noualtie. Yet becauſe they giue eare, and that being in doubt, vntill they may know farther of the matter, they are not quite paſt hope. But the reſt who proudly refuſe that which is offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, yea condemne it reprochfully, do ſhut the gate of ſaluation againſt themſelues. For this railing did proceede from monſtrous pride, what meaneth this Babler? Becauſe they neither vouchſafe to heare Paule, &amp; alſo reprochfully refuſe him, as if he were ſome common ieſter. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer they do not loath his doctrine through raſh zeale: but do openlie tread vnder foot that which is brought vnto them concerning religion, though as yet they know it not: becauſe theſe are aſhamed to learn any thing of a baſe and obſcure fellowe, who had hitherto profeſſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to be teachers of all the whole world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A declarer of new diuels.</hi> They doe not take diuels in euill part, as the Scripture vſeth to do: but for the leſſer gods or angels, who they thought were in the midſt betweene the higheſt God and men, whereof Plato maketh mention oftentimes. As touching the ſumme of the matter we muſt note that thoſe things which Paul ſpake concerning Chriſt and the reſurrection, ſeemed to them to be new diuels. Whence we gather that our faith is principally diſtinguiſhed and diſcerned from the ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Gentiles by theſe marks, becauſe it ſetteth forth Chriſt to be the ſole mediatour: becauſe it teacheth vs to ſeeke for ſaluation only at his hands: becauſe it comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth vs to ſeeke remiſſion of our ſins in his death, wherby we may bee reconciled to God: becauſe it teacheth that men are renewed &amp; faſhioned againe by his ſpirit, who were before pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, &amp; ſlaues to ſin, that they may begin to liue righteouſly &amp; holilie. Again, becauſe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuch beginnings as do plainly declare that the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God is ſpiritual, it lifteth vp our minds at length vnto the hope of the reſurrection to come. For as concerning other things though the Philoſophers do not reaſon purely yet they ſay ſomwhat. Yea they ſpeak much concerning eternal life &amp; the immortality of the ſoul: but as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:7788:221"/> faith which ſheweth free reconciliation in Chriſt: &amp; regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereby the Spirit of God doth reſtore in vs the image of God: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning calling vpon God, and the laſt reſurrection not a word.</p>
               <p n="19">19 <hi>They brought him to Mars ſtreet.</hi> Though this were a place appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for iudgement, yet Luke doth not meane that Paul was brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſeat of the iudges, that he might plead his cauſe before the iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Mars ſtreet: But that hee was brought thither, where was moſt commonly a great aſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>blie of people, that the ſerious diſputation might be had before a great and famous audience. And admit we graunt that he was brought before the iudgement ſeat: yet the end doeth declare that he was not preſented to the iudges, but that hee had free libertie to ſpeake as before an audience. And that which followeth ſhortly after touching the nature and conditions of the men of Athens, doth ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently declare that their curioſitie was the cauſe, that Paul had ſuch au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him: that he had ſuch a famous place granted him to preach Chriſt in: that ſo many came togither. For in any other place it had bin a crime worthy of death, to ſpeake in the market or in any other pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like place, hauing gathered a companie of people togither, but there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe who did carrie about trifles, had libertie granted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to prate by reaſon of the immoderate deſire they had to heare newes: Paul was permitted to intreat of the miſteries of faith, being requeſted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gaue themſelues to nothing elſe.</hi> The two vices which Luke reciteth, do almoſt alwaies go togither. For it falleth out ſeldome, that thoſe who are deſirous of noualties, are not alſo bablers. For that ſaying of Horace is moſt true, <hi>Flie a demander of questions, for the ſame is alſo a blab.</hi> And ſurely wee ſee that curious men are like rent Barrels. Furthermore both vices came of idlenes: not only becauſe the Philoſophers ſpent whol dayes in diſputing: but becauſe the common ſort was too much ſet vpon noualty: neither was there any crafts man ſo baſe there, which would not thruſt in himſelf to ſet in order the ſtate of Grecia. And ſurely that which Luk ſaith here is witneſſed by al writers both Greeke &amp; Latin, that there was nothing more light, couetous, or froward than that people. Wherefore there could neuer be any certaine gouernment ſet downe in that Citie, which was notwithſtanding the myſtres of ſciences. Therfore in princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal power, they had notwithſtanding no long liberty: neither did they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ceaſe off from attempting things &amp; making many hurliburlies, vntil they brought themſelues &amp; al Grecia to vtter ruine. For whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their ſtate was decaied, yet did not they forſake their boldnes. Therefore Cicero doth laugh at their folly, becauſe they did no leſſe fierſely ſet forth their decrees then, than whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they were lords ouer Grecia.

               <p n="22">22 <hi>Men of Athens.</hi> We may diuide this Sermon of Paul into fiue members. For though Luke doth onlie briefly touch thoſe things which he ſet downe in many words: yet I do not doubt but that he did compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the ſumme: ſo that he did omit none of the principall points. Firſt Paul layeth ſuperſtition to the charge of the men of Athens, becauſe they worſhip their gods at all a very venture: ſecondly he ſheweth by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall arguments, who and what God is, and how he is rightly worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped. Thirdly, he inueigheth againſt the blockiſhneſſe of men: who thogh they be created to this end, that they may knowe their creator and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, yet doe they wander and erre in darkneſſe like blind men. Fourthly, he ſheweth that nothing is more abſurd than to draw anie purtrature of God, ſeeing that the mind of man is his true image: in the firſt place he deſcendeth at length vnto Chriſt and the reſurrection of the dead. For it was requiſit to handle thoſe foure points generally, before he did deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend vnto the faith of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As it were more ſuperſtitious.</hi> The Grecians doe oftentimes take <hi>deiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daimonia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> in good part: notwithſtanding it doth ſomtimes ſignifie immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate fear, wherwith ſuperſtitious men do carefully torment the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, whiles that they forge to themſelues vain douts. And this ſeemeth to be the meaning of this place, that the men of Athens paſſe all meaſure in worſhipping god, or that they do not perceiue what maner work mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration ſhould be: as if he ſhoulde ſay, that they deale very vndiſcretly in that they weary them ſelues in going by waies, thus muche touching the wordes: now to the matter. He proueth by this one reaſon that all the worſhippings of the men of Athens are corrupt: becauſe they be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine what gods they ought to worſhip, becauſe they take in hande raſhlie and vnaduiſedly diuers rites, and that without meaſure. For in that they had ſet vp an altar to the vnknowen God, it was a token that they knew no certainty, they had in deed a great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany of gods wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they ſpake much: but when as they mixe them with vnknowen gods, they confeſſe by this that they know nothing of the true diuinitie. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, whoſoeuer doth worſhip god without any certaintie, he wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippeth his owne inuentions in ſteed of God. Howſoeuer credulous me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do flatter themſelues: yet neither doth god allow any religion without knowledge and truth, neither ought it to bee counted holy and lawfull. Yea how proud ſoeuer they be, yet becauſe they doubt in their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, they muſt needs be conuict by their own iudgement. For ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is alwaies fearful, &amp; doth euer now &amp; then coyne ſome new thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therfore we ſee how miſerable their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is, who haue not the certain
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:7788:222"/> light of the truth, becauſe they do both alwayes dout in themſelues, and looſe their labour before God. Notwithſtanding we muſt note that the vnbeleeuers whiles that they ſometimes make themſelues blinde tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row voluntary ſtubornnes, &amp; are ſometimes amid diuers and manifold douts, ſtriue &amp; fight with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues: oftentimes they do not only flatter themſelues: but if any man dare mutter againſt their folly, they rage cru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>elly againſt him: the diuell doeth ſo bewitch them, that they thinke no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be better, than that which pleaſeth them. Neuertheleſſe if ther ariſe any doubt, if any ſeducer put vp his head, if any newe folly begin to appeare, they do not only wauer being in dout, but alſo of their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord offer themſelues to be carried hither and thither. Whereby it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth that neither in iudgement, neither in quiet ſtate of minde, they ſtay and reſt in the common cuſtome of worſhipping God: but that they droup like drunken men. But carefulnes &amp; doutfulnes which doeth not ſuffer the vnbeleeuers to flatter and pleaſe themſelues, is better the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuch amaſednes. Finally thogh ſuperſtition bee not alwaies feareful: yet foraſmuch as it is inwrapt in diuers errors, it diſquieteth mens minds, &amp; doth prick them with diuers blind torments. This was the cauſe that the men of Athens did mixe their domeſticall Gods (whom they thought they knew becauſe in their vaine opinion they had inuented them) with vnknown gods. For thereby appeareth their vnquietneſſe, becauſe they confeſſe that they haue not as yet done as they ought, when they haue done ſacrifice to the familiar Gods, which they had receiued of their fathers, &amp; who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they called their country gods. Therfore to the end Paul may pluck out of their minds all vain &amp; falſe perſwaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, hee taketh this <hi>maxime,</hi> that they know not what they worſhippe, neither haue they any certain diuine power. For if they had known any god at al, being co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with him, they wold neuer haue faln away vnto vnknown gods, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as the knowledge of the true God alone is ſufficient for the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing of all idols.</p>
               <p n="23">23 <hi>To the vnknowen god.</hi> I can wel graunt that this altar was dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to all ſtrange gods: yet I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not yeelde to that which Ierome ſaith, that Paul did by a certain holy wilines attribute that to one God which was writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of many. For ſeing the ſuperſcriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in euery mans mouth, ther was no place for ſubtiltie: why did he then cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge the plural nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber? ſurely, not that he might deceiue the men of Athens: but bicauſe the matter did ſo require, he ſaid, that he brought doctrin co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning an vnknown god. And after he hath ſhewed that they are deceiued, bicauſe they knew not what god they ought to worſhip, &amp; had no certain God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head in a great heap of gods: he doth now inſinuat himſelf, &amp; doth pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe fauor for his doctrine: becauſe it was an vniuſt thing to reiect that which was vttered co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning a new god, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they had alredy giuen ouer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues: &amp; it was far better firſt to know him, then raſhly to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they knew not. Thus doth Paul return again to that prin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ciple, that god ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be worſhipped rightly, vnleſſe he be firſt made kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen. But here may a queſtion be moued: How he ſaith that god was wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped at Athens, who doth refuſe al worſhippings which are not agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:7788:222"/> to the preſcript of his law: yea he pronounceth that al that is idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, which men inuent without his woorde? If God allow no woorſhip, but that which is agreeable to his woorde, howe doth Paule giue this praiſe to men, who did dote without meaſure, that they woorſhipped God? For Chriſt in condemning the Samaritanes is content with this one principle in that they woorſhippe GOD without knowledge:<note place="margin">Ioh. 4.22.</note> and yet they did boaſt that they worſhipped the God of Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Then what ſhall we ſay of the men of Athens, who hauing buried and quite put out the remembrance of the true God, had put in place of him Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter, Mercurie, Pallas and all that filthierable? I aunſweare that Paul doth not in this place commend that which the men of Athens had done: but taketh from their affection though it were corrupt, free mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tet for teaching.</p>
               <p n="24">24 <hi>God who hath made the world.</hi> Paul his drift is to teach, what God is. Furthermore becauſe he hath to deale with prophane men, he draweth proofes from nature it ſelfe: for in vaine ſhould he haue cited teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Scripture. I ſaid that this was the holy mans purpoſe to bring the men of Athens vnto the true God. For they were perſwaded that there was ſome diuinity: only their prepoſterous religion was to be reformed. Whence we gather that the worlde doeth goe aſtray through bending crooks &amp; boughts, yea that it is in a meere labyrinth, ſo long as there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth a confuſed opinion concerning the nature of God. For this is the true rule of godlines, diſtinctly &amp; plainly to know who that God who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we worſhip, is. If any man wil intreat generally of religion, this muſt be the firſt point, that there is ſome diuine power or godhead which men ought to worſhip. But becauſe that was out of queſtion, Paule deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vnto the ſecond point, that The true God muſt be diſtinguiſhed from all vaine inuentions. So that he beginneth with the definition of God, that he may thence proue how he ought to be worſhipped: becauſe the one dependeth vpon the other. For whence came ſo many falſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippings, and ſuch raſhnes to increaſe the ſame often times, ſaue onely becauſe al men forged to themſelues a God at their pleaſure? And no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more eaſie then to corrupt the pure worſhip of God, when men eſteeme God after their ſenſe and wit. Wherfore there is nothing more fit to deſtroy all corrupt worſhippings, then to make this beginning and to ſhew, of what ſort the nature of God is. Alſo our Sauiour Chriſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoneth thus. Ioh. 4.<note place="margin">Ioh. 4.24.</note> God is a ſpirit. Therefore he alloweth no other wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers, but ſuch as worſhip him ſpiritually. And ſurely he doth not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilly diſpute of the ſecret ſubſtance of God: but by his works he decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, which is the profitable knowledge of him. And what doth Paul ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thence, becauſe God is the creator, framer and Lord of the world? to witte, that he dwelleth not in temples made with hands. For ſeeing that it appeareth plainly by the creation of the worlde, that the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes, wiſedome, goodnes and power of God, doth reach beyonde the bounds of heauen and earth: it followeth that he can be included and ſhut vp within no ſpace of place.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding this demonſtration ſeemeth to haue been in vayn,
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:7788:223" rendition="simple:additions"/> becauſe they might readily haue ſaide, that images and pictures were placed in temples to teſtifie gods preſence: and that none was ſo groſſe but that hee knewe that GOD did fulfill all thinges. I aunſweare that that is true which I ſaid a little before, that idolatrie is contrary to it ſelfe. The vnbeleeuers ſaid that they worſhipped the gods before their images: but vnleſſe they had tyed the godhead and power of God to I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, &amp; had hoped to be holpen thereby, woulde they haue directed their prayers thither? Hereby it came alſo to paſſe that one temple was more holie then another. They ran to Delphos that they might fet the oracles of Apollo thence: Minerua had her ſeate and manſion at Athe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. Now we ſee that Paul doth touch that falſe opinion, whereby men haue alwaies bin deceiued: becauſe they feined to themſelues a carnall God. This is the firſt entrance into the true knowledge of god, if we go with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out our ſelues, &amp; do not meaſure him by the capacitie of our minde. Yea if we imagin nothing of him according to the vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding of our fleſh, but place him aboue the world, &amp; diſtinguiſh him from creatures. From which ſobriety the whole world was alwaies far: becauſe this wickednes is in men naturally to deforme Gods glory with their inuentions. For as they be carnal &amp; earthie, they will haue one that ſhal be aunſwerable to their nature. Secondly after their boldneſſe they faſhion him ſo as they may comprehend him. By ſuch inuentions is the ſincere &amp; playn know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God corrupt:<note place="margin">Rom. 1.29.</note> yea his trueth as ſaith Paule is turned into a lye. For who ſoeuer doth not aſcend high aboue the world, he apprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth vain ſhadowes &amp; ghoſts inſteed of God. Againe vnles wee be carried vp into heauen with the wings of faith, we muſt needs vaniſh away in our owne cogitations. And no maruel if the gentiles were ſo groſly deluded and deceiued, to include God in the elements of the worlde, after that they had pulled him out of his heauenly throne: ſeing that the ſame be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fel the Iewes, to whom notwithſtanding the Lord had ſhewed his ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual glory.<note place="margin">Iſai. 66.1.</note> For it is not without cauſe that Iſaias doth chide the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding God within the walles of the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple. And we gather out of Steue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his ſermon,<note place="margin">Cha. 7.46.</note> that this vice was common to al ages, which ſermon is ſette down by Luke in the 7. chapter. If any man asked the Iewes whoſe groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes the holy ghoſt reprooueth, if they thought that God was included in their temple: they would ſtoutly haue denied that they were in anie ſuch groſſe errour. But becauſe they did onely beholde the Temple and did riſe no higher in their mindes, &amp; truſting to the temple, did boaſt that God was as it were bound to them: the ſpirit doth for good cauſes reprehend them, for tying him to the temple as if he were a mortal ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For that is true which I ſaide euen now, that ſuperſtition is contrary to it ſelfe, and that it doth vaniſh away into diuers imaginations. Neither haue the papiſts at this day any defence ſauing that wherwith the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles went about in times paſt to paint or couer their errors after a ſort. In ſumme, ſuperſtition doth feigne that God dwelleth in temples made with hands, not that it wil ſhut him vp as it were in a priſon: but becauſe it doth dreame of a carnal or fleſhly God, and doth attribute a certayne power to idols, &amp; doth tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſlate the glory of God vnto externall ſhowes.</p>
               <pb n="427" facs="tcp:7788:223"/>
               <p>But if God doe not dwell in Temples made with hands: why doth he teſtifie in ſo many places of Scripture, that he ſitteth between the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubines, and that the Temple is his eternall reſt? I anſwere, As he was not tyed to any place, ſo he meant nothing leſſe than to tye his people to earthly ſignes, but rather he commeth downe to them that he might lift them vp vnto himſelfe. Therefore thoſe men did wickedly abuſe the Temple and the arke,<note place="margin">2. Reg. 19.15. Pſal. 80.2. Pſal. 132.14.</note> who did ſo behold thoſe things that they ſtaied ſtil vpon earth, and did depart from the ſpirituall worſhip of God. Hereby we ſee that there was great difference betweene thoſe tokens of Gods preſenſe which men indented to themſelues vnaduiſedly, &amp; thoſe which were ordained by God: becauſe men do alwaies incline dounward, that they may lay hold vppon God after a carnall manner: but God by the leading of his word doth lift them vpward. Onely he vſeth midle ſignes and tokens, whereby he doth inſinuate himſelfe with ſlowe men, vntill they may aſcend into heauen by degrees and ſteps.</p>
               <p n="25">25 <hi>Neither is he worſhipped with mans hands.</hi> The ſame queſtion which was anſwered of late concerning the temple, may now be obiected tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching ceremonies. For it ſeemeth that that may be tranſlated vnto the worſhippings of the lawe of Moſes, which Paul condemneth in the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the Gentiles. But we may readily anſweare that the faithfull did neuer properly place the worſhip of God in ceremonies: but they did only count them helpes wherewith they might exerciſe themſelues ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their infirmitie. When they did ſlea beaſts, offred bread and drinke offereringes, light torches and other lights, they knew that god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe was not placed in theſe thinges, but being holpen by theſe, they did alwaies looke vnto the ſpirituall worſhip of God, and they made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it alone. And God himſelfe ſaith plainely in many places that he doth not paſſe for any externall or viſible thing, that ceremonies are of themſelues of no importaunce, and that hee is worſhipped no other wiſe but by faith, a pure conſcience, by prayer and thankefulneſſe. What did the Gentiles then? To wit, when they erected images, they offered incenſe, they ſet foorth plaies, and laid their couſhins before their idols, they thought they had fulfilled the offices of godlineſſe excellent well. Not only the philoſophers, but alſo the poets doe ſometimes deride the follie of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon people, becauſe they did diſorderedly place the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God in the pompe and gorgeouſnes of ceremonies. That I maye omit infinite teſtimonies, that of Perſius is wel knowne,

                  <pb n="428" facs="tcp:7788:224"/> And vndoubtedly the Lord cauſed profane men to vtter ſuch ſpeeches, that they might take away all colour of ignorance. But it doth plainely appeare that thoſe who ſpake thus, did ſtraightway ſlide back again vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon madnes: yea that they did neuer throughly vnderſtand what this meant. For thogh thoſe who paſſe the common people in wit, be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to confeſſe that bare ceremonies are in no eſtimation: yet it is vnpoſſible to pull from them this perſuaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but that they will think that they be a part of the diuine worſhip. Therfore the more diligently they giue themſelues to ſuch vanities, they doe not doubt but that they doe the duties of godlineſſe wel. Therfore becauſe all mortall men from the higheſt to the loweſt do thinke that GOD is pacified with externall things, and they will with their owne workes fulfill their dutie towards him, that doth Paul refute. There is alſo a reaſon added, becauſe ſeeing he is Lord of heauen and earth, he needeth nothing becauſe ſeeing that hee giueth breath and life to men, hee can receiue nothing of them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. For what can they bring of their owne, who being deſtitute of all good thinges, haue nothing but of his free goodnes? yea who are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but by his meere grace: who ſhal forthwith be brought to nought, if he withdraw the Spirit whereby they liue. Whereuppon it followeth that they are not onely dull but too proude if they thruſt in themſelues to worſhip God with the workes of their owne hands. For whereas hee ſaieth that almes and the duties of loue are ſweete ſmelling ſacrifices, that muſt be diſtinguiſhed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the matter which wee haue now in hand, where Paul doth only intreat of the ceremonies, which the vnbeleeuers put in place of the ſpirituall worſhip of God.

For he doth briefly aſſigne vnto them this cauſe of life, to ſeeke God. Againe for as much as there was not one kinde of religion only in the world, but the gentiles were diſtract into diuers ſectes, he telleth them that this varietie came from corruption. For to this ende in my iudgement, tendeth that, when hee ſaieth, that all were created of one blood. For conſanguinitie &amp; the ſame originall ought to haue bin a bo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of mutual conſent among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But it is religion which doth moſt of all ioyne men together, or cauſe them to fly one anothers companie: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vppon it followeth, that they be reuolted from nature, who diſagree ſo much in religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; the worſhip of god. Bicauſe wherſoeuer they be born, &amp; whatſoeuer place of the world they inhabite, they haue al one maker and father, who muſt be ſought of al men with one conſent. And ſurely neither diſtaunce of places, nor boundes of countries, nor diuerſitie of manners, neither any cauſe of ſeparation among men doeth make God vnlike to himſelfe. In ſumme, he meant to teach that the order of nature was broken, when as religion was pulled in peeces among them: &amp; that that diuerſitie which is among them, is a teſtimonie that godlineſſe is quite ouerthrowen: becauſe they are fallen away from God the father of al, vpon whom al kinred dependeth.</p>

                  <hi>To dwel vpon the face of the earth.</hi> Luke doth briefly gather as hee vſeth to doe, the ſumme of Paul his ſermon. And it is not to be doubted, but that Paul did firſt ſhew that men are ſet here as vpon a Theatre, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde the woorkes of God, and ſecondly, that he ſpake of the prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of God, which doth ſhew foorth it ſelfe in the whole gouernment of the world. For whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſaith that god appointeth the times ordained before, and the bounds of mens habitations, his meaning is, that this worlde is gouerned by his hand and counſel, and that mens affaires fall not out by chaunce, as profane men dreame. And ſo we gather out of a fewe words of Luke, that Paul did handle moſt weighty matters. For whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſaith that the times were ordained before by him: he doth teſtifie that he had determined before men were created, what their condition and eſtate ſhould be. When we ſee diuers changes in the world, when we ſee realmes come to ruine, lands altered, cities deſtroyed, nations laid waſt, we fooliſhly imagine, that either fate or fortune beareth the ſwinge in theſe matters. But God doth teſtifie in this place by the mouth of Paul, that it was appointed before in his counſel, how long he would haue the ſtate of euery people to continue, and within what boundes he woulde haue them contained. But and if he haue appointed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a certain time, and appointed the bounds of countries, vndoubtedly he hath alſo ſet in
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:7788:225" rendition="simple:additions"/> order the whole courſe of their life. And we muſt note that Paul doeth attribute to God not onely a bare foreknowledge and colde ſpeculatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as ſome men doe vndiſcretely: but he placeth the cauſe of thoſe things which fall out in his counſel and becke. For he ſaith not that the times were onely foreſeen, but that they were appointed and ſet in ſuch order as pleaſed him beſt. And when he addeth alſo that God had appointed from the beginning thoſe thinges which he had ordayned before, his meaning is, that he executeth by the power of his ſpirit, thoſe thinges which he hath decreed in his counſell, according to that: Our God is in heauen,<note place="margin">Pſal. 115.3.</note> he hath done whatſoeuer he would. Now we ſee, as in a campe euery troupe and bande hath his appointed place, ſo men are placed v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon earth, that euery people may be content with their bounds, &amp; that among theſe people euery particular perſon may haue his manſion. But though ambition haue oftentimes raged, and many beyng incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with wicked luſt, haue paſt their boundes: yet the luſt of men hath neuer brought to paſſe, but that God hath gouerned al euents from out his holie ſanctuarie. For though men by raging vppon earth doe ſeeme to aſſault heauen, that they may ouerthrow Gods prouidence: yet they are inforced whether they will or no, rather to eſtabliſh the ſame. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let vs know that the world is ſo turned ouer through diuers tumults that God doth at length bring al things vnto the end which he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed.</p>
               <p n="27">27 <hi>That they might ſeeke God.</hi> This ſentence hath two members: to wit, that it is mans duetie to ſeeke God: Secondly, that God himſelf co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth foorth to meet vs, and doth ſhew himſelf by ſuch manifeſt tokens, that we can haue no excuſe for our ignorance. Therfore let vs reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber that thoſe men doe wickedly abuſe this life, &amp; that they be vnworthy to dwel vpon earth, which doe not apply their ſtudies to ſeeke him. As if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery kinde of bruite beaſtes ſhould fal from that inclination which they haue naturally, which ſhould for good cauſes be called monſtrous. And ſurely nothing is more abſurd, then that men ſhuld be ignorant of their Authour, who are indued with vnderſtanding principallie for this vſe. And we muſt eſpecially note the goodneſſe of God, in that he doth ſo familiarly inſinuate himſelfe, that euen the blinde maye grope, after him. For which cauſe the blindneſſe of menne is more ſhamefull and vntollerable, who in ſo manifeſt and euident a manifeſtation, are touched with no feeling of Gods preſence. Whitherſoeuer they caſt their eies vpward or downward, they muſt needs light vppon liuely and alſo infinite images of Gods power, wiſedome, and goodneſſe. For God hath not darkly ſhadowed his glory in the creation of the worlde: but he hath euery where ingrauen ſuch manifeſt markes, that euen blind men may knowe them by groping. Whence wee gather that men are not onely blind, but blockiſh when being holpen by ſuch excellent te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies they profit nothing. Yet here ariſeth a queſtion, whether men can naturally come vnto the true and merciful knowledge of GOD. For Paul doth giue vs to vnderſtande, that their owne ſluggiſhnes is the cauſe that they cannot perceiue that God is preſent: becauſe thogh
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:7788:225"/> the ſhut their eies, yet may they grope after him. I anſwere that their ignorance and blockiſhneſſe is mixed with ſuch frowardnes, that being void of right iudgement, they paſſe ouer without vnderſtanding al ſuch ſignes of Gods glory as appeare manifeſtly both in heauen and earth. Yea ſeing that the true knowledge of god is a ſingular gift of his: &amp; faith (by which alone he is rightly knowne) commeth onely from the illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Spirit: it followeth that our minds cannot pearce ſo farre hauing nature onely for our guide. Neither doeth Paule intreat in this place of the habilitie of men: but he doth onely ſhew that they be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out excuſe, when as they be ſo blinde in ſuch cleare light, as he ſaith in the firſt Chapter to the Romans. Therefore though mens ſenſes faile the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in ſeeking out God, yet haue they no cloake for their fault,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.20. Cap. 14.17</note> becauſe though he offer himſelfe to be handled and groped, they continue not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding in a quandarie: Concerning which thing we haue ſpoken more in the fouerteenth Chapter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Though he be not farre from euery one of vs.</hi> To the end he may the more touch the frowardneſſe of men, hee ſaith that God is not to bee ſought through many crookes, neither need we make any long iourney to find him: becauſe euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhal find him in himſelf, if ſo be it he wil take any heed. By which experience we are conuict that our dulneſſe is not with out fault, which we had from the fault of Adam. For thogh no corner of the world be void of the teſtimonie of gods glory: yet wee neede not goe without our ſelues, to lay hold vpon him. For hee doth affect and moue euery one of vs inwardly with his power in ſuch ſort, that our blockiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is like to a monſter, in that in feeling him we feele him not. In this reſpect certain of the Philoſophers called man <hi>the little worlde:</hi> bicauſe he is aboue all other creatures a token of gods glory, repleniſhed with infinite myracles.</p>
               <p n="28">28 <hi>For in him.</hi> I graunt that the Apoſtles according to the Hebrew phraſe do oftentimes take this prepoſition <hi>in,</hi> for <hi>per,</hi> or by or through: but becauſe this ſpeech, that wee liue in God, hath greater force, and doth expreſſe more. I thought I would not change it. For I do not doubt but that Paul his meaning is that we bee after a ſort contained in God, becauſe he dwelleth in vs by his power. And therfore God himſelf doth ſeparate him ſelfe from all creatures by this word <hi>Iehouah,</hi> that we may knowe that in ſpeaking properly he is alone: and that we haue our bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in him, in as much as by his ſpirit he keepeth vs in life and vphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vs. For the power of the ſpirite, is ſpread abroade throughout all partes of the world, that it may preſerue them in their ſtate: that hee may miniſter vnto the heauen and earth that force and vigour, which wee ſee, and motion to all liuing creatures. Not as braineſicke menne doe trifle, that all thinges are full of Gods, yea that ſtones are Gods: but becauſe GOD doth by the woonderfull power and inſpiration of his ſpirite, preſerue thoſe thinges which hee hath created of nothing. But mention is made in this place properly of menne, becauſe Paule ſayde, that they needed not to ſeeke GOD farre, whom they haue within them.</p>
               <pb n="432" facs="tcp:7788:226"/>
               <p>Furthermore foraſmuch as the life of man is more excellent than motion, and motion doth excell eſſence. Paul putteth that in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt place which was the chiefeſt, that he might goe downe by ſteps vnto eſſence or Being, thus, We haue not onely no life but in God, but not ſo much as mouing: yea no being, which is inferiour to both. I ſay that life hath the preheminence in men: becauſe they haue not onely ſenſe and motion as brute beaſts haue, but they be indued with reaſon and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. Wherefore the Scripture doth for good cauſes giue that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular gift which God hath giuen vs, a title &amp; commendation by it ſelfe, So in Iohn when mention is made of the creation of all things, it is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded apart not without cauſe,<note place="margin">Iohn 1.4.</note> that life was the light of men. Now we ſee that all thoſe who know not God, know not themſelues: becauſe they haue God preſent with them not onely in the excellent giftes of the minde, but in their verie eſſence: becauſe it belongeth to God alone to Be, all other things haue their being in him. Alſo we learne out of this place that God did not ſo create the world once, that he did afterward depart from his worke: but that it ſtandeth by his power, and that the ſame God is the gouernour therof who was the Creator. We muſt well think vpon this continuall comforting and ſtrengthening, that we may remember God euery minute.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Certain of your Poets.</hi> He citeth half a verſe out of Aratus, not ſo much for authorities ſake, as that he may make the men of Athens aſhamed: for ſuch ſayings of the Poets came from no other fountaine ſaue onely from nature and common reaſon. Neither is it any maruell if Paul who ſpake vnto men who were infidels and ignorant of true godlineſſe, doe vſe the teſtimonie of a Poet, wherein was extant a confeſſion of that knowledge which is naturally ingrauen in mens mindes. The Papiſtes take another courſe, for they ſo leane to the teſtimonies of men, that they ſet them againſt the oracles of God: and they doe not only make Ierome, or Ambroſe, &amp; the reſidue of the holy fathers, maſters of faith: but they wil no leſſe tie vs to the ſtinking anſweres of their Popes, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if God himſelf ſhould ſpeake. Yea that which more is, they haue not been afraid to giue ſo great authoritie to Ariſtotle, that the Apoſtles &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes were ſilent in their ſchooles rather then he. Now that I may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne vnto this ſentence, whiche I haue in hande, it is not to bee doubted, but that Aratus ſpake of Iupiter: neither doth Paul, in apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that vnto the true God, which he ſpake vnſkilfully of his Iupiter, wreſt it vnto a contrary ſenſe. For becauſe men haue naturally ſome perſeuerance of god, they draw true principles from that fountain. And though ſo ſoone as they begin to thinke vppon GOD, they vaniſhe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye in wicked inuentions: and ſo the pure ſeed doth degenerate into corruptions: yet the firſt generall knowledge of god doth neuertheles remaine ſtil in them. After this ſort no man of a ſound mind can doubt to applie that vnto the true god, which we read in Virgil touching the feigned and falſe loue, that <hi>All thinges are full of loue.</hi> Yea when Virgill meant to expreſſe the power of GOD, through errour hee put in a wrong name. As touching the meaning of the wordes, it may be that
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:7788:226"/> Aratus did imagine that there was ſome parcell of the diuinitie in mens mindes as the Manichees did ſay, that the ſoules of men are of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God. So when Virgil ſaith concerning the worlde, <hi>The ſpirite doth nouriſh within, and the minde beeing diſperſed through all the ioynts; doeth moue your whole huge weight.</hi> He doth rather play the philoſopher and ſubtilly diſpute after the manner of Plato, then purely meane, that the worlde is ſupported by the ſecrete inſpiration of God. But this inuention ought not to haue hindered Paule from retayning a true maxime, though it were corrupt with mens fables, that men are the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of God, becauſe by the excellencie of nature they reſemble ſome diuine thing: this is that which the ſcripture teacheth that wee are created after the Image and ſimilitude of GOD.<note place="margin">Gen. 1.27. Gal. 3.26.</note> The ſame ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture teacheth alſo in many places, that we be made the ſonnes of God by faith and free adoption, when wee are ingrafted into the bodye of Chriſt, and beeyng regenerate by the ſpirite, wee beginne to bee newe creatures. But as it giueth the ſame ſpirite diuers names becauſe of his manifolde graces: ſo no maruell if the woorde Sonnes bee diuerſlie taken. All mortall menne are called Sonnes in generall, becauſe they drawe neere to God in minde and vnderſtanding: but becauſe the Image of God is almoſt blotted out in them, ſo that there appeare ſcarce anie ſlenderlineſſe: this name is by good right reſtrayned vnto the faithfull, who hauing the ſpirite of adoption giuen them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble their heauenly father in the light of reaſon, in righteouſneſſe and holineſſe.</p>
               <p n="29">29 <hi>Therefore ſeeing that.</hi> He gathereth that God cannot be figured, or reſembled by any grauen image: for as much as he would haue his image extant in vs. For the ſoule wherein the image of GOD is properly ingrauen, cannot be painted: Therefore it is a thing more abſurd to goe about to paint God. Nowe we ſee what great iniurie they doe to GOD, which giue him a bodily ſhape: when as mans ſoule which doeth ſcarce reſemble a ſmall ſparkle of the infinite glorie of God, cannot be expreſſed in any bodily ſhape.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, for as much as it is certayne that Paul doth in this place inueigh againſt the common ſuperſtition of all the gentiles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they would woorſhippe God vnder bodily ſhapes: we muſt holde this generall doctrine, that God is falſly and wickedly transfigured, and that his trueth is turned into a lie, ſo often as his maieſtie is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by any viſible ſhape:<note place="margin">Rom. 1.23.</note> as the ſame Paul teacheth in the firſt chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Romaines. And though the Idolaters of all times wanted not their cloakes and colours: yet that was not without cauſe alwayes obiected to them by the Prophetes, which Paul doth now obiect, that God is made like to wood or ſtone, or golde, when there is any image made to him of dead and corruptible matter. The Gentiles vſed i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages that according to their rudeneſſe, they might better conceiue that God was nigh vnto them. But ſeeing that God doth farre ſurpaſſe the capacitie of our minde, whoſoeuer attempteth with his minde to comprehend him, he deformeth and disfigureth his glorie with a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:7788:227"/> and falſe imagination. Wherefore it is wickedneſſe to imagine any thing of him according to our owne ſenſe. Againe, that which worſe is, it appeareth plainely, that men erect pictures and images to God for no other cauſe, ſaue onely becauſe they conceiue ſome carnall thing of him: wherein he is blaſphemed. The Papiſtes alſo are at this day no whit more excuſable. For what colours ſoeuer they inuent to paint and colour thoſe images, wherby they goe about to expreſſe GOD, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they be inwrapped in the ſame errour, wherein the menne of olde time were intangled, they bee vrged with the teſtimonies of the prophetes. And that the Heathen did vſe the ſame excuſes in tymes paſt, wherewith the papiſtes goe about to couer them ſelues at this daye, it is w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ll knowne out of their owne bookes. Therefore the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes, doe not eſcape the mockes of certayne, as if they layd too great groſneſſe to their charge, yea burthen them with falſe accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: but when all thinges are well weighed, thoſe who will iudge rightly ſhall finde, that whatſoeuer ſtarting hoales, euen the moſt wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie menne haue ſought, yet were they taken with this madneſſe, that God is wel pleaſed with the ſacrifice done before images. Whereas we with Eraſmus tranſlate it <hi>Numen,</hi> Luke putteth <hi>Theion</hi> in the neuter gender for diuinitie or godhead. When Paule denieth, that GOD is like to golde or ſiluer, or ſtone, and addeth afterwarde Grauen by cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or inuention of man, he excludeth both matter and forme, and doeth alſo condemne al inuentions of men, which disfigure the true na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God.</p>

Paul preuenteth this queſtion: ſhewing that menne went aſtray ſo long therefore, becauſe God did not reach out his hande from heauen, that hee might bring them backe againe into the waye. It may ſeeme an inconuenient thing, that menne indued with reaſon
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:7788:227" rendition="simple:additions"/> and iudgement ſhould erre ſo groſſely &amp; filthily in a moſt weightie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But Paul his meaning is that men do neuer make an ende of erring, vntill God do helpe them. And now he aſſigneth no other cauſe why he did not redreſſe this any ſooner, ſaue onely his good pleaſure. And aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly we be not able to comprehend the reaſon why god did at a ſodaine ſet vp the light of his doctrine, when he ſuffered men to walke in darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes fower thouſand yeeres: at leaſt ſeing the ſcripture doth conceale it, let vs heere make more account of ſobrietie, than of prepoſterous wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. For they goe about to bring God within bounds: which is a moſt vnſeemely thing and contrary to nature her ſelf, whoſoeuer they be that will not ſuffer him to ſpeake or holde his peace at his pleaſure. Againe thoſe that will not bee content with his wiſedome and ſecreat counſell, muſt needs murmure againſt Paul, who teacheth manifeſtly that igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance did reigne in the world ſo long as it pleaſed God to winke at it. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therſome interpret it otherwiſe, that God did ſpare ignorance, as if he did winke, being vnwilling to puniſh it: but that ſurmiſe is altogither contrarie to Paul his meaning and purpoſe: who meant not to leſſen mans fault, but to magnifie the grace of God which did appeare at a ſodaine, and it is proued to bee falſe out of other places: becauſe thoſe who haue ſinned without Lawe,<note place="margin">Rom. 2.12.</note> ſhall notwithſtanding periſh without Lawe. In ſumme, Paul his wordes carrie with them this meaning one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that men were ſet vppon blindneſſe, vntill God did reueale himſelfe vnto them: and that we ought not too curiouſly and boldly to demande and require the cauſe why hee put away darkneſſe no ſooner: but that whatſoeuer pleaſed him ought to ſeem to vs right and equall without making any more adoe. For though this bee a hard ſpeech that men were miſerablie deceiued long time, whiles that God made as though he ſawe it not: yet muſt we bee content with, and ſtay our ſelues vpon his prouidence. And if at any time there come vppon vs a vaine and peruerſe deſire to know more than is meete for vs, let vs ſtreightway cal to minde that which Paul teacheth in manie places, that,<note place="margin">Rom. 16.25. Epheſ. 3.9.</note> It was a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie hid ſince the beginning of the worlde, in that the light of the Goſpel did appeare to the Gentiles at a ſodaine: and that this is a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the manifold wiſedome of God, which ſwalloweth vp all the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of men. Againe let vs remember that it doeth not leſſen the fault of men, becauſe God would not heale their erroures: foraſmuch as their owne conſcience ſhall alwayes holde them conuict, that they cannot eſcape iuſt damnation. And Paul (not that he might lay the fault and blame vppon God, but that hee might cut off occaſion of curious and hurtfull queſtions) ſaide that the worlde did erre whiles God did winke. And hereby wee learne howe reuerently wee ought to thinke of Gods prouidence: leaſt anie man ſhoulde bee ſo bolde, as mans nature is proude, to demaunde a reaſon of God of his workes. Furthermore this admonition is no leſſe profitable for vs, than for the men of that time. The enimies of the Goſpel when it beginneth to ſpring againe, count it a great abſurditie that God did ſuffer men to go aſtray ſo long vnder the apoſtacie of the Pope: as if (though there appeare no reaſon)
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:7788:228"/> it were not as lawfull for him nowe to winke at mens ignorance, as in times paſt. And we muſt principally note to what end he ſaieth this, to wit, that the ignorance of former time may not hinder vs from obeying God without delay, when he ſpeaketh. Moſt men thinke that they haue a faire colour for their errour, ſo they haue their fathers to keepe them companie, or ſo they get ſome patronage or defenſe by long cuſtom: yea they would willingly creepe out heere, that they may not obey the word of God. But Paul ſaieth that we muſt not ſet an excuſe from our fathers ignorance, when god ſpeaketh vnto vs: becauſe though they be not gilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe before God, yet our ſluggiſhnes is more intollerable, if we be blind at noone day: and lie as deafe, or as if we were a ſleepe, when the trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet of the Goſpel doth ſound.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now he willeth all men.</hi> In theſe wordes Paul teacheth that wee muſt giue eare to God ſo ſoone as he ſpeaketh, as it is written, To day if yee will heare his voice harden not your hearts, For the ſtubbernes of thoſe men is without excuſe, who forſlow this opportunitie when God doeth gently call them vnto him. Alſo we gather out of this place to what end the Goſpel is preached:<note place="margin">Pſal. 95.7.8. Heb. 3.7.8.</note> to wit, that God may gather vs to himſelf from the former errours of our life. Therefore ſo oft as the voice of the goſpel doeth ſounde in our eares, let vs know that God doeth exhort vs vnto repentance. We muſt alſo note that he attributeth to God the perſon of the ſpeaker, though he do it by man. For otherwiſe the Goſpel hath not ſo full authoritie as the heauenly truth deſerueth, ſaue onely when our faith doth looke vnto him who is the gouernor of the propheticall fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and doth depend vpon his mouth.</p>
               <p n="31">31 <hi>Becauſe he hath appointed a day.</hi> Hee maketh mention of the laſt iudgement that he may awake them out of their dreame. For we knowe how hard a matter it is for men to denie themſelues. Therefore they muſt be violently enforced vnto repentance, which cannot be done bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then when they be cited to appeare before gods iudgement ſeat, and that feareful iudgement is ſet before them, which they may neither de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpice nor eſcape. Therefore let vs remember that the doctrine of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance doth than take place, when me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who would naturally deſire to flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter themſelues, are awaked with feare of Gods iudgement, &amp; that none are fit teachers of the goſpell but thoſe who are the criers or apparitors of the higheſt iudge, who bring thoſe who are to come before the iudge, to plead their cauſe, &amp; denou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce the iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t hanging ouer their heads, euen as if it were in their owne hand. Neither is this added in vaine in <hi>righteouſnes, or righteouſlie.</hi> For though all men in the word confeſſe that God is a iuſt iudge: yet we ſee howe they for the moſt part, pamper and flatter themſelues: for they will not ſuffer God to demaund an account farther than their knowledge and vnderſtanding doth reach. Therefore Paul his meaning is that men do profit themſelues nothing by vain flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie: becauſe they ſhal not preiudice gods iuſtice by this meanes, which ſheweth that all that is an abhomination before God which ſeemeth goodly in the ſight of men: becauſe hee will not followe the decrees of men, but that forme which himſelfe hath appointed.</p>
               <pb n="437" facs="tcp:7788:228"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>By the man who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he hath appointed.</hi> It is not to be doubted but that Paule ſpake more largely concerning Chriſte, that the Athenienſes mighte knowe that he is the ſonne of God, by whom ſaluation was brought to the worlde, and who had all power giuen him in heauen and earth. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe this ſpeeche which we reade here, ſhoulde haue had but ſmall force to perſwade. But Luke thought it ſufficient to gather the ſumme of the Sermon briefly. Yet is it to bee thought that Paule ſpake firſte concerning the grace of Chriſt, and that he did firſt preach him to be the Redeemer of men, before he made him a iudge. But becauſe Chriſt is oftentimes contemned, when he offereth himſelfe to be a Redeemer: Paul denounceth that he will once ſharpely puniſhe ſuch wicked con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, becauſe the whole world muſt be iudged by him. The woorde <hi>orizein</hi> may be referred, as well vnto the ſecrete counſel of God, as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to externall manifeſtation. Yet becauſe the former expoſition is more common, I doe willingly imbrace the ſame, to wit, that God by his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall decree, hath ordained his ſonne to bee the iudge of the worlde: &amp; that to the ende the reprobate who refuſe to be ruled by Chriſt, may learne that they ſtriue but in vaine againſt the decree of GOD which cannot be broken. But becauſe nothing ſeemeth more ſtrange to men, then that God ſhal iudge in the perſon of man, Paul addeth afterward, that this dignity of Chriſt, which were harde to bee beleeued, was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued by his reſurrection.</p>
               <p>The will of God alone ought to be ſo reuerenced among vs, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man for himſelfe ſubſcribe to his decrees without delay: becauſe the cloke and colour of ignoraunce vſeth oftentimes to bee obiected, therefore Paule ſaieth plainely, that Chriſt was by his reſurrection o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly ſhewed to be the iudge of the worlde, and that that was reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the eyes of men, which GOD had before determined with himſelfe, concerning him. For that poynt of doctrine which Luke tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth brieflie in fewe woordes, was handeled by Paul at large. Hee ſaide not onely in a woorde that Chriſt roſe from death: but hee did alſo intreate of the power of his reſurrection, as was meete. For to what ende did Chriſte riſe, but that he might bee the firſt fruites of thoſe which riſe againe? And to what ende ſhall wee riſe againe,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15.23.</note> but either to life or death? Wherevppon it followeth, that Chriſte by his reſurrection is declared and prooued to bee the Iudge of the worlde.</p>
               <p n="32">32 <hi>Some mocked.</hi> By this we ſee how great the careleſneſſe of men is whom neither the tribunall ſeate of God,<note place="margin">Cha. 26.23.</note> nor the maieſty of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt iudge doth make afraid. We haue ſaid that this is a moſt ſharp prick, wherewith mens mindes are pricked forward to feare GOD, when his iudgement is ſet before their eies: but there is ſuch vnſpeakeable hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in the contemners, that they are not afraid to count that a fable or lie, which is ſpoken co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the giuing of an account of our life once.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding there is no cauſe why the miniſters of the Goſpell ſhoulde omit the preaching of the iudgement which is inioyned them. Though the wicked doe laugh and mocke: yet this doctrine which
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:7788:229" rendition="simple:additions"/> they goe about to make of none effect ſhal ſo gird them, that they ſhall at length perceiue that they haue ſtriuen in vaine with their ſnare. And no maruel if this point of Paul his doctrine were derided at Athens. For it is a myſtery hid from mens minds, wheron the chiefeſt Philoſophers did neuer thinke, neither can we otherwiſe comprehend it, then when we lift vp the eies of faith vnto the infinite power of God. And yet Paul his ſermon was not altogether without fruite: becauſe there were ſome of the hearers which were deſirous to profit and go forward. For when they ſay that they wil heare him againe, their meaning is that though they were not as yet throughly perſuaded, yet had they ſome taſt, which did prouoke them to be deſirous to profit. Surely this deſire was contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to lothſomnes.</p>
               <p n="34">34 <hi>Among whom was alſo Dioniſius.</hi> Seing that Luke doth name one man and one woman onely, it appeareth that there was but a ſmall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of thoſe which beleeued at the firſt. For thoſe other of whom he maketh mention remained indifferent. Becauſe they did neither whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſpiſe Paul his doctrine: neither were they ſo throughly touched, that they ioyned them ſelues vnto him that they might be his ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers. Luke maketh mention of Dioniſius aboue the reſt, becauſe hee was in no ſmall authoritie among his Citizens. Therefore it is likelie that Damaris was alſo a woman of ſome renowne.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, it is ridiculous in that the papiſtes made of a Iudge, an Aſtrologer. But this is to be imputed partly to their ignorance, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to their boldneſſe, who ſeeing, they knewe not what <hi>Areopagus</hi> or <hi>Mars</hi> ſtreete meant, tooke to themſelues libertie to feigne whatſoeuer they woulde. And their rudeneſſe is too groſſe, who aſcribe the bookes of the heauenly and eccleſiaſticall Hierarchie, and of the names of God, to this Dionyſius. For the heauenly Hierarchie is ſtuffed not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie with manie doltiſh and moonkiſh trifles, but alſo with many abſurd inuentions, and wicked ſpeculations. And the bookes of the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall Hierarchie, doe themſelues declare, that they were made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeeres after: when as the puritie of chriſtianitie was corrupt with an huge heape of ceremonies. As for the Booke of the names of GOD, though it haue in it ſome thinges which are not altogether to bee deſpiſed, yet it doeth rather breath out ſubtilties, then ſounde godlineſſe.</p>

                     <hi>5</hi> And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was forced in the Spirit, testifying to the Iewes that Ieſus was Christ.</p>
               </q>
               <p n="1">1 This hiſtorie is worthy to bee remembred euen for this one cauſe, becauſe it containeth the firſt beginning of the Church of Corinthus, which, as it was famous for good cauſes, both bicauſe of the multitude of men, &amp; alſo becauſe of the excellent gifts beſtowed vpon them, ſo there were in it groſſe and ſhamefull vices. Furthermore Luke ſheweth in this place with what great labor, and how hardly Paul did winne the ſame to Chriſt. It is well knowne what a rich Cittie Corinthus was by reaſon of the noble mart, how populous, how greatly giuen to pleaſure. And the old prouerbe doth teſtifie that it was ſumptuous and ful of riot: All men cannot goe to Corinthus. When Paul entreth the ſame, what hope I pray you can he conceiue? He is a ſimple man vnknowne, hauing no e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquence or pomp, ſhewing no wealth or power. In that that huge gulph doth not ſwallow vp his confidence and deſire which he had to ſpreade abroad the Goſpel, by this we gather that hee was furniſhed with won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull power of the Spirite of God: and alſo that God wrought by his hand after a heauenly maner and not after any humane maner. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he boaſteth not without cauſe that the Corinthians are the ſeale of his Apoſtleſhip. For they be twiſe blind,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 9.2.</note> who doe not acknowledge that the glory of God did more plainely appeare in ſuch a ſimple &amp; baſe kind of dealing: and he himſelf ſhewed no ſmal token of inuincible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie, when being vexed with the mockes of all men (as the proude did contemne him) he did notwithſtanding ſtay himſelfe vppon Gods helpe alone. But it is worth the labour to note all the circumſtances, as Luke ſetteth downe the ſame in order.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>A Iew called Aquila.</hi> This was no ſmall triall in that Paule findeth none at Corinthus to lodge him, ſaue Aquila who had bin twiſe exiled. For being borne in Pontus, he forſooke his countrie and ſailed ouer the ſea that he might dwell at Rome. Hee was compelled to depart thence againe by the commandement of Claudius Caeſar. Though the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiouſnes of the Citie was ſuch, the plentie ſo great, the ſituation ſo pleaſant, and there were alſo ſo many Iewes there: yet Paul founde no more fit hoaſt than a man that had bin baniſhed out of his owne coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie and alſo out of another ſoile. If we compare the great fruite which enſued immediatly vpon his preaching, with ſuch a baſe entrance, the power of the Spirit of God ſhall plainly appeare. Alſo we may ſee howe the Lord by his ſingular counſell turneth thoſe things to his glorie and the ſaluation of the godly, which ſeeme contrary to the fleſh, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happie. Nothing is more miſerable than exile according to the ſenſe of the fleſh. But it was farre better for Aquila to be Paul his companion, than to be in the higheſt office either at Rome or in his countrie. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this happie calamitie of Aquila doth teach vs, that the Lord doeth often better prouide for vs, when he doeth ſharply puniſh vs, than if he ſhould moſt gently intreat vs: and when he toſſeth vs to and fro in moſt extreme exile, that he may bring vs vnto the heauenly reſt.</p>
               <pb n="440" facs="tcp:7788:230"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>All Iewes to depart from Rome.</hi> The eſtate of that nation was then very miſerable, ſo that it is a wonder that they did not almoſt all depart from the worſhip of God. But this is a greater wonder that the religion wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they had bin brought vp preuailed againſt Caeſars tyranny, and that ſo ſoone as Chriſt the ſunne of righteouſneſſe did ariſe, few were turned vnto him. Notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding I do not doubt but that the Lord ſuffered the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to paſſe through many troubles, that they might the more willingly, yea the more greedily receiue the grace of redemption offered them: but the more part became dull in their miſerie, fewe did ſubmit themſelues to be taught when the Lord did puniſh them, as did Aquila and Priſcil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la. Yet if Suetonius ſay the truth, they were expelled through hatred of the name of Chriſt, and ſo calamitie might haue more prouoked and angred a great part becauſe they were wrongfully accuſed for that reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion which they did deteſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>They were of the ſame trade.</hi> This place teacheth that Paul before he came to Corinthus was wont to worke with his hands: and that not vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on pleaſure, but that he might get his liuing with his handyworke. It is not knowne where hee firſt learned his occupation: notwithſtanding it appeareth by his owne teſtimony that he wrought principally at Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus.<note place="margin">1. Co. 9.12.15.</note> And he ſheweth a reaſon, becauſe the falſe Apoſtles taught freely without taking any thing, that they might craftily creepe in, therefore the holy man would not giue place to them in that point, leaſt he ſhould cauſe the Goſpel of Chriſt to be euill ſpoken off. But we may eaſily ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of this place, that whitherſoeuer he came,) vntill he was occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied in the continual labour of teaching) he wrought of his occupation, that he might get his liuing. When Chryſoſtome ſaith that Paul was a cordiner, he doth no whit diſſent from Luke, becauſe they were wont at that time to make tents of skinnes.</p>
               <p n="4">4 <hi>He diſputed in the ſynagogue.</hi> It is a wonder how that crope in which is in the Latine bookes, that Paul put in the name of Chriſt: vnleſſe it were becauſe ſome reader woulde ſupply the want of the generall ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. For Luke ſetteth downe two things in this place: to wit, that Paul diſputed among the Iewes: ſecondly that he began more plainly to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe Chriſt after that Silas and Timotheus were come. And though it be likely that he began to ſpeake of Chriſt euen at the firſt entrance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he could not omit the principall point of the heauenly doctrine: yet that doeth not hinder but that he might vſe ſome other manner of diſputation. Therefore I take <hi>pithein,</hi> that is to perſwade, for to induce by litle and litle. For in my iudgement Luke doth ſignifie, that foraſmuch as the Iewes did handle the Law coldly and fooliſhly, Paul ſpake of the corrupt &amp; wicked nature of man, of the neceſſitie of grace, of the redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer which was promiſed, of the means to obtain ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that he might awake them: for this is a fit and briefe preparation vnto Chriſt. Againe whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſaith that he was forced in ſpirit to teach that Ieſus was Chriſt, his meaning is, that he was inforced with greater veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy, to intreat &amp; ſpeak of Chriſt freely &amp; openly. So that we ſee that Paul did not vtter al things at one time: but he tempered his doctrin, as occaſion did ſerue.
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:7788:230"/> And becauſe like moderation is profitable at this day, it is conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for faithful teachers wiſely to conſider where to begin, leaſt a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous and confuſed order do hinder the proceeding of doctrin. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore though there wer feruentneſſe enough in Paul, yet is it no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenient thing that he was made more couragious by ſom new help: not that hee was incouraged by ſhame or the hope which he repoſed in his felowes, but becauſe hee conſidered that this helpe was ſent him, as it were from heauen. But this forcing in the Spirite is not taken for a violent or externall impulſion (as they ſay) as thoſe which were called Phaebades and frantike men were wont to be carried away with diueliſh madneſſe: but there was more feruentneſſe added vnto the wonted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration of the Spirit, which was in Paul, ſo that hee was moued with new power of God, and yet did he of his owne accord follow the Spirite as his guide. Whereas Paul did teſtifie that Ieſus is Chriſte, I expounde it thus: when he had throughly taught the Iewes concerning the office of the Redeemer, he declared by teſtimonies of ſcripture that this is hee which was to be hoped for: becauſe all thoſe things agree to him, which the law and the prophets attribute to Chriſt. Therefore he did not ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply affirm, but vſing a ſolemne teſtification, he proued Ieſus the ſonne of Mary to be that Chriſt, who ſhould be the mediatour betweene God &amp; men, that he might reſtore the worlde from deſtruction to life.</p>

And we muſt note the ſpeech: that they goe from gainſaying vnto blaſpheming and railing. For it falleth out thus for the moſt part, when men take to themſelues ſuch libertie, that the diuell doth inflame them by little &amp; little vnto greater madneſſe. For which cauſe wee muſt take good heede, that no wicked luſt or deſire, prouoke vs to reſiſt the truth: &amp; aboue all let that horrible iudgement terrifie vs, which the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of god thundereth out by the mouth of Paul againſt al rebels, For vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly in that Paul by ſhaking his garments gaue ſome token of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation,
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:7788:231" rendition="simple:additions"/> it was no humane or priuate indignation, but zeale kindled by God in his heart: yea God raiſed him vp to be a preacher &amp; ſetter forth of his vengeance, to the end the enemies of the worde might know that they ſhould not eſcape ſcotfree for their ſtubbornneſſe. We ſpake ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what touching this ſigne of execration or curſing in the 13. chapter. Let the Readers repair thither. The ſumme is, that God is ſorer diſpleaſed with contempt of his word,<note place="margin">Ch. 13.51.</note> then with any wickedneſſe. And ſurely men be quite paſt hope, when they tread vnder foote, or driue from them the only remedie of all euils and maladies. Now as the Lorde cannot abyde rebellio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againſt his word, ſo it ought to ſting &amp; netle vs fulſore. My mea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning is this, that when the wicked enter combate with God, &amp; as it were arme themſelues to reſiſt, we are called as it were by the heauenly trum<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pet, vnto the conflict: becauſe there is nothing more filthy then that the wicked ſhould mocke God to his face, whiles we ſay nothing, and that they ſhould euen break out into reproches and blaſphemies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Your blood.</hi> He denounceth to them vengeance: becauſe they be with out excuſe. For they can ſhift no part of their fault from themſelues after that deſpiſing the calling of God, they haue indeuoured to put out the light of life. Therfore ſeeing they beare the blame of their owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, he doth alſo affirme that they ſhall be puniſhed. And in ſaying that he is cleane, he teſtifieth that he hath done his dutie: it is wel kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen what the Lorde giueth all his miniſters in charge in Ezechiel. If thou ſhew not vnto the wicked that hee may conuert,<note place="margin">Eze. 3.18.</note> I will require his blood at thy hand. Therefore Paul (becauſe hee did what hee coulde to bring the Iewes to repentance) doth acquit himſelf of all giltines. And by theſe wordes teachers are warned that vnleſſe they will bee giltie of blood before the Lorde, they muſt doe what in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lyeth to bring thoſe which goe aſtray into the way, and that they ſuffer nothing to periſh through ignorance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I will go vnto the Gentiles.</hi> Though the Iewes had ſhewed themſelues to be moſt readie to be taught, yet ought Paul to haue emploied himſelf to teach the Gentiles, whoſe apoſtle and miniſter he was made: but here he expreſſeth the paſſage whereby he withdrew himſelfe from the ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne Iewes, for all. For he obſerued this courſe in teaching, that begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with the Iewes, he might couple the Gentiles with them in the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie of faith: and ſo might make of both togeather one bodie of the church. When ther remained no hope to do any good amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the Iewes, then the Gentiles only remained. Therefore the ſenſe is this, that they muſt be depriued of their own inheritance, that it may bee giuen to the Gentiles: and ſo be wounded, partly, that being ſtrike<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with feare, yea, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing caſt down, they might come to ſoundnes of minde: partly that the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation or ſtriuing of the Gentiles might prick them forward vnto re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. But becauſe they were vncurable, reproche and ſhame ſerued for this purpoſe only to bring them into deſpaire.</p>
               <p n="7">7 <hi>Departing thence.</hi> Paul did not change his lodging, whiche hee had with Priſcilla and Aquila, becauſe hee was wearie of theyr compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie: but that he might more familiarly inſinuate himſelfe and come in
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:7788:231"/> fauour with the gentiles. For I ſuſpect that this Iuſtus, of whom Luke maketh mention, was rather a gentile then a Iew. Neither doth the nighnes of the Sinagogue any whit hinder: for the Iewes were ſcatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red abroade, ſo that they had no certaine place of the Citie to dwell in. Yea it ſeemeth that Paule did make choyſe of the houſe which did ioyne to the Synagogue, that hee might the more nettle the Iewes. The title and commendation aſcribed to luſtus, confirmeth this opinion, for it is ſaid that he was a worſhipper of God. For thogh the Iewes had not ſincere religion: yet becauſe they did al profeſſe the worſhip of God, it might haue ſeemed that godlines took place co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly in all the whole nation. But becauſe it was a rare matter among the gentiles to worſhip God: if any drewe neere vnto true godlines, he hath this ſinguler teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie giuen him, which is ſet againſt idolatrie. Alſo I thinke that the Corinthians, of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Luke ſpeaketh ſhortly after, were gentiles. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theles leaſt we ſhould thinke that Paule his labour was altogether fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, which he beſtowed among the Iewes, Luke reckoneth vp two of them which beleeued, Criſpus and Soſthenes. Of whom Paul himſelfe ſpeaketh in the firſt Chapt. of the firſt Epiſt. to the Corinths.<note place="margin">1.

                  <hi>9 And the Lord ſaid.</hi> Though the fruite of Pauls doctrine (in that he gained ſome daily to Chriſt) might haue incouraged him to go forward, yet is the heauenly Oracle added for his farther confirmation. Whence we gather that there were great cumbates ſet before him, and that hee was ſore toſſed diuers ways. For the Lord did neuer without cauſe powre out his oracles: neither was it an ordinary thing with Paule to haue viſions: but the Lorde vſed this kinde of remedy, when neceſſitie did ſo require: and the thing it ſelfe doth ſhewe, that there laide vppon the holy man a great weight of buſineſſe, vnder which he might not onely ſweat, but almoſt faint, vnleſſe he had been ſet on foot again &amp; refreſhed with ſome new help. And it is not without cauſe that hee ſaieth that his comming was baſe &amp; contemptible, &amp; that he was conuerſaunt there in fear &amp; trembling. For mine owne part I think thus,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 2.3. Numb. 12.6</note> that the wonderfull power of the Spirit wherewith Paul was indued before, was holpen with the oracle. Furthermore for as much as the Scripture diſtinguiſheth vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions from dreames as it appeareth by the twelft chapter of the book of Numbers: Luke meaneth by this worde <hi>viſion,</hi> that when Paul was in a traunce he ſaw a certaine ſhape or forme, whereby hee knewe that God was preſent with him, Aſſuredly it is not to be doubted but that God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared by ſome ſigne.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Feare not.</hi> This exhortation ſheweth that Paule had cauſe of feare miniſtred vnto him: for it had been a ſuperfluous thing to correct feare, or to will him not to feare w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 chunk">

               <p>Furthermore when the Lord (to the end he may haue his ſeruaunt to doe his duetie faithfullie and ſtoutlie) beginneth with reſtraining feare: by this we gather that nothing is more contrarie to the pure and free preaching of the goſpel, then the ſtraites of a faint heart. And ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly experience doth ſhew that none are faithfull &amp; couragious miniſters of the word, whom this fault doth hinder: and that thoſe onelie are rightly prepared and addreſſed to teach, to whom it is graunted with boldnes and courage of heart to ouercome all manner danger. In which reſpect hee writeth to Timothie, that the ſpirite of feare is not giuen to the preachers of the Goſpel: but of power, and loue, and ſobrietie. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt note the connection of wordes, Feare not but ſpeak, which is all one,<note place="margin">2. Tim. 1.7.</note> as if he ſhould haue ſaid, Let not feare let thee to ſpeake. And becauſe feare doth not onely make vs altogether without tongue, but doth ſo binde vs that we cannot purely and freely ſpeake that which is needful. Chriſt touched both briefly: Speake (ſaith he) and hold not thy peace: that is, ſpeake not with halfe thy mouth, as it is in the common prouerbe. But in theſe words there is preſcribed to the miniſters of the worde of God a common rule that they expound and lay open plainely and without color or diſſimulation, whatſoeuer the Lord wil haue made knowne to his Church: yea let them keepe backe nothing which may make for the edifying or increaſe of Gods Church.</p>
               <p n="10">10 <hi>Becauſe I am.</hi> This is the former reaſon why Paul hauing ſubdued feare, muſt manfully and ſtoutly do his duetie, becauſe he hath God on his ſide.<note place="margin">Pſal. 23.4.</note> Whereto anſwereth the reioycing of Dauid, If I ſhall walke in the midſt of the ſhadow of death I ſhall feare none ill: becauſe thou art with me.<note place="margin">Pſal. 27.3.</note> Again, If tentes be pitched about me &amp;c. The queſtion is whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he did not perceiue that God was preſent with him elſewhere: as he had had experience of his helpe in diuerſe places. For the promiſe is generall,<note place="margin">Mat. 28.20.</note> I am with you vntil the ende of the world. Neither is it lawfull for vs to miſtruſt, ſo often as we obey his calling, but that he wil be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with vs. But it is an vſuall thing with the Lorde to apply that vnto certaine kinds, when the matter ſo requireth, which he hath promiſed to do in al affaires, &amp; we know that when we come to the puſh, then are we moſt deſirous of helpe. Moreouer, theſe two members are ioyned to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gether, I am with thee, &amp; no man ſhal hurt thee. For it falleth out ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times that God doth helpe vs, and yet doth he, to looke too, ſuffer vs to be oppreſſed: as he forſook not Paull euen in the midſt of death, &amp; here he promiſeth the peculiar defence of his hand, whereby he ſhall be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued from the violence of his enemies. But the queſtion is, whether Paul needed any ſuch confirmation, who ought to haue been willing to enter all maner dangers. For what if he had been to ſuffer death: ſhould he therefore haue fainted through feare? I anſwere, that if at any time God pronounce that his ſeruaunts ſhall be ſafe for a time, that doth no whit hinder, but that they may prepare themſelues to ſuffer death vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly: but as wee diſtinguiſh between profitable and neceſſarie: ſo wee muſt note that there be ſome promiſes, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="445" facs="tcp:7788:232"/> it is expedient ſo to be: which though they be taken away (becauſe the grace of God doth neuertheleſſe remaine firme and ſure) the faith of the godly doth not faile. After this ſort Paul is commanded not to fear becauſe his enemies ſhall not touch him, and if ſo be he ſhould haue bin oppreſſed, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> then with their violence, yet wold he not haue bin afraid: but god would haue his boldneſſe and courage to encreaſe euen by this, becauſe he ſhould be without danger, If at any time the Lord bear with vs ſo farre foorth, we are not to deſpice ſuch a comfort of our infirmitie, in the meane ſeaſon let this be ſufficient for vs to tread vnder foote all corrupt feare of the fleſh: that ſo long as we fight vnder his banner, wee cannot be forſaken of him. And when it is ſaid, No man ſhall gainſtande thee to doe thee hurt, the Lorde doth not meane that he ſhall bee free from violence and tumult, whom the Iewes did afterwarde deadlilie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uade: but his meaning is that their attempts ſhall bee fruſtrate: becauſe the Lord had determined to deliuer him out of their handes. Therefore we muſt fight ſtoutly that we may win the field.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Becauſe I haue much people.</hi> The ſecond reaſon why he ſhuld take a good heart, is, becauſe the Lord wil raiſe vp a great and populous church ther, though it be to be douted whether this me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber depend vpon that which goeth next before: for the text will run fitly thus, becauſe the Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of Paul to gather together a great church, he wold not ſuffer the enemies to interrupt the courſe of his labors, as if he ſhuld haue ſaid, I will helpe thee, that thou mayſt not faile my people whoſe miniſter I haue appointed thee to bee. I doe willingly embrace this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, that diuers reaſons are not inferred which are to be read apart: but that they be ſo diſtinguiſhed that they agree together. Furthermore the Lord calleth thoſe his people, who though they might then for good cauſes be counted ſtrangers: yet becauſe they were written in the book of life, and were foorthwith to be admitted into his familie, they haue this title giuen them not vnproperly. For we know that many ſheep wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der without the flock for a time, as the ſheep haue many wolues among them. Therefore whom the Lord determined ſhortly after to gather to himſelf, thoſe doth he take for his people in reſpect of their future faith. But let vs remember that thoſe are ingraffed into the body of Chriſte, who appertaine vnto the ſame by the eternall adoption of God:<note place="margin">Iohn. 17.6.</note> as it is written, Thine they were, and thou gaueſt them mee.</p>

               <p n="12">12 <hi>When Gallio.</hi> Either the change of the deputie did incourage the Iewes, to wax more proud and inſolent: as froward men vſe to abuſe new things, that they may procure ſome tumult: or els hoping that the iudge would fauour them, they brake the peace and ſilence at a ſodain, which had continued one whole yeere. And the ſumme of the accuſation is, that Paul went about to bring in a falſe kind of worſhip, contrary to the law. Now the queſtion is, whether they ſpake of the lawe of Moſes, or of the rites vſed in the empire of Rome. Becauſe this latter thing ſeemeth to me to be cold, I do rather receiue that, that they burdened Paul with this crime, that he brake &amp; altered the worſhip preſcribed in the law of God, &amp; that to the end they might hit him in the teeth with noueltie or innouation. And ſurely Paul had bin worthy to haue bin condemned, if he had gon about any ſuch thing: but for aſmuch as it is moſt certain that they did trecherouſly &amp; wickedly ſlander the holy ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they indeuoured to couer an euill cauſe with an honeſt excuſe. We know how ſtraitly the Lord commandeth in the law, how he wil haue his ſeruants to worſhip him. Therefore to depart from that rule is ſacrilege. But foraſmuch as, Paul neuer meant to adde too, or take away any thing from the law, he is vniuſtly accuſed of this fault. Whence we gather, that thogh the faith ful behaue themſelues neuer ſo vprightly &amp; blameleſly, yet can they not eſcape falſe &amp; ſlanderous reports vntil they be admitted to purge them ſelues. But Paul was not only vnworthily and falſly ſlandered by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries: but when he would haue refuted their impudencie &amp; falſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portes, his mouth was ſtopt by the deputie. Therfore he was inforced to depart fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the iudgement ſeat without defending himſelfe. And Gallio refuſeth to heare the cauſe, not for any euill will hee bare to Paul, but becauſe it was not agreeable to the office of the deputie to giue iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment concerning the religion of euery prouince. For though the Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s could not enforce the nations which were ſubiect to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to obſerue their rites: yet leaſt they ſhould ſeem to allow that which they did tollerate, they forbade their magiſtrates to meddle with this part of iuriſdiction. Here we ſee what the ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of true godlines doth, in ſetting in order the ſtate of euery common-wealth and dominion. All men confeſſe, that this is the principall thing, that true religion bee in force and floriſhe.

But ſeing that the Romanes did obſerue their rites on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly through pride &amp; ſtubbornnes, &amp; ſeeing they had no certainety where there was no trueth, they thought that this was the beſt way they could take, if they ſhuld graunt libertie to thoſe who dwelt in the prouinces to liue as the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> luſted.

Yet Galio is not worthy to be excuſed, who doth mock the holy law of god togither with their curioſity.

And what fury did inforce the Grecians to run headlong vpon him, ſaue only becauſe it is alotted to all the children of God to haue the world ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them and offended with them &amp; their cauſe, though vnknowne? wherefore there is no cauſe why ſuch vniuſt dealing ſhould trouble vs at this day, when wee ſee the miſerable church oppugned on euerie ſide.</p>

The Romans could haue wiſhed that the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the true God had bin buried. And therfore when as it was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for them to vowe their vowes, and to pay them to all the Idols of
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:7788:234"/> Aſia and Grecia: it was a deadly fact to do ſacrifice to the god of Iſrael. Finally, in the common liberty of al manner ſuperſtition, only true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion was accepted. This is the cauſe that Gallio winketh at the iniurie done to Soſthenes. He profeſſed of late that he would puniſh iniuries if anye were done: now he ſuffereth a guiltleſſe man to be beaten be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the iudgement ſeate. Whence commeth this ſufferance, ſaue onely becauſe he did in heart deſire that the Iewes might one ſlea another, that their religion might be put out with them.

               <p>Therefore he did ſheare his head for no other cauſe, ſaue onely that he might apply himſelfe to the Iewes who were as yet ignorant, &amp; not throughly taught: as he doth teſtifie that he tooke vpon him the volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary obſeruing of the law, from which he was freed, that hee might gain thoſe who wer vnder the law. If any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> obiect that it was not lawfull for him to make ſemblance of a vow, which he had not made from his hart: we may eaſily anſwere,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 9.20</note> that as touching the ſubſtaunce of purifiyng hee did not diſſemble: and that he vſed the ceremonie which was as yet free: not as if God did require ſuch worſhip, but that he might ſomwhat bear with the ignorant. Therfore the Papiſts are ridiculous when they ſet fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hence an example of making vowes. Paul was moued with no religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to make his vow: but theſe men place a feigned worſhip of God in vowes. Reſpect of time inforced Paul to keepe the rites of the lawe: theſe men doe nothing els but intangle in ſuperſtition the church of Chriſt, which was ſet free long agoe. For it is one thing to bring in vſe again old cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies vſed long ago, and another to tollerate the ſame beeing as yet vſed, vntill ſuch time as they may by little and little grow out of vſe. I o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that the Papiſts in vaine and fooliſhly compare the ſhauing of their Prieſtes with the ſigne of purifying, whiche God had allowed in the Lawe. But becauſe we need not ſtande any longer to refute them, let this one thing ſuffice vs: that Paul bound himſelfe with a vowe that he might bryng thoſe which were weake to Chriſte, at leaſt that he might not offend them, which vowe hee knewe was of no importaunce before God.</p>
               <p n="19">19 <hi>Entring into the Synagogue.</hi> In that hee ſhooke his garment at Corinthus, it was done for that cauſe (as this place teacheth) that hee might caſt off the whole nation: but only ſuch as hee had alreadie tryed to be of deſperate obſtinacie. Now he commeth afreſh vnto the Epheſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that he might trie whether he could find any more obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g them. Furthermore, it is a wonder, that ſeeing it appeareth by Luke his report, that he was heard more patiently in this Synagogue then in any other place, &amp; alſo that he was requeſted to tarry, he did not grant their requeſt. He<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce we may eaſily gather that which I ſaid before, that he had
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:7788:235" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſome great cauſe to go vp to Ieruſalem in haſt. Alſo he himſelf ſheweth that he muſt make haſt, ſaying, I muſt keepe the feaſt which is at hande at Ieruſalem. Neither is it to be doubted but that after he had ſet things in good order there, he departed with their good leaue: and we may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of Luke his wordes that they did admit his excuſe, leaſt the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe ſhould offend them. And this is worth the noting, that when bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hope to doe good is offered vs, then wee were wont to haue, wee are drawen vnto diuers affaires as it were by the hand of God: that we may learne to giue ouer our ſelues to be gouerned at his pleaſure.</p>

                  <hi>The feaſt.</hi> That which I ſaid of late touching the vow, doth alſo apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnto the feaſt day. For Paul meant not to do thereby any dutie of godlineſſe to God: but to be at the aſſembly, wherein he might do more good then at any other time of the yere. For the Epiſtle to the Galathi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans doth ſufficiently teſtifie what accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t he made of difference of daies. And we muſt note that he maketh no promiſe touching his return,<note place="margin">Gal. 4.10.</note> with out vſing this exception, if it pleaſe the Lord. We do all confeſſe that we be not able to ſtirre one finger without his direction: but becauſe there reigneth in men ſo great arrogancie euery where, that they dare deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine any thing (paſſing ouer God) not onely for the time to come, but alſo for many yeres: wee muſt oftentimes thinke vpon this reuerence and ſobrietie, that wee may learne to make our counſels ſubiect to the will and prouidence of God: leaſt if we delyberate and take counſell as thoſe vſe to doe, who thinke that they haue fortune at their commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, we be iuſtly puniſhed for our raſhneſſe. And though ther be not ſo great religion in wordes, but that we may at our pleaſure ſay that we wil do this or that: yet is it good to accuſtome our ſelues to vſe certain formes in our ſpeeches, that they may put vs in mind that God doth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect all our doings.</p>

Moreouer, he declareth that his iourney in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne was not idle or barren, in that he ſaith that he ſtrengthened al the diſciples: vndoubtedly not without great paines taking, becauſe he was enforced to goe hither and thither, and oft to turne out of his way for this word <hi>cathexes</hi> doth ſignifie a continuall courſe.

               <p n="24">24 <hi>A certaine Iew.</hi> This ought for good cauſes to be aſcribed to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence of God, in that whiles Paul is inforced to depart from Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, Apollos commeth in his place, to ſupplie his abſence. And it is very expedient to know the beginning of this man of what ſort it was, for as much as he was alſo Paul his ſucceſſour among the Corinthians, &amp; did behaue himſelfe ſo excellently, and did his faithful indeuour, and tooke great paines, ſo that Paul commendeth him honorably as a ſingular fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe in office. I haue planted (ſaith he) Apollo hath watered.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 3.6.4.6.</note> Alſo theſe things haue I figuratiuely appointed vnto my ſelf and Apollos.

                  </gap> &amp; curious cunning, plainly to lay open the matter he hath in hand. Paul was without eloquence: the Lord wold haue the chiefe Apoſtle to want this vertue, to the end the power of the ſpirit might appeare more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in his rude &amp; homely ſpeach. And yet was he furniſhed with ſuch eloque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce as was ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to ſet forth the name of Chriſt, &amp; to maintain the doctrine of ſaluation. But as the diſtribution of the gifts of the ſpirit is diuers &amp; manifold, Paul his infa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy, that I may ſo cal it, did no whit let but that the Lord might chooſe to himſelf eloquent miniſters. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, leaſt any man ſhuld think that Apollo his eloquence was profane or vaine, Luke ſaith that it was ioined with great power: namely, that he was mighty in the ſcriptures. Which I expound thus, that he was not onely well and ſoundly exerciſed in the ſcriptures: but that he had the force and efficacye thereof, that beyng armed with them, hee did in all conflictes get the vpper hande. And this (in my iudgement) is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the prayſe of the Scripture then of manne, that it hath ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent force both to defend the trueth, and alſo to refute the ſubtiltie of Satan.</p>
               <p n="25">25 <hi>He was inſtructed.</hi> That which Luke addeth ſhortly after, ſeemeth
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:7788:236"/> not to agree with this comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dation, to wit, that he knew only the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme of Iohn. But this later member is added by way of correction. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe theſe two agree very well together: that he vnderſtood the doctrine of the Goſpel, becauſe he both knewe that the Redeemer was giuen to the worlde, and alſo was well and ſincerely inſtructed concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the grace of reconciliation: and yet had he beene trayned vp on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the principles of the Goſpel, ſo much as coulde be had out of Iohn his inſtitution.<note place="margin">Luke. 1.76. Ib. 16. &amp; 17.</note> For we knowe that Iohn was in the middeſt betweene Chriſt and the prophets: and of his office doth both his father Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rias intreate in his ſongue, and alſo the Angell out of the prophecye of Malachie. Surely ſeeyng that hee carried the light before Chriſte, and did highly extoll his power, his Diſciples are for good cauſes ſaide to haue had knowledge of Chriſte. Moreouer, the ſpeeche is woorth the noting, that, He knewe the Baptiſme of Iohn. For thence we gather the true vſe of the Sacramentes: to wit, that they enter vs in ſome certaine kind of doctrine, or that they eſtabliſh that faith which wee haue imbraced. Surely it is wickedneſſe and impious profanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to pull them away from doctrine. Wherefore that the Sacraments may bee rightly adminiſtred, the voyce of the heauenly doctrine muſt ſounde there. For what is the Baptiſme of Iohn? Luke comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth all his miniſterye vnder this woorde: not onelie becauſe doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine is annexed vnto Baptiſme, but alſo becauſe it is the foundation and head thereof, without which it ſhould be a vaine and dead ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Being feruent in ſpirite he ſpake.</hi> Apollos hath another commendation giuen him in theſe wordes, that he was inflamed with an holie zeale to teache.

For wee ſee that ſome learned men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſlouthful: otherſome (which is worſe) become ambitious: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome (which is of al, the worſt) trouble the church with contention and brawling. Therefore that doctrine ſhalbe vnſauery, which is not ioyned with zeal. But let vs remember that Luke putteth the knowledge of the Scripture in the firſt place, which muſt be the moderation of zeale, for we know that many are feruent without conſideration; as the Iewes did rage againſt the goſpel, by reaſon of a peruerſe affection which they did beare toward the lawe: and euen at this day we ſee how whotte the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes bee, who are carried headlong with furious violence, being pric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked forward with an opinion vnaduiſedly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiued. Therfore let know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge be preſent that it may gouern zeale. And now it is ſaid that zeale was the cauſe of diligence, becauſe Apollos gaue himſelfe to teach dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently. But and if that man being not yet throughly &amp; perfectly taught in the Goſpel, did preach Chriſt ſo diligently and freely: what excuſe doe thoſe men hope to haue, who know that more perfectly and fullie, which he knew not as yet, if they doe not indeuour ſo muche as in them lieth, to further and aduaunce the kingdome of Chriſt. Luke doth at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute zeale to the ſpirite therefore, becauſe it is a rare and peculiar
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:7788:236" rendition="simple:additions"/> gift: neither doe I ſo expound it that Apollos was mooued and pricked forward with the inſtinct of his mind, but by motion of the holy Spirite.</p>
               <p n="26">26 <hi>Whom when Priſcilla.</hi> By this it appeareth how farre Priſcilla and Aquila were from the loue themſelues, and from enuying another mans vertue, in that they deliuer thoſe things familiarly and priuately to an eloquent man, which he may afterward vtter publikely. They ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled not in the ſame grace, wherein hee did excell, and peraduenture they might haue been deſpiſed in the congregation. Moreouer they moſt diligently helpe him whom they ſee better furniſhed as well with eloquence as the vſe of the ſcripture: ſo that they keepe ſilence, and he alone is heard.</p>
               <p>Againe, this was no ſmall modeſtie which was in Apollos in that hee doeth ſuffer himſelfe to bee taught and inſtructed not only in an handi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craftsman, but alſo by a woman. Hee was mightie in the ſcripture, and did ſurpaſſe them: but as touching the acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pliſhment of the kingdome of Chriſt, thoſe doe polliſh and trim him who might ſeeme to bee ſcarce fit miniſters. Alſo we ſee that at that time women were not ſo ignorant of the word of God as the Papiſtes will haue them: foraſmuch as wee ſee that one of the chiefe teachers of the Churche was inſtructed by a woman. Notwithſtanding wee muſt remember that Priſcilla did exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute this function of teaching at home in her owne houſe, that ſhee might not ouerthrowe the order preſcribed by God and nature.</p>
               <p n="27">27 <hi>When he was determined.</hi> Luke doth not expreſſe for what cauſe Apollos would goe to Achaia. Notwithſtanding wee gather out of the text that he was not allured with any priuate commoditie, but becauſe more plentifull frute in ſpreading abroade the Goſpell did ſhewe it ſelfe there: becauſe the brethren did more encourage him with their exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and did ſpurre him when hee did alreadie runne. Which they would not haue done, vnleſſe it had been for the common profite of the Church. For it had been an abſurd thing to intreate a man to depart to another place, whoſe faithfull induſtrie they alreadie vſed, and did knowe that they ſhould haue neede of him afterward, vnleſſe there had been ſom better recompence offered. And I take it that the brethren of Epheſus wrote to thoſe of Achaia, not onely that they ſhoulde prouide lodging for the man, but alſo that they ſhoulde ſuffer him to teache. This is holy commendation in deede, when wee ſtudie to extoll euerie good man with our teſtimonie and conſent: leaſt the giftes of the holie ghoſt, which he hath giuen to euery man for the edifiyng of the church, lie buried.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When he came.</hi> The brethren forſawe this, who had alreadie had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience thereof, when they exhorted him to addreſſe himſelfe to that iourney, which he had alreadie in minde conceiued. And whereas it is ſaide that he helped the faithfull much, wee may take it two wayes: ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that he helped thoſe who were not ſo well furniſhed, and that hee did ſupport them to beat downe the pride of their enemies: for euery man was not able to haue weapon in readineſſe, to vndertake a harde combate againſt old enemies, who woulde neuer haue yeelded vnleſſe
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:7788:237"/> they had been inforced: or that hee aided them leaſt their faith ſhoulde faile being ſhaken with the gainſaying of the enemies: which thing doth oftentimes befall the weake. I take it that they wer holpen both waies: that hauing a skilfull and practiſed captaine, they gate the victorie in the conflict. Secondly, that their faith was fortified with a new prop, that it might be without danger of wauering Furthermore Luke ſemeth to note that the brethren were holpen with this ſtoutneſſe and conſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, when as he ſayth, that he diſputed publikely with the Iewes. For this was a ſigne of zeale and boldneſſe, not to flie the light. Whereas in the ende of the ſentence, theſe wordes are vſed, through grace: it doth ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther agree with the worde going before, they beleeued: or els it muſt be referred vnto the helpe wherewith he helped the brethren. The former interpretation is nothing hard. For the meaning thereof ſhall be this, that the faithful were illuminate by the grace of God, that they might beleeue as if he had ſaid: The brethren who were alredie called by the benefite of God vnto faith, were furthered. Yet the other text ſeemeth to agree better, that Apollos in imparting that grace which hee had receiued, with the brethren, did helpe them. So that, through grace, ſhall import as muche, as according to the meaſure of the grace recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.</p>
               <p n="28">28 <hi>Hee ouercame the Iewes.</hi> By this it appeareth to what vſe that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie which Apollos had (in that he was mighty in the holy ſcriptures) did ſerue: to wit, becauſe he had a ſtrong and forcible proof to reproue and ouercome the enemies withall. Alſo the ſtate of the diſputation is briefly ſet downe, that Ieſus is Chriſte. For this was out of queſtion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Iewes, that Chriſte was promiſed to bee the deliuerer: but it was a hard matter to perſwade the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that Ieſus the ſon of Mary was this Chriſt through whom ſaluation was offered. Therefore it was expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for Apollos ſo to diſpute concerning the office of Chriſte that hee might proue that the teſtimonies of the Scripture were fulfilled in the ſonne of Mary: and that hee might thereby gather that hee was Chriſte.</p>
               <p>Alſo this place doth teſtifie, that the ſcripture is profitable not onely to teach, but alſo to breake the obſtinacie of thoſe, which doe not obey and followe willingly. For our faith ſhould not otherwiſe bee firme e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, vnleſſe there were an euident demonſtration extaunt there of thoſe thinges, which are neceſſarie to be knowen for ſaluation. Surely if the lawe and the prophetes had ſo great light, that Apollos did thereby proue manifeſtly that Ieſus is Chriſte, as if he did point out the matter with his finger: the adding of the Goſpel muſte bring this to paſſe at leaſt, that the perfect knowledge of Chriſte may bee fet from the whole ſcripture.</p>
               <p>Wherfore it is deteſtable blaſphemie againſt God in that the papiſts ſay, that the ſcripture is darke and doubtfull. For to what end ſhould god haue ſpoken vnleſſe the plaine &amp; inuincible truth ſhould ſhew it ſelfe in his words? And wheras they infer, that we muſt ſtand to the authority of the church, &amp; they are not to diſpute with heretiks out of the ſcriptures:
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:7788:237"/> their cauil is ſufficiently refuted by Luke. For ſeeing there was nothing more ſtubborn then the Iewes, we need not to feare but that thoſe wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons wherto Apollos truſted, and ouercame them, ſhal ſuffice vs againſt all heretikes! ſeeing that by them we get the victorie of the diuell, the prince of all errours.</p>

For if he were giuen onely to a fewe, why doth he ioine him with faith, as if they were ſo linked to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that they could not be ſeparate? Peraduenture, they were none of the common ſort: or becauſe they were an indifferent number, that is twelue. Paul demaundeth whether they were all without the giftes of the ſpirite. Notwithſtanding I thinke thus, that ſo manye Iewes were offered in preſence of the Gentiles, not by chaunce but by the counſaile of God, and that at one time beeyng Diſciples, that is, of the number of the faithfull, who did notwithſtanding confeſſe that
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:7788:238"/> they were ignorant of the principal glory of the goſpel, which was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant in ſpirituall giftes that by them Paul his miniſterie might be beautified, and ſet foorth. For it is vnlike that Apollos lefte ſo few Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples at Epheſus: and he might haue taught them better, ſithence that hee learned the waye of the Lorde perfectly of Priſcilla and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quila.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, I doe not doubt but that the brethren of whom Luke ſpake before, were other then theſe. In ſumme, when Paul ſeeth that theſe men doe profeſſe the name of Chriſt, to the end he may haue a more certaine triall of their faith, he asketh them whether they haue receiued the holy Ghoſt. For it appeareth by Paul himſelf that this was a ſigne &amp; token of the grace of God to eſtabliſh the credite of doctrine: I would know of you whether yee receiued the holy ghoſt by the workes of the law,<note place="margin">Gal. 3.2.</note> or by the hearing of faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wee knowe not whether there bee anie holie Ghoſt.</hi> Howe could it be, that men being Iewes heard nothing of the ſpirite, concerning which the prophetes ſpeake euery where, and whoſe commendations and titles are extaunt in the whole Scripture. Surely wee gather by this that Paule did neither ſpeake generally of the Spirite: and that theſe menne as they were asked, did denie that they knewe thoſe viſible graces, wherewith GOD had beautified the kingdome of his ſonne. Therefore they confeſſe that they knowe not whether God giue ſuch giftes. Therefore there is in the woorde Spirite the figure Metony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia. And this ſenſe doth that confirme, that if they had altogether denied that they knew any thing concerning the ſpirite of God, Paul woulde not haue paſſed ouer with ſilence ſuch a groſſe errour, yea an errour altogether monſtrous. When he demaundeth to what ende, or ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> they were baptiſed, hee ſheweth therewithall, that whereſoeuer Chriſt had been ſoundly and throughly preached, the viſible graces did alſo appeare, that ſuche woorſhip might be common to all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. Wherefore no maruell if Paul woonder that the faithful are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noraunt of ſuch glorie of Chriſt, which God woulde haue to bee appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant euery where at that time: and adding a correction immediatly, he telleth them, that they muſt not ſtay in thoſe rudiments which they had learned: becauſe it was Iohn his office to prepare Diſciples for Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4 <hi>Iohn truelie.</hi> Paul his admonition tended to this end, that theſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being conuict of their ignorance, might deſire to goe forward. He ſayth that Iohn preached of Chriſt who was to come. Therfore he ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t out his diſciples, that running in the courſe they might goe toward Chriſt, who was not as yet reuealed. Wherfore to the end theſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may not flatter the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, &amp; refuſe to go forward, he ſheweth that they be yet far fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the marke. For the feeling of want doth enforce men to deſire that which is as yet lacking. The ſumme commeth to this end, as if Paul had ſaid, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt was glorified, this power of his did not appeare in the world: whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was aſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded into heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he wold haue his kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to floriſh thus. Therfore the graces of the ſpirit were much leſſe ſhedde out when Iohn
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:7788:238"/> was as yet in the courſe of his ambaſſage, which doe nowe declare that Chriſt ſitteth at the right hand of his father. Foraſmuch as he had not as then openly ſhewed himſelf to be the redeemer of the world. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore know yee that you muſt goe farther forward: becauſe yee be farre from the marke. So that hee doeth plainely ſhewe that the faith of the godly who had beene taught by Iohn, ought to haue looked vnto Chriſt who was to come, leaſt theſe men ſhould ſtand ſtill being newly entred, without going any farther. And euen by this alſo are we taught that the Baptiſme of Iohn was a token of Repentance and remiſſion of ſinnes, and that our Baptiſme at this day doth not differ any thing from it, ſaue onely that Chriſt is alreadie reuealed, and in his death and reſurrection our ſaluation is made perfect: and ſo Baptiſme was brought vnto his ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: becauſe out of that fountaine of Chriſtes death and reſurrection whereof I haue ſpoken, floweth repentance, and thither is faith refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red againe that it may thence fet free righteouſnes. In ſumme, Paule ſheweth plainely that that was the baptiſme of regeneration and reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation as is ours. And becauſe both purging and newneſſe of life doeth flow from Chriſt alone, hee ſaieth that it was grounded in his faith, by which words we be alſo taught, that hereupon dependeth all the force of Baptiſme, that we lay holde vpon by faith in Chriſt whatſoeuer Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme doth figure: ſo farre off is it that the vtward ſigne doeth derogate from, or diminiſh the grace of Chriſt any iote.</p>
               <p n="5">5 <hi>When they heard theſe things.</hi> Becauſe the men of old had conceiued an opinion that the Baptiſme of Iohn and of Chriſt were diuerſe, it was no inconuenient thing for them to bee baptized againe, who were on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prepared with the Baptiſme of Iohn. But that that diuerſitie was falſely and wickedly by them beleeued, it appeareth by this, in that it was a pledge and token of the ſame adoption, and of the ſame newneſſe of life, which we haue at this day in our Baptiſme: and therefore we do not reade that Chriſt did baptiſe thoſe againe, who came from Iohn vnto him. Moreouer Chriſt receiued Baptiſme in his owne fleſh, that he might couple himſelfe with vs by that viſible ſigne: but if that feigned diuerſitie bee admitted, this ſingular benefit ſhall fall away and periſh,<note place="margin">Mat. 3.15.</note> that baptiſm is common to the ſonne of God and to vs, or that we haue all one Baptiſme with him. But this opinion needeth no long refutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe to the end they may perſwade that theſe two Baptiſmes be diuerſe, they muſt needs ſhew firſt wherein the one differeth from the other: but a moſt excellent likelyhood anſwereth on both parts, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, the agreement and conformitie of the parts, which cauſeth vs to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that it is all one Baptiſme. Nowe the queſtion is whither it were lawfull to repeat the ſame: and furious men in this our age truſting to this teſtimonie, went about to bring in Baptiſing againe. Some take Baptiſme for newe inſtitution or inſtruction: of whoſe minde I am not, becauſe as their expoſition is too much racked, ſo it ſmelleth of a ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting hole.</p>
               <p>Otherſome denie that Baptiſme was repeated: becauſe they were baptized amiſſe by ſome fooliſh enimie of Iohn. But becauſe their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:7788:239"/> hath no colour, yea the wordes of Paul doe rather import that they were the true and naturall diſciples of Iohn, and Luke doth ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourablie call them diſciples of Chriſt: I doe not ſubſcribe to this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: and yet I denie that the baptiſme of water was repeated, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the wordes of Luke import no other thing ſaue onely that they were baptized with the Spirit. Firſt it is no newe thing for the name of Baptiſme to be tranſlated vnto the Giftes of the Spirit, as we ſaw in the firſt and in the eleuenth Chapters,<note place="margin">Chap. 1.5. and 11.6.</note> where Luke ſaid, that when Chriſt promiſed to his Apoſtles to ſende the Spirite viſiblie, he called it Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme.</p>
               <p>Alſo that when the Spirit came down vpon Cornelius, Peter remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred the words of the Lorde, yee ſhalbe baptized with the holy Ghoſt. Againe wee ſee that thoſe viſible giftes are ſpoken off by name in this place, and that the ſame are giuen with baptiſme. And whereas it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth immediatly, that when he had laide his hands vpon them, the Spirit came, I take it to be added by way of interpretation: for it is a kinde of ſpeaking much vſed in the ſcripture, firſt to ſet downe a thing briefely, and afterward to make it more plaine. Therefore that which by reaſon of breuitie was ſomewhat obſcure, doth Luke better expreſſe, and lay more open, ſaying, that by laying on of handes the Spirit was giuen them. If any man obiect, that when Baptiſme is put for the giftes of the Spirit, it is not taken ſimplie, but hauing ſomewhat added to it: I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere that Luke his meaning doth ſufficiently appeare by the text: and againe, that Luke doth allude vnto the Baptiſme whereof he ſpake. And ſurely if you vnderſtande it of the externall ſigne, it ſhall be an abſurde thing that it was giuen them, without vſing any better doctrine. But and if you take it metaphorically for inſtitution, the ſpeech ſhalbe as yet harſh: and the narration ſhould not agree, that After they were taught the holy Ghoſt came downe vpon them. Furthermore as I confeſſe that this laying on of hands was a ſacrament: ſo I ſay that thoſe fel through ignorance, who did continually imitate the ſame. For ſeeing that all men agree in this, that it was a grace which was to laſt onely for a time, which was ſhewed by that ſigne: it is a peruerſe and ridiculous thing to retaine the ſigne ſythence the trueth is taken away. There is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reſpect of Baptiſme and the Supper, wherein the Lorde doeth teſtifie that thoſe giftes are laid open for vs, which the Church ſhal en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy euen vntill the ende of the worlde. Wherefore we muſt diligently and wiſely diſtinguiſh perpetuall ſacramentes from thoſe which laſt on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for a time, leaſt vaine and friuolous viſures haue a place among the Sacramentes. Whereas the men of old time did vſe laying on of hands, that they might confirme the profeſſion of faith in thoſe who were growen vp, I do not miſlike it: ſo that no man thinke that the grace of the Spirit is annexed to ſuch a ceremonie, as doeth Ierome againſt the Luciferians.</p>
               <p>But the Papiſts are worthie of no pardon, who being not content with the ancient rite, durſt thruſt in rotten and filthy annointing: that it might bee not onely a confirmation of Baptiſme but alſo a more
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:7788:239"/> worthie ſacrament, whereby they imagine that the faithfull are made perfect, who were before only half perfect: whereby thoſe are armed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the battell, who before had their ſinnes only forgiuen them. For they haue not been afraid to ſpue out theſe horrible blaſphemies.</p>

               <p n="8">8 <hi>Going into the Synagogue.</hi> By this we gather that Paul beganne with the companie of the godlie, who had alreadie giuen their names to Chriſt: Secondly, that he came into the Synagogue, that he might ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther togither into one bodie of the Churche, the reſt of the Iewes who knew not Chriſt as yet, or ar leaſt who had not as yet receyued hym. And he ſaith that Paul behaued himſelfe boldly, that we may know that hee was not therefore hearde by the ſpace of three monethes, becauſe he did craftily couer the doctrine of the Goſpel, or did inſinuate hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe by certaine darke crookes. Luke doth alſo by and by expreſſe ſome token of boldneſſe, ſhewing that he diſputed and perſwaded touching the kingdome of God. And we knowe that by this word is oftentimes noted that reſtoring which was promiſed to the fathers, and which was to be fulfilled by the comming of Chriſt. For ſeeing that without Chriſt there is an euill fauoured and confuſed ſcattering abroade and ruine of all thinges, the prophetes did attribute this not in vaine to the Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as who was to come, that it ſhould come to paſſe that he ſhoulde eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the kingdome of God in the worlde: And nowe becauſe this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome doth bring vs backe from falling and ſlyding backe, vnto the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of God, and maketh vs ſonnes of enimies: it conſiſteth firſt in the free forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, whereby God doth reconcile vs to himſelfe, and doth adopt vs to bee his people: ſecondly, in newneſſe of life, whereby hee faſhioneth and maketh vs like to his owne image. He ſaith that he diſputed and perſwaded: meaning that Paule did ſo diſpute, that he proued that with ſound reaſons, which he did alleadge: that done, he vſed the prickes of godlie exhortations, whereby he pric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked forwarde his hearers. For no profounde diſputations ſhal make vs obedient to GOD, vnleſſe we bee mooued with godlie admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p n="9">9 <hi>Seeing their hearts were hardned.</hi> We do not read that Paul was heard ſo pacie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly &amp; ſo fauorably by the Iews at any place, as at Epheſus, at his
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:7788:240" rendition="simple:additions"/> firſt comming. For where as others raiſing tumults did driue him away, he was requeſted by theſe to tarrie longer. Now after that he had inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured by the ſpace of three moneths to erect the kingdom of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, the vngodlines and ſtubbornneſſe of many doeth ſhewe it ſelfe. For Luke ſaith that they were hardened: and ſurely ſuch is the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of the heauenly doctrine, that it doeth either make the reprobate mad, or els more obſtinate: &amp; that not of nature, but accide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tally, as they ſay: bicauſe when they be vrged by the truth, their ſecret poiſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> breaketh out. Luke addeth that they ſpake euill of the way before the people. For the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temners of the goſpel do reſiſt that deadlily among others which they will not embrace. And this do they to no other end ſaue only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they be deſirous (if it can be) to haue al men partners in their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pietie. It is well knowen that euery ordinaunce is vnderſtoode by this word <hi>way:</hi> but heere it is referred vnto the goſpel of Chriſt. Now Luke ſaith that Paul departed from them, and did ſeparate the brethren, by which example we are taught, that when we haue experience of deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and vncurable ſtubbornneſſe, we muſt looſe our labour no longer. Therefore Paule admoniſheth Titus, to auoide a man that is an here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike,<note place="margin">Tit. 3.10.</note> after once or twiſe admonition. For the woord of God is vniuſtly blaſphemed, if it be caſt to dogges and ſwine. Alſo we muſt prouide for the weake, leaſt through wicked backbitings and ſlaundering of ſound doctrine, their godlines be ſubuerted. Therfore Paul did ſeparate the Diſciples, leaſt the goates ſhould with their ſtink infect the flock of ſheepe: Secondly that the pure woorſhippers of God might make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion freely.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Diſputing daily.</hi> This place ſheweth how continuall Paul his dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce was in teaching: and that they be too churliſh &amp; dainty, who are ſtreight way wearie of learning. For we ſee how few come daily, who are readie and apt to heare. And though he had a particular care for the houſhold flocke, which he had gathered as into a ſheepfold, yet he doth not ſuffer ſtraungers to be deſtitute of his induſtrie: but continuing the courſe of his diſputation, he trieth whether he can finde anie which are apt to be taught. He calleth it the ſchoole of Tyrannus, meaning no ſuch man as had gotten the gouernment of Aſia: for the Romans bare rule through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out al Aſia; but it is to be thought that the ſchole was built at the charge of one Tyrannus, and giuen to the Citie. Therefore the faithful did vſe a publike place, which bare the name of the builder, where they had their aſſemblies.</p>
               <p n="10">10 <hi>All which dwelt.</hi> Luke doth not meane that the men of Aſia came thither to heare Paul: but that the ſmel of his preaching went through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all Aſia, and that the ſeede was ſowen farre and wide: ſo that his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour was fruitfull not onely to one Citie, but alſo to places which were farre off: and that commeth to paſſe oftentimes, that when the truth of God is preached in one place, it ſoundeth where the voice of the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter cannot ſound, being ſpread abroad farre and wide: becauſe it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered from hand to hand, and one doth teach another. For one man were not ſufficient, vnleſſe euerie man were for himſelfe diligent to

               <p n="11">11 <hi>No ſmall myracles.</hi> Hee calleth myracles <hi>virtutes</hi> or powers, after the common cuſtome of the ſcripture, which were teſtimonies of the extraordinarie power of God. And he ſheweth that Paul his Apoſtleſhip was ſet forth with theſe enſignes, that his doctrin might haue the greter authoritie. For it is a common ſpeech, That wonders &amp; ſignes are ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the hande of men. So that the praiſe thereof is aſcribed to God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone as to the author: &amp; man is only the miniſter. And that he may the more amplifie the miracles, he ſaieth that handkircheffes and partlers were brought vnto the ſicke, which ſo ſoone as they touched they were healed. It is not vnknowne to what end Paul had ſuch power giuen him: to wit, that he might proue himſelfe to be a true Apoſtle of Chriſt, that he might make the goſpel to be beleeued, and might confirme his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie. And here it is expedient to call to mind, thoſe things which we had before touching the lawfull vſe of miracles. And whereas God did heale the ſicke with Paules handkirchiffes, it tended to that ende, that euen thoſe who had neuer ſeene the man, might notwithſtanding reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently embrace his doctrine though he himſelfe were abſent. For which cauſe the Papiſts are more blockiſh, who wreſt this place vnto their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques: as if Paul ſent his handkircheffes, that men might worſhip them and kiſſe them in honour of him: as in papiſtrie they worſhip Frances his ſhoes and mantill, Roſes girdle, Saint Margarets Combe, and ſuch like trifles. Yea rather he did chooſe moſt ſimple things, leaſt any ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition ſhould ariſe by reaſon of the price or pompe.

Vnder the reigne of Chriſt, wicked ambition cauſed ſtrife betweene the Chriſtians and the Iewes. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orciſts were made after the will of men: after that (as ſupeſtition doeth alwayes waxe worſe and worſe) the Pope woulde haue this common to all his Clarkes, who were to be promoted vnto an higher degree.

For they are in forced to confeſſe that they giue a vaine ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and ſuch as is without effect, for where is the power they haue to coniure diuels: and the very exorciſts themſelues do take vpon them to their owne reproch, an office which they neuer put in practice. But this falleth out iuſtly, that there is no end of erring, when men depart from the word of God. As touching theſe men we gather that they were wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering roges and ſuch as went from dore to dore, of which ſort wee ſee many at this day in poperie: for he ſaith that they went about.

                  <hi>We adiure you by Ieſus.</hi> It is a thing like to be true that theſe deceiuers flee vnto the name of Chriſt, that they might get newe power, whereof they had falſely boaſted before, or becauſe the power which they had did ceaſe, that they might darken the Goſpel. This inuocation had two faultes: for whereas they were enimies to Paul his doctrine, they abuſe the colour thereof without faith, as it were vnto magicall inchaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes: ſecondly they take to themſelues without the calling of God that which is not in mans hande. But the lawfull calling vppon the name of God and Chriſt, is that which is directed by faith, and doeth not paſſe the bounds of a mans calling. Wherefore wee are taught by this example, that we muſt attempt nothing vnleſſe wee haue the light of the word of God going before vs, leaſt we ſuffer like puniſhment for our ſacrilege. The Lorde himſelfe commandeth vs to pray. Whoſoeuer they be which haue not the gift of miracles giuen them, let them keepe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues within theſe bounds. For whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Apoſtles made the vncleane
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:7788:241"/> ſpirites come out of men, they had God for their authour, &amp; they knew that they did faithfully execute the miniſterie which he had enioyned them.</p>
               <p n="16">16 <hi>The man running vpon them.</hi> That is attributed to the man which the diuell did by him. For hee had not been able to doe ſuch an acte of himſelfe, as to put to flight ſeuen ſtrong young men being wounded and naked. And to ſet downe for a certaintie how the diuell doeth dwell in men, we cannot, ſaue only that there may be a contrarietie between the ſpirite of God, and the ſpirite of Satan. For as Paul teacheth that we be the temples of God, becauſe the ſpirite of God dwelleth in vs: ſo he ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth againe, that Satan worketh effectually in all vnbeleeuers. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding we muſt know that Luke ſpeaketh in this place of a particular kinde of dwelling: to wit, when Satan hath the bridle ſo much that hee doth poſſeſſe the whole man.</p>
               <p>Furthermore God meant to ſhew ſuch a token, that he might declare that his power is not included in the ſound of the voice, &amp; that it is not lawefull ſuperſtitiouſly to abuſe the name of his ſonne. And when hee ſuffereth Satan to deceiue vs, let vs know that we be more ſharply puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, then if he ſhould wound vs in the fleſh For the falſe ſhew &amp; colour of miracles, is an horrible inchantment to bewitch and befot the vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers, that they may be drowned in deeper darknes, becauſe they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed the light of God.</p>
               <p n="17">17 <hi>There came feare.</hi> The fruit of that vengeance which God brought vppon thoſe who did wickedly abuſe the name of Chriſt is this, in that they were all touched with reuerence, leaſt they ſhould contemn that doctrine, whoſe reuenger the Lord had ſhewed by an euident token &amp; teſtimonie he would be, and they were brought to reuerence Chriſte. For beſides that God doth inuite vs by all his iudgements to come thus farre, that they may terrifie vs from ſinning: in this example peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was the maieſty of Chriſt ſette foorth, and the authoritie of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel eſtabliſhed, wherefore there is more heauy and grieuous puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment prepared for deceiuers, who with their inchauntments profane the name of Chriſt wittingly, leaſt they promiſe to themſelues that they ſhall ſcape vnpuniſhed for ſuch groſſe ſacrilege.

Firſt the faithful confeſſed how miſerablie they had bin deceiued by Satan before they came to the faith, bringing into the ſight of men certain examples. But by the Popes Law it is required that men recken vp all their wordes and deeds and thoughts. We reede that thoſe men confeſſed this once. The Popes Law commandeth that it be repeated euery yeare at leaſt. Theſe men made confeſſion of their owne accorde: the Pope bindeth all men with neceſſitie. Luke ſaieth there came manie, not all: in the Pope his Law there is no exception. Theſe men humbled themſelues before the company of the faithful: the Pope giueth a farre other commandement: that the ſinner confeſſe his ſinnes whiſperingly in the eare of one prieſt.

But becauſe in the Church of God, where the vnitie of faith ought to reigne, there is nothing more odious or deteſtable, than for euerie man to chooſe at his pleaſure that which he will followe: I thinke that Luke did flie that name which was for good cauſes infamous among the godlie, and that after the Hebrew phraſe hee put way in ſteede of Ordinance. And as touching the ſumme of the matter, wee ſee howe wonderfully the Lorde did exerciſe his ſeruaunt. Hee did hope when hee did addreſſe himſelfe for his iourney, that the Church would be quiet after his departure, and loe there ariſeth an vprore at a ſodaine, where hee did leaſt feare. But in Demetrius it appeareth what a hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full plague couetouſneſſe is. For one man for his owne gaines ſake is not afraide to trouble a whole Citie with ſedition. And the craftes men, who were as firebrandes kindled by him, and doe ſpread abroad the fire euerie where, doe teach vs what an eaſie matter it is to cauſe filthie men and thoſe whoſe belly is their God, to commit all manner wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: eſpeciallie if they liue onely by gaines euill gotten, and the hope of gaine be taken from them. Moreouer in this hyſtorie wee ſee a liuely image of our time. Demetrius and his bande raiſe a tumult: becauſe if ſuperſtition whereby they were wont to get gaines be taken away, their craft will fall to grounde. Therefore they fight as if it were for their life: leaſt Demetrius goe without his fatte pray, and the reſt want their daily lyuing. What zeale doeth at this day pricke forwarde the Pope, the horned Byſhoppes, the Munkes, and all the rablement of the popiſh cleargie? Yea what furie doeth driue them, ſo ſore to reſiſt the Goſpell?

And as touching godly teachers, let them learn by this example, that they ſhall neuer want aduerſaries, vntill the whole world through deniall of it ſelf offer peace: which we know will neuer come to paſſe. Becauſe Paules do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine taketh away Demetrius and the reſt of the ſiluer ſmithes gaines, they leape out furiouſly to put out the ſame, will not they doe the ſame, whom the Goſpell ſhall contrary?

So that it muſt needs be, that how many luſts of the fleſhe there be in the world there are as many armed enemies to reſiſt Chriſt. It will in deede oftentimes fall out that God will bridle the wicked, leaſt they raiſe ſome tumult, or breake out into open rage. Yet whoſoeuer is not tamed, and brought downe to beare Chriſtes yoke, he ſhall alwaies hate his goſpel. So that faithfull &amp; godly teachers muſt perſuade themſelues that they ſhall alwayes haue to deale with great ſtore of enemies. Demetrius his couetouſnes is manifeſt. Neuertheleſſe we muſt alſo know this, that he was Satan his fan, who ſeking by all means to ouerthrow Pauls doctrin, found this fit inſtrument.

For if he had ſuffered no loſſe by Paul his doctrin he would haue ſit qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly at home: hee would neither haue taken thought for the worſhip of Diana, neither would he haue troubled others. What is the cauſe then he is ſo diligent and ſo earneſt in his buſineſſe, euen this, becauſe he was plagued at home? and becauſe he ſaw that hee and his copartners had no honeſt or probable cauſe to make any ſtirre, he goeth about to colour the matter with ſome other colour. Therefore to the end hee may couer the ſhame of his wicked fact, he cloketh it with the title of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; which is plauſible. So that the wicked howſoeuer they ſtriue frowardly againſt God; yet they gather heere and there honeſt excuſes impudently: but God doth not ſuffer himſelfe to be mocked: but doeth rather pull them out of their ſtarting holes. There needeth no other witneſſe to refute Dimetrius his hypocriſie becauſe he cutteth his owne throate with his owne words, when he bewrayeth the ſorow which he had conceiued, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the loſſe which he ſuſteined.

But if we haue a deſire to handle the cauſe of godlines purely and in earneſt, let vs forget our commodities, that the glory of God may haue the chief place. For the ſhew of profite doth ſo tie all our ſenſes with inticements, that though wee wander through all manner wickedneſſe, yet doe wee flatter our ſelues, ſo long as wee bee determined to prouide for our owne commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie.</p>

Like as if a thouſand houſes ſhould be ſet on fire at a ſodaine: ſo all the Citie was on an vprore in one moment: and when ſuch a tempeſt is once raiſed, it is not eaſily ſtayed. And foraſmuch as the ſeruants of Chriſt cannot auoid this miſchiefe, they muſt be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with inuincible conſtancie, that they may boldly ſuffer the tumults raiſed among the people, and that they may not bee troubled as with ſome new and ſtrange matter, when they ſee that the people is vnquiet. So Paul himſelf doth elſewhere triumph that he went valiantly through the midſt of ſedition.<note place="margin">2.

Therefore let vs know that we muſt ſaile as it were in a tempeſtuous ſea: yet that we muſt ſuffer this infamie, as if wee our ſelues were the procurers of trouble: neither may any thing leade vs away from the right courſe of our duetie. So that in ſailing wee ſhall be ſore troubled: yet will not the Lord ſuffer vs to ſuffer ſhipwrack. Furthermore we ſee that though ſedition bee confuſed, yet doeth the people alwayes take the worſe part: as the men of Epheſus do now catch Gaius and Ariſtarchus, and they driue backe Alexander with their fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious outcries. Whence commeth this, ſaue onely becauſe Satan doth reigne in their hearts, ſo that they rather fauour an euill cauſe?

For the town clarke, as politike me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vſe to do, counteth it ſufficient for him if he can by any meanes appeaſe the outragious multitude. Neuertheleſſe the cauſe it ſelfe is oppreſſed. He ſaw vndoubtedly Demetrius his malice, and howe hee had troubled the citie, abuſing the pretence of religion for his owne priuate gain: but he toucheth not that wound which he knew to be vnknowen to the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilful.

For thogh the towne clarke had not been by him commaunded to ſpeake thus: yet it ſhould haue been treacherous diſſimulation in a publike witneſſe and preacher of heauenly doctrine. The Scribe affirmeth that the Image which the Epheſians did worſhip came downe from heauen, and that Paul and his companions ſpake no blaſphemie againſt their goddeſſe. Could he haue holden his peace, but he muſt needs by his ſilence haue alowed his falſe excuſe? And this had been to ſhake hands with idolatry.

               </q>
               <p n="1">1 Luke declareth in this chapter how Paul looſing from Aſia, did againe croſſe the Seas to goe to Ieruſalem. And though whatſoeuer is written in this narration bee worthie of moſt diligent meditation and marking: yet doth it need no long expoſition. It appeareth that the church was preſerued in ſaftie by the wonderfull power of God amidſt thoſe troubleſome tumults. The church of Epheſus was as yet ſlender &amp; weake: the faithfull hauing had experience of a ſodaine motion once, might for iuſt cauſes feare, leaſt like ſtormes ſhould euer now and then ariſe. We need not doubt that Paul did with much ado depart from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: yet becauſe greater neceſſitie doth draw him vnto another place, hee is enforced to leaue his ſonnes who were lately begotten and had as yet ſcarce eſcaped ſhipwracke, in the midſt of the raging Sea. As for them though they be very loth to forgo Paul, yet leaſt they do iniurie to other churches, they do not keepe him back nor ſtay him. So that wee ſee that they were not wedded to themſelues, but that they were carefull for the kingdome of Chriſt, that they might prouide as well for their brethren as for themſelues. We muſt diligently note theſe examples, that one of vs may ſtudie to help another in this miſerable diſpearſing: but if it ſo fall out at any time that we be bereft of profitable helps, let vs not dout nor wauer, knowing that God doth hold the helme of our ſhip. And we muſt alſo note this that Paul doth not depart vntill he haue ſaluted the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, but doth rather ſtrengthen them at his departure. As Luke ſayeth ſtraightway of the Macedonians, that Paul exhorted them with many wordes: that is not ouerfieldes, as if it were ſufficient to put them onely in minde of their dutie: but as he commaundeth els where that others ſhoulde doe, hee vrged importunately and beate in throughly, things which were needfull to bee knowen: that they might neuer bee forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <note place="margin">2. Tim. 4.2.</note>3 <hi>Becauſe the Iewes laid wait for him.</hi> The Lord did exerciſe his ſeruant ſo diuerſly and continually, that hee ſet before vs in him an example
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:7788:246"/> of moſt excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t conſtancy. It is not ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for him to be wearied with the labour and trouble of a long and weriſome iourney, vnles he be alſo brought in danger of his life by thoſe which lay in waite for him. Let all the ſeruants of Chriſte ſet this mirrour before their eyes, that they may neuer faint through the weariſomnes of ſtraits. Notwithſtanding when Paul doth iourney another way that he may auoid their laying in wait, he ſheweth that we muſt haue regard of our life ſo farre foorth, that wee throw not our ſelues headlong into the midſt of da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers. And thoſe who accompanie him, giue no ſmal teſtimonie of their godlines: and we ſee how precious his life was to the faithful, when as a great many beeyng choſen out of diuers countries to be his companions, do for his ſake take a hard &amp; ſharp iourney, not without great charges. Luke ſaith that Paul tarried at Philippos ſo long as the daies of vnleauened bread did laſt, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had at that time better opportunitie offered to teach. And for as much as it was vnknown as yet that the law was diſanulled, it ſtoode him vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to beware leaſt by neglecting the feaſt day, he ſhuld be thought among the rude to be a contemner of God. Though for mine owne part I thinke that he ſought principally opportunity to teache, becauſe the Iewes were then more attentiue to learne.</p>
               <q>
                  <p n="7">
                     <hi>7</hi> And vpon one day of the Sabbothes when the diſciples were come together to breake bread, Paul diſputed with them, being about to take his iourney on the morrow: and he prolonged his ſpeech vntil midnight.</p>
                  <p n="8">
                     <hi>8</hi> And there were manie lightes in an vpper chamber, where they were gathered together.</p>

                     <hi>9</hi> And a certaine young man named Eutichus ſitting in a window, being fallen into a deepe ſleepe, as Paul diſputed long time, being more ouercome with ſleep, he fel down from the third loft downward, and was taken vp dead.</p>
                  <p n="10">
                     <hi>10</hi> And when Paul came downe, he fel vpon him, &amp; imbracing him ſaid, Be not yee troubled, for his ſoule is in him.</p>
                  <p n="11">
                     <hi>11</hi> And when he was gone vp, and had broken bread and had eaten, hauing had long conference vntill it was day, he departed.</p>
                  <p n="12">
                     <hi>12</hi> And they brought the boy aliue, and were not a litle comforted.</p>

                     <hi>13</hi> But when we had taken ſhip, we looſed to Aſſon, thence to receiue Paule, for ſo had he appointed, being about to goe by land.</p>
               </q>
               <p n="7">7 <hi>And in one day.</hi> Either doth he meane the firſt day of the week, which was next after the Sabboth, or els ſome certaine Sabboth. Which latter thing may ſeeme to me more probable: for this cauſe becauſe that daye was more fit for an aſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bly, according to cuſtome. But ſeeing it is no new matter for the Euangeliſts to put, one, inſteed of the firſt,<note place="margin">Mat. 26.1. Luk. 24.1. Ioh. 20.1.</note> according to the cuſtome of the Hebrew tongue, it ſhal very wel agree, that on the morrow after the Sabboth, they came together. Furthermore, it were too cold to expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d this of any day. For to what end is there mentioned of the Sabboth, ſaue only that he may note the opportunity &amp; choiſe of the time? Alſo it is a likely matter that Paul waited for the ſabboth, that the day before his departure, he might the more eaſily gather al the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:7788:247"/> into one place, And the zeale of them al is woorth the noting, in that it was no trouble to Paul to teach vntil midnight, though he were ready to take his iourney, neyther were the reſt weary of learning. For he had no other cauſe to continue his ſpeech ſo long ſaue onely the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and attentiuenes of his auditory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To breake bread.</hi> Though breaking of bread doth ſometimes ſignifie among the Hebrewes a domeſtical banquet: yet do I expound the ſame of the holie ſupper in this place, being moued with two reaſons. For ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we may eaſily gather by that which foloweth, that ther was no ſmal multitude gathered together there: it is vnlikely that there could any ſupper be prepared in a priuate houſe. Again Luke wil afterward declare that Paul tooke bread, not at ſupper time, but after midnight. Herevnto is added that, that he ſaith not that he tooke meate that he might eate. but that he might onlie taſt. Therefore I thinke thus, that they had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a ſolemn day for the celebrating of the holy ſupper of the Lord among themſelues, which might be commodious for them all. And to the end Paul might remedy after a ſort the ſilence of longer abſence, he continueth his ſpeech longer then he did commonly vſe to doe. That which I ſpake of the great number of men is gathered thence, becauſe there were many lights in the vpper chamber: which was not done for anie pompe or oſtentation, but only for neceſſities ſake. For when there is no need, it is ambition &amp; vanitie which maketh men beſtow coſt. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore it was meet that all the whole place ſhould ſhyne with lights leaſt that holy company might be ſuſpected of ſome wickednes or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſtie: adde alſo another coniecture, if the chamber had bin emptye, thoſe which were preſent would not haue ſuffered Eutichus to ſit vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a window. For it had bin filthy licenciouſnes in deſpiſing the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin, to depart aſide into a widow, ſeing ther was room inough elſwhere.</p>
               <p n="9">9 <hi>When he was faln into a deep ſleep.</hi> I ſee no cauſe why ſome interpreters ſhuld ſo ſore &amp; ſharply conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>n the drouſines of the yong ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that they ſhould ſay that he was puniſhed for his ſluggiſhnes by death. For what maruell is it, if ſeeing the nighte was ſo farre ſpent, hauing ſtriuen ſo long with ſleepe, he yeelded at length? And whereas againſt his will and otherwiſe then he hoped for, hee was taken and ouercome with deepe ſleepe, we may gueſſe by this that he did not ſettle himſelfe to ſleepe. To ſeeke out a fit place wherein to ſleep, had bin a ſigne of ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſhnes, but to be ouercome with ſleep, ſitting at a window, what other thing is it, but without fault to yeelde to nature? As if a man ſhoulde faint through hunger or too much weariſomnes. Thoſe who being drow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned in earthly cares come vnto the word lothſomly: thoſe who being ful of meate and wine, are thereby brought on ſleepe: thoſe who are vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant ynough in other matters, but heare the woord as though they did not paſſe for it, ſhalbe iuſtly condemned for drouſines: but Luke doth in plaine words acquit Eutichus, when he ſaith that he fel downe, being ouercome with deepe ſleepe after midnight.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, the Lord mea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t not only by the ſleep, but alſo by the death of this yong man to awake &amp; ſtir vp the faith of his, that they might more
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:7788:247"/> ioyfully receiue Paul his doctrine &amp; might keep it deeply rooted in their minds. It was in deed at the firſt no ſmall temptation, but ſuch as might haue ſhaken euen a moſt conſtant man full ſore, for who woulde haue thought that Chriſt had bin chiefe gouernor in that company, wherein a miſerable ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> through a fal became dead? Who would not rather haue thought this to be a ſigne of Gods curſe? But the Lord by applying a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie, doth forthwith rid the minds of his of all perturbation.</p>
               <p n="10">10 <hi>He lay downe vpon him.</hi> We know that the Apoſtles in working mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles did ſometimes vſe certaine externall rites, whereby they might giue the glorie to God the authour. And nowe whereas Paul doeth ſtretch himſelfe vppon the young man, I thinke it was done to no other end, ſaue onely that he might more ſtirre vp himſelfe vnto prayer. It is all one as if he ſhould mixe himſelfe with the dead man. And peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture this was done for the imitation of Elizeus, of whom the ſacred hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorie doth report the ſame thing. Yet the vehemencie of his affection did more moue him, that the emulation of the Prophet. For that ſtret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of himſelfe vpon him, doeth more prouoke him to craue his life with all his heart, at the handes of the Lorde. So when he embraceth the bodie of the dead man, by this geſture he declared that hee offered it to God to be quickned, and out of the text wee may gather that hee did not depart from imbracing it, vntill he knew that the life was reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red againe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bee yee not troubled.</hi> We muſt note that Paul tooke great care prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally for this cauſe, leaſt that ſorowfull euent ſhould ſhake the faith of the godlie, and ſhould trouble their mindes. Neuertheleſſe the Lorde did as it were ſeale vp &amp; eſtabliſhe that laſt Sermon which Paul made at Troas, when he ſayeth, that his ſoule is in him, hee doeth not denie that he was dead, becauſe by this meanes he ſhould extinguiſh the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the myracle: but the meaning of theſe wordes is, that his life was reſtored through the grace of God. I doe not reſtraine that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, to wit, that they wer greatly comforted vnto the ioy which they had by reaſon of the young man which was reſtored to life: but I do alſo comprehend the confirmation of faith, ſeeing God gaue them ſuch an excellent teſtimony of his loue,</p>
               <p n="13">13 <hi>When wee had taken ſhippe.</hi> It is vncertain why Paul did chooſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to goe by lande: whether it were becauſe ſayling might be to him troubleſome, or that as he did paſſe by hee might viſite the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. I think that hee did then eſchew the ſeas for his healthes ſake. And his curteſie is greately to bee commended, in that he ſpared hys companions. For to what ende did hee ſuffer them to departe, ſaue onelie that hee might eaſe them of the trouble? So that we ſee that they did ſtriue among them ſelues in curteſie and good turnes. They were ready and willing to doe their duetie: but Paul was ſo farre from requiring thinges ſtreitly at their handes, that of his owne accord and curteouſly he did remit thoſe dueties which they were readie to doe: yea ſetting aſide his own co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modity, he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded them to do that which was for their comfort.

               <p n="16">16 <hi>For Paul purpoſed.</hi> It is not to be douted but that he had great &amp; weightie cauſes to make haſt: not that he made ſo great account of the day, but becauſe ſtrangers did the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vſe to come together to Ieruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of al quarters. Foraſmuch as he did hope that he might doe ſom good in ſuch a great aſſembly, he would not foreſlow the opportunitie. Therfore let vs know that the worſhip of the law was not the cauſe that he made ſo great haſt: but he ſet before his eyes the edifying of the church: part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that he might ſhew to the faithfull that the kingdome of Chriſt was enlarged, partly that if there were any as yet ſtrangers from Chriſt, hee might gaine them: partly that he might ſtoppe the mouthes of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked. Notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding we muſt note, that he did in the meane ſeaſon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for other churches. For in ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding for the elders of Epheſus to Mile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, he ſheweth that he did not neglect Aſia. And whereas they come together when they be called, it is not only a token of concord, but alſo of modeſtie. For they were manie: yet doeth it not irke them to obeye one Apoſtle of Chriſte, whome they knewe to bee indued with ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular giftes. Moreouer it appereth more plainely by the text, that thoſe are called elders, not which were gray headed, but ſuch as were rulers of the Church. And it is an vſual thing almoſt in all tongues, that thoſe be called elders &amp; fathers, who are appointed to gouern others, though their age be not alwaies according.</p>
               <p n="18">18 <hi>Yee knowe.</hi> Paul in this ſermon ſtandeth principally vpon this, that he may exhort thoſe paſtours of Epheſus, by his owne example, to doe their duetie faithfully. For that is the true kinde of cenſure, and by this
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:7788:248"/> meanes is authority purchaſed to doctrine, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the teacher preſcribeth nothing, which he himſelfe hath not done in deed before. And it was no vnſeemly thing for Paul to ſpeake of his vertues. There is nothing leſſe tollerable in the ſeruauntes of Chriſt then ambyrion and vanity: but for as much as all men know full well what modeſtie and humility was in the holie man, hee needed not to feare leaſt he ſhoulde incurre the ſuſpition of vayne boaſting: eſpecially ſeeing that beyng infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by neceſſitie, he did declare his faithfulneſſe and diligence that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther might take example thereby. He doth in deede greatly extoll his labours, patience, fortitude, and other vertues, but to what ende? Surely not that he may purchaſe commendation at the hands of his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditory, but that this holy exhortation may pearce more deeply, and may ſticke faſt in their myndes. He did alſo ſhoote at another marke, that his integritie and vprightneſſe in dealing, might ſerue afterward to commende his doctrine. And he citeth eie witneſſes, leaſt he ſeem to ſpeake of things vnknowen. I call thoſe witneſſes who did not only know all things: but had alſo a iudgement which was pure, and corrupt with no affections.</p>
               <p n="19">19 <hi>Seruing the Lord.</hi> He reckoneth vp firſt not onely in what ſtraites he was, but moſt of all his humilitie coupled with conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt of the world, and rebukes, and other afflictions: as if he ſhould ſay, that he was not honourably receiued or with commendation: but he was conuerſaunt among them vnder the contemptible form of the croſſe. And this is no ſmal trial, when we faint not, though we ſee our ſelues troden vnder foot by the intollerable pride of the world.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding we muſt note euery thing more diſtinctly. To ſerue the Lord is taken in this place, not for to woorſhip God in holines and righteouſnes, which is common to all the godlie. But it doth ſignifie to execute a publike function. Therefore Paul doeth not ſpeake of ſome one priuate man: but as one made a miniſter of the Churche. And ſo he doth teſtifie that hee fulfilled the Apoſtleſhip to him committed with humilitie and modeſtie: both becauſe knowing his owne infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, he did miſtruſt himſelfe: and alſo becauſe conſidering the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie of his calling, he counted him ſelfe verye vnmeete: and laſtly, becauſe he did willingly ſubmit him ſelfe to beare the reproch of the Croſſe. For this humilitie is ſet both againſt vaine confidence, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo hawtineſſe. Secondly, he toucheth his teares, which ſtrifes, diuers aſſaultes of Satan, the rage of wicked men, the inward diſeaſes of the Churche, and offences had made him ſhedde: at length he addeth that hee ledde a fearefull life amiddeſt the layinges in wayte of the Iewes: and he confeſſeth that he was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>empted therewith, as hee was not hardened though he did not faint. For he is not aſhamed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe his infirmitie. His drift is, that thoſe to whom he ſpeaketh may not faint through like tribulations, and that beyng voide of all ambition, they maye doe their duetie carefully and reuerently. And that they may not onelie with a pacient minde ſuffer them ſelues to bee deſpy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of men, but that they may be caſt downe in them ſelues: becauſe
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:7788:249"/> that man can neuer be rightly framed to obey Chriſt, whoſe lookes are loftie, and whoſe heart is proude. And (as men cannot long beare a ſhewe of vertue) to the ende it may appeare manifeſty, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haued hym ſelfe ſincerely and from his hearte, he maketh mention of his conſtancie which laſted three yeeres, wherein he had ſtil kept one courſe. Yee knowe (ſayeth hee) howe I haue behaued my ſelfe ſince the firſt daye vntill this time. To conclude, this is the true try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of the ſeruauntes of Chriſte, not to bee chaunged as the tymes change: but to continue like to themſelues, &amp; alwaies to keep a ſtreight courſe.</p>
               <p n="20">20 <hi>I haue kepte backe nothing.</hi> He commendeth his faithfulneſſe and diligence in teaching in three reſpectes, that hee inſtructed his ſchollers throughly and perfectly, ſo that he omitted nothing whiche might make for their ſaluation: that beyng not content with gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall preaching, he did alſo indeuour to doe euery man good. Thirdly, he reciteth a briefe ſumme of all his whole doctrine, that hee exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them vnto faith in Chriſt and repentaunce. Now for as much as he depaynteth out vnto vs a patterne of a faithfull &amp; good Teacher: whoſoeuer they be who are deſirous to prooue their induſtrie to the Lorde, they muſt ſet before their eyes the edifying of the Church: as he commaundeth Timotheus in another place, to conſider what thinges be profitable,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 4.7.8.</note> that he may bee inſtaunt in deliuering thoſe thinges. And ſurely the Scripture (according to whoſe rule all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of teaching muſt be examined, yea which is the onelie method of teaching aright) doth not containe profound ſpeculations, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light men when they haue nothing els to doe; but as the ſame Paul doth teſtifie, it is all profitable to make the man of God perfect. But Paul preſcribeth ſuch a deſire to edifie, that the Paſtour muſt omit nothing, ſo much as in him lieth, which is profitable to be knowen. For they be bad maiſters who doe ſo keepe their ſchollers in the firſte principles,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 3.17.</note> that they doe neuer come vnto the knowledge of the trueth. And ſurely the Lorde doth not teach vs in his woorde one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to halfes (as they ſay) but he deliuereth perfect wiſedome and ſuch as is in all pointes abſolute: whereby it appeareth howe impudently thoſe menne boaſt them ſelues to be miniſters of the worde, who doe not onely cloake and foſter the ignoraunce of the people wyth their ſilence, but doe alſo winke at groſſe errours and wicked ſuperſtitions: as at this daye in Papiſtrie, many ſend out ſome ſparkles of ſound do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, but they dare not driue away the darkneſſe of ignoraunce, and where as the wicked feare of the fleſh doth hinder them, they pretende that the people is not capable of ſound doctrine.</p>
               <p>Indeed I confeſſe that all thinges cannot be taught at one time, and that we muſt imitate Paul his wiſedom, who did apply himſelfe vnto the capacitie of the ignoraunt. But what moderation is this when they ſuffer the blinde to fal into the ditch, when they leaue myſerable ſoules vnder the tyranny of Antichriſt: and whereas they ſee Idolatrie
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:7788:249"/> rage, the worſhip of God corrupt, his Lawe broken, and finally all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> thinges prophaned, they doe either with ſilence paſſe ouer ſuch filthie confuſion, or elſe they ſhew it vnder hand ſparingly and obſcurelie like men that be afraid? Therefore we muſt note Paul his word, when as he ſaith that he kept backe nothing, but did ſhew whatſoeuer things were profitable for the people: for by this wee gather that the pure and free profeſſion of ſounde doctrine is required at the hands of the ſeruants of Chriſt, wherein there muſt be no boughts nor crooks, and that nothing is more vnſeemely in them than oblique inſinuations, and ſuch as are inwrapped in crafty diſſimulation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Publikelie and through out euery houſe.</hi> This is the ſeconde point, that hee did not onely teach all men in the congregation, but alſo euery one priuatly, as euerie mans neceſſitie did require. For Chriſt hath not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Paſtours vppon this condition, that they may onely teach the Church in generall in the open pulpit: but that they may take charge of euery particular ſheepe, that they may bring backe to the ſheepefold thoſe which wander and goe aſtray, that they may ſtrengthen thoſe which are diſcouraged and weake, that they may cure the ſick,<note place="margin">Eze. 34.4.</note> that they may lift vppe and ſet on foote the feeble: for common doctrine will of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes waxe colde, vnleſſe it bee holpen with priuate admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>Wherefore the negligence of thoſe men is inexcuſeable who hauing made one Sermon, as if they had done their task liue all the reſt of their time idlely: as if their voice were ſhut vp within the church walles, ſeing that ſo ſoone as they be departed thence they be dumbe. Alſo diſciples and ſcholers are taught, that if they will be numbred in Chriſtes flocke, they muſt giue place to their paſtours, ſo often as they come vnto them: and that they muſt not refuſe priuate admonitions. For they bee rather Beares then ſheep, who do not vouchſafe to heare the voice of their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtour vnleſſe he bee in the pulpit: and cannot abide to bee admoniſhed and reproued at home, yea, doe furiouſly refuſe that neceſſarie du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</p>
               <p n="21">21 <hi>Teſtifying both to Iewes.</hi> Deſcending nowe vnto the thyrde poynt, he ſetteth downe the ſumme of this doctrine in a fewe woords, to witte, that he exhorted all menne vnto faith and repentaunce, as it was ſayde before, that, The Goſpell conſiſteth vpon theſe two points onely. Whence wee doe alſo gather, wherein the true edifying of the Church, doth properly conſiſt, the care and burthen whereof doeth lie vppon the Paſtours ſhoulders, and wherevnto wee muſt applie all our ſtudie, if wee be deſirous to profite profitably in Gods ſchoole. We haue already ſaide, that the woorde of God is profaned, when the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the ſame doe occupie themſelues in friuolous queſtions. But to the end we may not reade the ſame wanderingly, we muſt note &amp; aime at this double mark which the Apoſtle ſetteth before vs. For whoſoeuer he be that turneth vnto anie other thing, in taking greate paynes, hee ſhall doe nothing elſe but walke in a circuite. By the woorde Teſtifie he expreſſeth greater vehememencie, as if he ſhoulde haue ſayde that
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:7788:250"/> by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>ifying he did commend, that the excuſe of ignorance might not remaine. For he alludeth vnto the cuſtome vſed in Courts: where teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying is vſed to take away all doubt. As men are not onely to be taught, but alſo to be conſtrained, to embrace ſaluation in Chriſt, and to addict themſelues to God to leade a new life. And though he affirme that hee was wanting to none, yet doth he place the Iewes in the firſt place: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as the Lord had preferred them in the degree of honor before the Gentiles, ſo it was meete that Chriſt and his grace ſhoulde bee offered them vntill they ſhould quite fall away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repentance toward God.</hi> We muſt firſt note the diſtinction of faith and Repentance, which ſome doe falſely and vnskilfully confounde, ſaying that repentance is a part of faith. I grant in deede that they cannot bee ſeperate: becauſe God doth illuminate no man with the Spirit of faith, whom he doth not alſo regenerate vnto newneſſe of life. Yet they muſt needs be diſtinguiſhed as Paul doth in this place. For Repentance is a turning vnto God, when wee frame our ſelues and all our life to obey him: but faith is a receiuing of the grace offered vs in Chriſt. For all reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion tendeth to this end that imbracing holineſſe and righteouſnes, we ſerue the Lord purely, alſo that wee ſeeke no part of our ſaluation any where els ſaue only at his hands: and that we ſeek ſaluation in Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loue. Therefore the doctrine of repentance containeth a rule of good life, it requireth the deniall of our ſelues, the mortifying of our fleſh, and meditating vpon the heauenly life. But becauſe we be all naturally cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, ſtrangers from righteouſneſſe, and turned away from God himſelf: againe, becauſe we flie from God, becauſe we know that he is diſpleaſed with vs: the meanes as well to obtaine free reconciliation, as newneſſe of life muſt be ſet before vs. Therefore vnleſſe fath be added, it is in vain to ſpeake of repentance: yea thoſe teachers of repentance, who neglec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting faith, ſtand only vpon the framing of life, &amp; precepts of good works, differ nothing or very little from profane Philoſophers. They teach how men muſt liue, but foraſmuch as they leaue men in their nature, there can no bettering be hoped for thence, vntill they inuite thoſe who are loſt vnto hope of ſaluation, vntill they quicken the dead, promiſing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenes of ſinnes, vntill they ſhewe that God doth by his free adoption take thoſe for his children, who were before bonſlaues of Satan, vntill they teach that the ſpirit of regeneration muſt be begged at the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds of the heauenly father, that we muſt draw godlines, righteouſnes, &amp; good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes from him who is the fountaine of all good things. And herevppon followeth calling vpon God, which is the chiefeſt thing in the woorſhip of God. We ſee now how that repentance and faith are ſo linked toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that they cannot be ſeparate. For it is faith which reconcileth God to vs, not only that he may be fauorable vnto vs, by acquitting vs of the guiltines of death, by not imputing to vs our ſinnes: but alſo that by pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the filthineſſe of our fleſhe by his ſpirite, hee may faſhion vs again after his owne image. He doth not therfore name repentance in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer place, as if it did wholly goe before faith, for as much as a part ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of proceedeth from faith, and is and effect thereof: but becauſe the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:7788:250"/> of repentaunce is a preparation vnto faith. I call the d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 chunk">

                  <hi>Faith toward Chriſt.</hi> It is not without cauſe that the ſcripture doeth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery where make Chriſt the marke whereat our faith muſt ayme, and as they ſay commonly, ſet him before vs as the obiect. For the maieſty of God is of it ſelf higher then that men can climb thervnto. Therfore vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe Chriſt come between, al our ſenſes do vaniſh away in ſeeking God. Againe, in as much as he is the iudge of the world, it muſt needes bee that the beholding of him without Chriſt, ſhal make vs afraid. But God doth not only repreſent himſelf vnto vs in Chriſt his image: but alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh vs with his fatherly fauour, &amp; by al meanes reſtore vs to life. For there is no part of our ſaluation, which may not bee found in Chriſt. By the ſacrifice of his death he hath purged our ſins: hee hath ſuffered the puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that he might acquit vs: he hath made vs clean by his blood: by his obedience he hath appeaſed his fathers wrath: by his reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he hath purchaſed righteouſnes for vs. No maruel therefore if we ſayd, that faith muſt be fixed in the beholding of Chriſt.</p>

For to the end he may excuſe himſelf of raſhnes, he ſaith that the ſpirite is the authour &amp; guide of his iourney. But woulde to God thoſe brainſick men, who boaſt that the ſpirit doth indite to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe things which proceed from their own fantaſie, did know the ſpirit as familiarly as did Paul, who doth notwithſtanding not ſay that al his motions and inſtigations are of the ſpirit, but declareth that that fel out in one thing as a ſinguler thing. For men do oftentimes fooliſhly &amp; vnaduiſedly take in hande thoſe things, which they put in practiſe afterwarde ſtoutly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they be aſhamed of lightnes and vnſtabilitie. And he doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meane that he tooke in hand his iourney for a good cauſe which the ſpirit of god ſheweth him: but that it is altogether neceſſary for him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is wickednes to reſiſt. Furthermore, let vs learne by the example of the holy man, not to kick againſt the ſpirit of the Lord, but obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly to giue ouer our ſelues by him to be gouerned, that he may rule vs at his pleaſure after we be as it were bound to him. For if the reprobate, who are the bo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſlaues of Sata<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be carried not only willingly, but alſo greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly through his motion: how much more ought this voluntary bondage, or ſeruice to be in the children of God?</p>

And this ſpeech hath greater dignity to ſet forth the prophecies, then if the men the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, which ſpake, were called &amp; cited to be witneſſes. For by this meanes the word of God hath his authoritie, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we confeſſe that the ſpirit of God is the author therof: though the miniſters be me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

For it is a filthy thing for vs to be ſo holden with a blind deſire to liue, that we looſe the cauſes of life for life it ſelf: &amp; this do the words of Paul expreſſe. For he doeth not ſimplie ſet light by his life: but he doth forget the reſpect thereof, that he may finiſh his courſe: that he may fulfil the miniſtery which he hath receiued of Chriſt: as if he ſhould ſay that he is not deſirous to liue, ſaue onely that he may ſatiſfie the calling of God: and that therefore it ſhall bee no griefe to him to looſe his life, ſo that hee may come by death vnto the goale of the function preſcribed to him by God. And we muſt note that which he ſaith <hi>with ioy,</hi> for his meaning is that this is taken from the faithful by no ſorrow or griefe, but that they both liue and die to the Lord. For the ioy of a good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience is more deeply &amp; ſurely laid vp, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that it can be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away by any externall troble, or any ſorrow of the fleſh: it triumpheth more ioyfully, than that it can be oppreſſed. Alſo we muſt note the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of his courſe: to wit, that it is the miniſtery receiued of the Lord. Paul doth in deed ſpeak of himſelf: yet by his own example he teacheth that all thoſe goe aſtray who haue not God to be the gouernour of their courſe. Whereupon it followeth that his calling is vnto euery one of vs a rule of good life. Neither can we be otherwiſe perſwaded that the Lorde alloweth that which we doe, vnleſſe our life be framed &amp; ordered accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his wil, which certainty is required eſpecially in the miniſters of the worde, that they take nothing in hand vnleſſe they haue Chriſt for their authour. Neither is it to be doubted but that Paul in giuing his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtleſhip this mark (as he vſeth to do very often) doth confirm the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit thereof. He calleth it the Goſpel of the grace of God, of the effect or end, notwithſtanding this is a title of rare commendation, that by the goſpel ſaluation &amp; the grace of god are brought vnto vs. For it is very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient for vs to know that god is fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ther to be merciful &amp; fauorable.</p>

For we know what great force the words and ſpeeches of men haue, which are vttered at their departure or death. Alſo he wold haue them beware by this forwarning, that they do not depend vpon his preſence, &amp; ſo their faith ſhuld faint through weariſomnes.

So ſhal it come to paſſe that the inuentions of men ſhal haue none entrance into the Church of God.

I ſaid that wiſedome muſt be vſed: becauſe we muſt alwaies haue reſpect vnto profit, ſo there be no ſubtiltie vſed, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in many take too great delight, when as they turne and wreſt the word of God vnto their methods, and forge to vs a certaine kinde of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie mixed of the Goſpel &amp; their own inuentions: Namely becauſe this mixture is more delectable. Thence haue we freewill, thence the deſerts of works, thence the deniall of the prouidence and free election of God. And that which we ſaid eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> now is to be noted, that the counſel of god, whereof Paul maketh mention, is included in his word, &amp; that it is to be ſought no where elſe. For many things are kept from vs in this life, the perfect &amp; full manifeſtation whereof is deferred vntill that day, wherein we ſhall ſee God as he is with new eyes face to face. Therefore thoſe do ſet forth the will of God, who interpreat the ſcriptures faithfully, &amp; out of them inſtruct the people in the faith, in the feare of God, and in all exerciſes of Godlines. And as we ſaid of late, that thoſe are condemned by this ſentence,<note place="margin">1.

The firſt reaſon is, becauſe they be bound to the flocke ouer which they be ſet. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, becauſe they were called vnto this function not by mortall man, but by the holie Ghoſt. The third, becauſe it is no ſmall honor to gouern the Church of God. The fourth, becauſe the Lord did declare by an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident teſtimony, what account he doth make of the church, ſeing that he hath redeemed it with his blood. As touching the firſt, hee doth not onelie commaund them to take heed to the flocke, but firſt to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues. For that man will neuer be carefull for the ſaluation of other men, who will neglect his owne. And in vaine ſhall that man pricke forward other to liue godlily, who will himſelfe ſhewe no deſire of godlineſſe. Yea that man will not take paines with his flocke, who forgetteth himſelfe, ſeing he is a part of the flock. Therfore to the end, they may be careful for the flocke to them committed, Paul co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeth &amp; warneth, that euery one of them keep himſelf in the feare of God. For by this meanes it ſhoulde come to paſſe that euery one ſhould be as faithful towards his flocke as he ought. For we ſaid that Paul reaſoneth from their calling, that they be bound to take paines in the church of God, whereof they haue the gouernment. As if he ſhould ſay, that they may not do whatſoeuer they like beſt, neither are they free, after they be made paſtours: but they be bound publikely to al the flocke.</p>

But by a fitte ſimilitude it is tranſlated vnto euerie kinde of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment. And wee haue ſaide that this is the thirde argument drawen from the excellencie of the function: as the ſame Paul telleth Timothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us elſwhere, that he take heed &amp; ſee how he ought to behaue him ſelfe in the houſe of God, which is the church of the liuing God, the pillar &amp; ground of trueth. As if he ſhould ſay, that there is no time to be idle in ſuch a weightie calling, &amp; that thoſe are leſſe excuſable, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God hath made ſtewards of his family, the higher that degree of honor is, vnleſſe they be correſpondent to ſo great dignity, that is, vnles they do their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty diligently Now if Biſhops or ouerſeers be made by the holy ghoſt, to the end they may feede the church, the Hierarchy of papiſtry is ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, wherin biſhops being proud of their painted ſheath &amp; vain title, do not ſo much as once meddle with the function of teaching, no not for faſhions ſake.</p>

                  <hi>Which he hath purchaſed.</hi> The 4. reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wherby Paul doth carefully pricke forward the paſtors to do their duty dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly, bicauſe the lord hath giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no ſmal pledge of his loue toward the church, in ſhedding his own blood for it. Wherby it appeareth how precious it is to him: &amp; ſurely ther is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which ought more veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly to vrge paſtors to do their duty ioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, then if they conſider, that the price of the blood of Chriſt is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

And this is a moſt cruel offence, if through our ſluggiſhnes the death of Chriſt do not only become vile or baſe, but the fruit therof be alſo aboliſhed &amp; periſh: and it is ſaid that god hath purchaſed the church, to the end we may know that he wold haue it remaine wholly to himſelf, becauſe it is meet &amp; right that he poſſeſſe thoſe who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he hath redeemed.</p>

               <p>Notwithſtanding we muſt alſo remember, that all mankind are the bondſlaues of Satan, vntil Chriſt ſet vs free from his tyranny, gathering vs into the inheritance of his father. But becauſe the ſpeech which Paul vſeth ſeemeth to be ſomewhat hard, we muſt ſee in what ſenſe he ſaieth that God purchaſed the Church with his bloode. For nothing is more abſurd, than to faigne or imagine God to be mortall or to haue a bodie. But in this ſpeech he commendeth the vnitie of perſon in Chriſt: for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there be diſtinct natures in Chriſt, the ſcripture doth ſometimes recite that apart by it ſelf which is proper to either. But when it ſetteth god before vs made manifeſt in the fleſh, it doth not ſeperate the human nature from the godhead. Notwithſtanding becauſe againe two natures are ſo vnited in Chriſt, that they make one perſon, that is vnproperlie tranſlated ſomtimes vnto the one, which doth truly and in deed belong to the other, as in this place Paul doth attribute blood to God: becauſe the man Ieſus Chriſt who ſhed his blood for vs, was alſo God. This man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſpeaking is called of the olde writers <hi>communicatio idiomatum,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the property of the one nature is applied to the other. And I ſaid that by this means is manifeſtly expreſſed one perſon of Chriſt: leaſt we imagine him to be double, which Neſtorius did in times paſt attempt, and yet for all this we muſt not imagine a confuſion of the two natures, which Eutiches went about to bring in: or which the Spaniſh dogge Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetus hath at this time inuented, who maketh the godhead of Chriſt nothing elſe but a forme or image of the humain nature, which he drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to haue alwayes ſhined in God.</p>
               <p n="29">29 <hi>For I know.</hi> Paul doth now exhort the Epheſians to watch diligenly, by the neceſſity which is a moſt ſharp pricke. For he ſaith that grieuous wolues are readie to inuade the ſheepefold. This is a thing alwayes inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the Church to be hated of wolues. Wherefore there is no time to ſleepe. But the moe and the more hurtfull thoſe be who breake in, the more watchful muſt the Paſtors be. For God doth ſomtimes releaſe ſom part of trouble, that the flocke may be fed quietly and peaceably: and as when the weather is faire &amp; cleare the ſheepe are fed more ſafely in the fields, and there is more danger when the aire is cloudy &amp; darke: ſo the Church of God hath ſomtimes ſome faire weather granted to it, after that commeth a troubleſome time, which is more fit for the ſubtiltie of the wolues. Therefore Paul doth meane, that it ſtandeth them vpon to be more watchful than they haue bin hitherto, becauſe greater dangers hang ouer their heads. But the queſtion is how Paul knew this. Firſt we need not doubt of this, but that his preſence was of great force to driue away wolues, &amp; no maruel if the power of the ſpirit which ſhineth in the miniſters of Chriſt do bridle the wicked ſo, that they dare not vtter their poiſon: yea if that heauenly light do driue away much darknes of Satan. Therfore ſeing that Paul did know that the malice of ſatan was kept vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for a time by his induſtry, he doth eaſily foretel what wil happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> after his departure, thogh it be likely he was certified by the lord through the ſpirit of prophecy, that others might be admoniſhed by him, as we ſee it came to paſſe. Howſoeuer it be, ſo often as faithful Paſtours go away, let
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:7788:254"/> vs learne that we muſt beware of wolues; whom they can hardly driue from the ſheepcoates though they watch moſt narrowly.</p>
               <p n="30">30 <hi>Of your owne ſelues ſhall ariſe.</hi> This amplifieth the grieuouſneſſe of the euill, becauſe there bee ſome wolues within, and ſo hiding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vnder the title of Paſtours, do wait for ſome opportunitie where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they may doe hurt. Alſo he declareth what daunger theſe wolues do threaten, to wit, the ſcattering abroad of the flocke: when the Church is drawne away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the vnitie of faith, and is diuided into ſects. Neither are all thoſe wolues who doe not their duetie as they ought: but there be oftentimes hyrelings a kinde of men not ſo hurtfull as the other. But the corruption of doctrine is a moſt deadly plague to the ſheepe. Now in the third place the fountaine and beginning of this euill is noted: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they wil draw diſciples after them. Therefore ambition is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all hereſies. For the ſynceritie of the word of God doth then flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, when the Paſtors ioine hand in hand to bring diſciples vnto Chriſt: becauſe this alone is the ſound ſtate of the Church, that he be heard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone: wherefore both the doctrine of ſaluation muſt needs be peruerted, and alſo the ſafetie of the flocke muſt needs goe to nought, where men bee deſirous of maſterſhip. And as this place teacheth that almoſt all corruptions of doctrine flow from the pride of men: ſo we learne againe out of the ſame that it cannot otherwiſe be, but that ambitious men will turne away from right puritie, and corrupt the word of God. For ſeing that the pure and ſincere handling of the ſcripture tendeth to this end, that Chriſt alone may haue the preheminence: and that men can cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge nothing to themſelues, but they ſhal take ſo much from the glory of Chriſt: it followeth that thoſe are corrupters of ſound doctrine, who are addicted to themſelues and ſtudy to aduance their own glory, which doth onely darken Chriſt.<note place="margin">Iohn. 7.18.</note> Which thing the Lord himſelf doth confirme in the ſeuenth of Iohn. Furtheremore by the word Ariſe which he vſeth, he ſignifieth that thoſe wolues do nouriſh ſecreat deſtruction, vntil they may haue ſome opportunitie offered to breake out. And this place doth very wel preuent an horrible ſtumbling blocke and offence which Satan hath alwayes caſt in to trouble weake conſciences. If externall and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed enimies doe reſiſt the Goſpel, this doeth not ſo much hurt to the Church, as if inwarde enimies iſſue out of the boſome of the Church which at a ſodaine blow to the field, or which vnfaithfully prouoke the people to fall away: and yet God hath from the beginning exerciſed his Church with this temptation, and now doth exerciſe it. Wherefore let our faith be fortified with this defenſe, that it faile not, if at any time it ſo fal out that Paſtours begin to rage like wolues. He ſaieth they ſhalbe grieuous wolues that he may the more terrifie them: ſecondly they ſhal be authours of wicked opinions, and that to the end they may draw diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples after them: becauſe it cannot almoſt otherwiſe be but that ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will corrupt the puritie of the Goſpel. By this it appeareth alſo how friuolous and vaine the bragge of the Papiſts is, touching their conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual ſucceſſion. For ſeing we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eaſily ſhew that theſe horned beaſts are nothing leſſe than that which they will be thought to be: being alwayes
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:7788:254"/> conuict, they flie vnto this fortreſſe, that they ſucceed the Apoſtles by a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinual courſe. As if theſe did not alſo ſucceed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Paul willeth to take heed. Therfore ſeeing that god, either to proue the conſtancie of his, or in his iuſt iudgement doth oftentimes ſuffer wolues to rage vnder the perſon of Paſtours: the authoritie doth not conſiſt in the name and place alone: neither is ſucceſſion any thing worth, vnleſſe faith and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegritie be ioyned therewithall. But and if the Papiſts obiect, that they cannot be called wolues, one worde of Paul ſhall bee as a touchſtone to proue whether this be ſo or no: that they may (ſayeth he) drawe Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples after them. And to what ende tendeth all popiſh religion ſaue on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie that mens luſt and pleaſure may reigne in ſteed of Gods worde? But Chriſte hath no Diſciples, where hee is not counted the onely ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</p>
               <p n="31">31 <hi>For which cauſe watch.</hi> Paul doeth againe exhort them vnto dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence by his owne example: though hee doth ioyne therewithall feare of daunger: as if he ſhould ſay, that they haue need of great attention to beware: and that it is an vnſeemely thing that they ſhould bee wearied, who haue ſeene his ſingular patience by the ſpace of three yeeres. Alſo he ſpeaketh of his teares which did adde no ſmal efficacie to his exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. Wheras he ſaith that he admoniſhed euery one, it may be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as wel vnto the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon people as vnto the elders. For bicauſe he was determined to ſpeak ſuch things as ſhuld be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon to the whol church, he ſpeaketh as if the whole body were preſent. Neuertheleſſe if any had rather raſtrain it vnto the order of the paſtours: the meaning ſhall bee this, that their ſtudies muſt be kindled not onely with this ſpeech which he now maketh, but that it is meet that they remember thoſe often ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations which he did continually beat in by the ſpace of three yeres, and that with many teares. Yet it ſeemeth to me to be more likely that he ſpeaketh of all in generall.</p>
               <p n="32">32 <hi>I commend you to God.</hi> He vſeth a prayer, which in an oration ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to moue the hearers greatly, ought not to be counted abſurd. For hee did not paſſe for diuiding his Sermon into partes as the Rhetori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians vſe to doe: ſeeing no wordes were ſufficient to expreſſe the vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie of the affections wherewith he was inflamed. He had intreated alreadie of great matters and weightie, which did farre exceed mans a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie.</p>
               <p>Therfore he turneth himſelf vnto prayer, and by litle &amp; litle draweth toward an ende of his ſpeeche: though it be rather an expreſſing of a deſire, then a direct prayer. As if he ſhould haue ſaid, that they be vnable to beare ſo great a burthen: but he doth wiſh to them new helpe from heauen, whereto they may truſt and ouercome all temptations. And it is not to be doubted, though he ſpeake vnto the paſtours alone, but that he doth alſo comprehend the whol church. Firſt he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to God. Secondly to the word of his grace. Notwithſtanding it is all one commendation: but Paul meant to expreſſe the meanes whereby the Lorde doth defende the ſaluation of his, which (as Peter ſaith) is kepte by faith:<note place="margin">1. Pet. 1.5.</note> and the meanes of this keeping dependeth vppon the woord
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:7788:255"/> leaſt it come in hazard amidſt ſo many daungers. And it is very expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for vs to know how God will keep vs. For becauſe his maieſtie is hid from vs, vntill he come vnto vs by his word, we looke too and fro being in doubt.</p>
               <p>Therefore ſo ſoone as he receiueth vs to be kept, he maketh his word the inſtrument to keep our ſaluation, in which ſenſe hee addeth the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunct, Grace (for the Genetiue caſe after the manner of the Hebrewes doth ſignify an effect) to the end the faithful might the more ſafely reſt in the word, where God doth ſhewe foorth his fauour. This expoſition is plaine and apt: for whereas ſome vnderſtand it of Chriſt, it is too much rackt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Who is able to build farther.</hi> The participle <hi>dunamenos,</hi> is to be referred vnto God, not vnto his word. And this conſolatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is added for this cauſe leaſt they faint through the feeling of their infirmities. For ſo long as we be inuironned with the infirmities of the fleſh, we be like to an houſe whoſe foundation is laid. All the godly muſt bee grounded in deede in Chriſt, but their faith is far from being perfect. Yea thogh the foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> continue ſtable &amp; ſure, yet ſome parts of the building be like to fall and quaile. Wherfore there is great need both of continuall building, &amp; alſo now &amp; then new props and ſtayes be neceſſarie. Neuertheles Paul ſaith that we muſt not faint, becauſe the Lord wil not leaue his worke vnfini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed:<note place="margin">Phil. 1.6. Pſal. 138.8.</note> as he doth likewiſe teach in the firſt chapter to the Philippians, He which hath begun a good work in you, will performe it vntill the day of the Lord. Wherto that of the Pſalm anſwereth, thou wilt not forſake the work of our hands. That which is added immediatly concerning the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of life, appertaineth vnto the very inioying of life. So ſoone as Chriſt hath appeared to vs, we paſſe in deed from death to life: &amp; faith is an entrance into the kingdome of heauen: neither is the Spirite of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption giuen to vs in vain: but Paul promiſeth in this place to the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, a continuall encreaſe of grace, vntill they ſee the poſſeſſion of the inheritance whereunto they haue been called, which is now laid vp for them in heauen. He calleth it the power of god not as we vſe to imagine it without effect, but which is commonly called actuall. For the faithfull muſt ſo lay hold vppon it, that they may haue it readie like to a ſhield or buckler to holde vp againſt all aſſaults of Satan. As the Scripture doth teach that we haue ayde enough in the power of God: ſo let vs remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that none are ſtrong in the Lord ſaue thoſe who aba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>doning all hope and confidence of their owne freewill, truſt and leane to him, who, as Paul ſaith very well, is able to build farther.</p>

Whence wee gather that no man can be a good miniſter of the worde, but he muſt alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne money.

Whereunto belongeth that, that hee ſuffered many Churches to miniſter vnto him food and raiment. Neither did he onely freely receiue wages for the worke which he did in any place, of thoſe who were there: but when he was in neceſſitie at Corinthus, hee ſaith that he robbed other Churches to releeue his pouertie. Therefore he doth not ſimply command Paſtours to maintain their life with their handywork: but immediatly after he declareth how far forth he exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth them to follow his example. Thoſe men of Corinthus did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie him that which was due to him: but ſeeing that the falſe Apoſtles did boaſt that they did their worke freely, and gate thereby prayſe among the people: Paul would not be behind them in this point, nor giue them any occaſion to accuſe him falſly: as hee himſelfe affirmeth. 1. Cor. 9.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 9.15, 1. Cor. 11.10.</note> and 2. Cor. 11. Therefore he warneth that there bee no ſtumbling blocke layed in the way of the weake, and that their faith bee not ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwen.

               <p>
                  <hi>And to remember.</hi> We reed this ſentence in no place word for word: but the Euangeliſts haue other not much vnlike this, out of which Paul might gather this. Againe we know that all the ſayinges of Chriſt were not written. And hee repeateth that generall doctrine of the contempt of money. Whereof this is a true token when a man is more bent to giue then to take. Neither did Chriſt ſpeake only politikelie, as if thoſe
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:7788:256"/> who are liberall, are therefore bleſſed, becauſe they binde other men vnto them with their benefites, and it is a kinde of bondage to owe anie thing: but he had reſpect vnto an higher thing, becauſe he which giueth to the poore,<note place="margin">Prou. 19.17</note> lendeth vnto the Lorde: that thoſe be faithful and good ſtewardes of God, who impart to their brethren ſome of that plentie which they haue lent them: that men drawe neerer vnto God in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing then in liberalitie. We doe alſo reade theſe titles of liberality in profane Authours: and a good part of the worlde confeſſe that theſe things are true, but they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent (as it is in the prouerb) with Aſſes eares. For the common life doth ſhewe howe few be perſwaded that nothing ought more to be wiſhed, then that we beſtow our goods to helpe our brethren. For which cauſe the Diſciples of Chriſt muſt more ſtudiouſly thinke vpon this felicitie, that abſtaining ſo much as in them lieth, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that which is an other mans, they accuſtome themſelues to giue. And yet they muſt not doe this with an hawty heart, as if it were a miſerable thing for them to be in any mans danger: either through ambition, that they may binde other men to them: but onely that they may exerciſe themſelues willingly in the duties of loue: and by this meanes make knowne the grace of their Adoption.</p>
               <p n="36">36 <hi>And kneeling downe.</hi> The inward affection is in deed the chiefeſt thing in prayer: yet the external ſignes, as kneeling, vncouering of the head, lifting vp of the hands, haue a double vſe: the firſt is, that we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe all our members to the glorie and worſhip of God: ſecondly that by this exerciſe our ſluggiſhnes may be awaked as it were. There is alſo a thirde vſe in ſolemne and publike prayer, becauſe the children of God do by this meanes make profeſſion of their godlineſſe, and one of them doth prouoke another vnto the reuerence of God. And as the lifting vp of the hands is a token of boldneſſe and of an earneſt deſire, ſo to teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie our humilitie wee fall downe vpon our knees. But he ſealeth vp and concludeth that ſermon which he made before with prayer: becauſe we can hope for no profite of our doctrine ſaue onely from the bleſſing of God. Wherefore if we be deſirous to do any good by teaching, admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing &amp; exhorting, let vs alwayes end after this ſort: to wit, with prayer.</p>
               <p n="37">37 <hi>Great weeping.</hi> No maruell if all the godly did intirely loue this holy man. For it had been a point of too groſſe vnthankfulneſſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpice him who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Lord had ſo beautified with ſo many excellent gifts. And the chief cauſe of their weeping was, as Luke noteth, becauſe they ſhould ſee him no more. For they did bewayle their owne condition, &amp; the condition of all the whole church of Aſia not in vaine, which they ſaw to be depriued of an ineſtimable treaſure. And when the Spirit com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth their teares by the mouth of Luke, as witneſſes of ſincere godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, he condemneth the raſhnes of thoſe who require at the hands of the faithful hard and cruel conſtancie. For that is falſe whereof they dreame that thoſe affections proceed only of corruption, which we haue naturally from God. Wherefore the perfection of the faithful conſiſteth not in this, that they put off all affections: but that they be moued ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with only for iuſt cauſes, and that they moderate the ſame.</p>

Let vs ſearch the deſcribers of countries touching the ſituation of the cities wherof he maketh mention, it is ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for me to ſhew Luke his purpoſe.</p>
               <p n="4">4 <hi>And when they had found diſciples.</hi> Though the number of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full was but ſmall, yet there came ſome ſeed of the goſpel thither, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the propheſies of the prophetes, leaſt Tyrus ſhuld be altogether void of the bleſſing of God. And here as in other places going before,<note place="margin">Eſai. 23.18.</note> Luke calleth chriſtians diſciples, that wee may knowe that thoſe alone are numbred in the flocke of Chriſt, who haue imbraced his doctrine by faith. For that is a vain &amp; falſe profeſſion for a man to giue his name to Chriſt, &amp; not to vnderſtand what he teacheth or ſpeaketh. And let the Readers mark, that Paul ſtaied ſeuen dayes at Tyrus for no other cauſe, ſauing that he might ſtrengthen them. So that we ſee, that whither ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer he came, he foreſlowed no occaſion to doe good.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They ſaid by the ſpirit.</hi> Namely with the approbation of ſpeeche, that Paul might know that they ſpake by the Spirite of propheſie. Surely this was no ſmal temptation, to cauſe him not to finiſh the iourney which he had taken in hand, ſeeing the holy ghoſt diſt diſuade him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſame.
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:7788:257"/> And this was a very faire colour to flie from the croſſe, if hee had cared for his own ſafetie, to be drawen backe as it were with the hand of God. Notwithſtanding he ceaſeth not to hold on thither whither he knew he was called by the Lord. Notwithſtanding heere ariſeth a queſtion, howe the brethren can diſuade him by the Spirit from doing that, which Paul did teſtifie he doth by the ſecret motion of the ſame ſpirit? Is the Spirit contrary to himſelfe, that he doth now looſe Paul whom he held bound inwardly? I anſwere that there be diuers giftes of the Spirite: ſo that it is no maruell if thoſe who excell in the gift of propheſie bee ſome times deſtitute of iudgement or ſtrength. The Lord ſhewed to theſe brethren of whom Luke maketh mention, what ſhould come to paſſe: yet neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe they know not what is expedient and what Paul his calling doth require, becauſe the meaſure of their gift doth not reach ſo farre. And the Lorde woulde haue his ſeruaunt admoniſhed of purpoſe, partly that through long meditation he might be better furniſhed and prepared to ſuffer whatſoeuer ſhoulde come, partly that his conſtancie might more plainely appeare, when as being certified by propheſies of the dolefull euent, he doth notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding wittingly and willlingly make haſt to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure whatſoeuer things ſhall befall him.</p>

               <p n="7">7 Luke doth briefly declare that Paul was alſo receiued at <hi>Ptolomais</hi> by the brethren. This is a citie of <hi>Phenicia,</hi> ſtanding vppon the ſea coaſt, not farre from the borders of Iudea, from which Paul and his compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons had no long iourney to Ceſarea. But if the readers bee diſpoſed to knowe farther touching the ſcituation of regions, let them reſort vnto the deſcribers of places and countries. Furthermore he ſaith, that when he came to Ceſarea, they lodged with Philip, whom he calleth an Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt. Though he were one of the ſeuen deacons,<note place="margin">Ch. 6.5.</note> as we may ſee in the ſixte chapter. By this wee may eaſily gather, that that Deaconſhippe was an office which continued but for a time; becauſe it had not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe beene lawfull for Philip to forſake Ieruſalem, and to goe to Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarea. And in this place he is ſet before vs not as a voluntary forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of his office, but as one to whom a greater and more excellent charge was committed. The Euangeliſts in my iudgement were in the midſt betweene Apoſtles and docters. For it was a function next to the Apoſtles, to preach the Goſpel in all places, and not to haue any certain place of abode: onely the degree of honour was inferiour. For when Paul deſcribeth the order of the Church, he doth ſo put them after the Apoſtles that hee ſheweth that they haue more roomth giuen them where they may teach, than the Paſtours,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4.11.</note> who are tyed to certaine places. Therefore Philip did for a time exerciſe the office of a Deacon at Ieruſalem: whom the Church thought afterward to be a meete man, to whom the treaſure of the Goſpel ſhould be commited.</p>
               <p n="9">9 <hi>Fower daughters.</hi> This is added for the commendation of Philip: not onely that we might know that his houſe was well ordered, but alſo that it was famous and excellent through the bleſſing of God. For aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly it was no ſmall gift to haue fower daughters, all endewed with the ſpirit of prophecie.</p>
               <p>By this meanes the Lorde meant to bewtifie the firſt beginnings of the Goſpel, when hee raiſed vp men and women, to foretell thinges to com. Propheſies had now almoſt ceaſed many yeres among the Iewes to the end they might bee more attentiue &amp; deſirous to heare the newe voice of the Goſpell. Therefore ſeeing that propheſiyng which was in a manner quite ceaſed, doth nowe after long time returne againe, it was a token of a more perfect ſtate. Notwithſtanding it ſeemeth that the ſame was the reaſon why it ceaſed ſhortly after: for God did ſupport the old people with diuers foretellings, vntill Chriſt ſhoulde make an ende of all propheſies. Therefore it was meete that the newe kingdome of Chriſte ſhoulde bee thus furniſhed and beautified with this furniture that all men myght knowe that that promiſed viſitation of the Lorde was preſent: and it was alſo expedient that it ſhoulde laſt but for a ſhort time leaſt the faithfull ſhoulde alwayes waite for ſome farther thinge, or leaſte that curious wittes myght haue occaſion giuen
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:7788:258"/> to ſeek or inuent ſome new thing euer now and then. For we know that when that abilitie and skil was taken away, there were notwithſtanding many brainſicke fellowes, who did boaſt that they were prophets, &amp; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo it may be that the frowardnes of men did depriue the Church of this gift. But that one cauſe ought to be ſufficient, in that God by taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way prophecies, did teſtifie that the end and perfection was preſent in Chriſt: &amp; it is vncertaine how theſe maids did execute the office of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecying: ſauing that the ſpirit of God did ſo guide and gouerne them, that he did not ouerthrow the order which he himſelfe ſet down. And for as much as he doth not ſuffer women to beare any publike office in the church, it is to be thought that they did prophecie at home, or in ſome priuate place without the common aſſembly.</p>
               <p n="10">10 <hi>A certaine Prophet.</hi> Though Luke doth not plainlie expreſſe the ſame, yet do I coniect that this Agabus was the ſame of whom mention is made in the xi. chapter, who foretold that there ſhould be famin vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the reigne of Claudius Caeſar.<note place="margin">Sap. 11.28.</note> And whenas Luke calleth him a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet as of late he called the four daughters of Philip, he ſignifieth that it was not a common but a peculiar gift. Now we muſt ſee to what ende the perſecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which was at hand was now again ſhewed by Agabus. As concerning Paul he was ſufficiently told alreadie. Therefore I doe not doubt but that this confirmation was added for other mens ſake: bicauſe the Lord meant euery where to make knowen the bonds of his ſeruant partly that they might know that he entred the combat willingly partly that they might perceiue that he was appointed of god to be a cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pion to fight for the goſpell. It was ſurely a profitable example of inuincible conſtancie, ſeeing that he offered himſelf willingly and wittingly to the violence of the aduerſaries: and no leſſe profitable is it for vs at this day, that his apoſtleſhip ſhould be confirmed with this voluntarie &amp; no leſſe conſtant giuing ouer of his life.</p>

Theſe and ſuch like might ſeeme to the common ſort to be toies: but the ſame ſpirite who did apply ſignes to his woordes, did inwardly touch the hearts of the godly, as if they had bin brought to the very thing it ſelfe. So this ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle mentioned by Luke, did no leſſe mooue Paul his companions, then if they had ſeene him bound in deed. The falſe prophets did after<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ward aſſay to delude the ſimple by this pollicie, as Satan is in a manner Gods ape: and his miniſters do enuie the ſeruauntes of God. Zedechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as made himſelfe hornes, wherewith he promiſed Syria ſhould be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed.

               <p>But foraſmuch as there was in them no force of the Spirite, their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie did no whit hurt the faithfull. This is alſo worthie to be noted, that Agabus doth not ſet before their eies a dumb ſpectacle, but he coupleth therewith the worde, whereby he may ſhew to the faithfull the vſe and end of the ceremonie.</p>
               <p n="12">12 <hi>Both we.</hi> Bicauſe they had not al one reuelatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it is no maruel if their iudgements were diuers. For ſeeing theſe holy men knew, that ther con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted much in the life or death of one man, they would not haue him to come in danger raſhly. And their deſire is worthie praiſe, in that they de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſired to prouide for the common ſafetie of the church, by keeping back Paul. But on the otherſide Paul his conſtancie deſerueth ſo much the more praiſe, when as he continueth ſo ſtedfaſt in the calling of god. For he was not ignorant what great trouble he ſhuld ſuffer, by reaſon of his bands. But becauſe he knoweth the will of God, which was his only rule in taking counſell, he maketh no account of all other thinges, that hee may follow it. And aſſuredly we muſt bee ſo ſubiect to the will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God, that no profit, no kind of reaſon may remoue vs from obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him. When Paul doth reprehend the brethren, becauſe they afflict his hart with weeping, he doth ſufficiently declare that he was not har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened, but that hee was brought vnto ſome feeling and ſuffering toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with them. Therefore the teares of the godly did wounde his heart: but that ſoftneſſe did not turne him out of the way, but that hee procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to follow God with a ſtreight courſe. Therfore we muſt vſe ſuch cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie toward our brethren, that the beck or will of God haue alwayes the vpper hand.

               <p n="18">18 <hi>All the Elders were preſent.</hi> We may gather that out of this place, which we had already in the fifteenth chapter. So often as any weighty buſines was to be handeled, the Elders were wont to come togither, to the end the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſultatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> might be more quiet without the multitude. We ſhal ſee anon, that the people were likewiſe admitted in their order: yet after that the elders had had their ſecret co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſultation among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues.</p>
               <p n="19">19 And now Paul ſheweth his modeſty when he doth not make him ſelf the Author of thoſe things which he had done: but giuing the praiſe to God, doth cal himſelf onlie the miniſter, whoſe induſtry God had v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. As we muſt graunt, that whatſoeuer thing is excellent and woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy praiſe, it is not done by our owne power, but for as much as GOD doth woorke in vs: &amp; eſpecially touching the edifying of the church. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, it appeareth how farre off the elders were from enuy, when they glorifie God for the ioyful ſucceſſe. But becauſe mention is made of no other Apoſtle beſides Iames, we may coniect that they were gone into diuers places to ſpread abroade and preach the Goſpel, as their calling did require. For the Lord had not appointed them to ſtay ſtil at Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem: but after they had made a beginning there, he commandeth them to goe into Iudea and other partes of the world. Moreouer, the errour of thoſe men, who thinke that Iames was one of the diſciples who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Paul numbreth among the three pillers of the church, is refuted before in the fifteenth chapter. And thogh the ſame commandement was giuen to him which was giuen to the reſt of his fellowes in office: yet I do not doubt but that they did ſo diuide them ſelues, that Iames ſtood ſtil at Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, whither many ſtrangers were woont daily to reſort. For that was all one as if he had preached the Goſpel farre and wide in ſtrange places.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thou ſeeſt brother how many thouſands.</hi> This Oration or ſpeeche hath two members. For firſt the Elders ſay, that ſo many of the Iewes as were conuerted, ſeing they be earneſt folowers of the law, are euil affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted towarde Paul, becauſe they thinke that hee indeuoureth wyth might and mayne to aboliſhe the lawe. Secondly, they exhort hym that making a ſolemne vowe he purge himſelfe, that he may not be had in ſuſpition anie longer. They obiect to Paul the multitude of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, that he may the more willingly yeeld to them. For if they had byn a few ſtubborne fellowes, he would not haue bin ſo muche moued. But now he may not neglect both much people, and the whole bodie of the Church.</p>
               <pb n="500" facs="tcp:7788:260"/>
               <p>Vndoubtedly that zeale of the law which was in them was corrupt: and aſſuredly eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the very elders declare ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly that they like it not. For thogh they do not condemn it openly, neither ſharply complaine of the ſame, yet bicauſe they ſeparat the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues from their affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confeſſe that they erre. If it had been a zeale according to knowledge it ought to haue begun at them: but they contend not for the law it ſelf, neither do they pretend the due reuerence therof, neither do they ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to thoſe who are earneſt followers of it. Therefore they both ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie that they are of another mind, and alſo that they doe not allow the ſuperſtition of the people. Notwithſtanding, it is obiected, that they ſaie that Paul was burdened with a falſe report or ſlaunder. Againe, when they require at his hands ſatisfaction, they ſeem to nouriſh that zeale. I anſwere, that though that were a true report in ſome reſpect wherewith the Iewes were offended, yet was it mixed with a ſlaunder. Paul did ſo teach the abrogating of the law, that notwithſtanding by this meanes the authority therof did not only continue ſound and perfect, but it was more holie. For as we ſaid in the 7. chapter, the ceremonies ſhould be vayne, vnleſſe the effect thereof had beene ſhewed in Chriſt. Therefore thoſe who ſay that they were aboliſhed by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of Chriſt, are ſo farre from being blaſphemous againſt the lawe, that they rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the trueth thereof. We muſt conſider two thinges in ceremonies: the trueth, whereto is annexed the efficacie: ſecondly, the externall vſe. Furthermore, the abrogating of the external vſe, which Chriſt brought dependeth herevpon, in that he is the ſound body, &amp; that nothing was ſhadowed in times paſt, which is not fulfilled in him. This diffreth much from the falling away from the law, to ſhew the true ende thereof, that the figures may haue an end, and that the ſpirituall trueth thereof may alwaies be in force. Wherefore we ſee that they were malitious and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt interpreters, who laid Apoſtacie to Paul his charge, though he dyd call awaie the faithfull from the externall woorſhippe of the Lawe. And whereas they command Paul to make a vowe to that ende, that he may proue himſelfe to be a keeper of the lawe, it tendeth to no other ende, ſauing that he may teſtifie that he doth not deteſt the Lawe like a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Apoſtata, who did himſelfe ſhake off the Lordes yoke, and moue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers vnto the like rebellion.</p>

But now knowing the grace of Chriſte it is growen vp, that it may be fre from ceremonies, in that place he ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vndoutedlie both of the Iewes &amp; Gentiles. Alſo when he ſaith,<note place="margin">Gal. 2.14.</note> that the handwriting of the law, which did conſiſt in decrees, is blotted out and nayled to the croſſe by Chriſte, he ſetteth free the Iewes as well as the Gentiles from the ceremonies, which he calleth in that place de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees. But ſeeing that hee did not preciſely reiecte ceremonies, in teaching that the comming of Chriſt did make an end of the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing thereof: that was no reuolting, as the enuious Iewes thought it to be. Neither were the Elders ignorant of Paul his libertie. Therefore ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they vnderſtand the matter very well, their meaning is to haue this alone made known to the rude and vnskilfull, that Paul meant nothing leſſe, then to perſuade the Iews to contemne the law. Therfore they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold not the bare matter, but knowing what the common ſort thought of Paul by reaſon of the reports, which went about co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning him, they ſeek to cure the ſame. Thogh I wote not whether this were more impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate then equal, which they required at Paul his hands. And by this it appeareth how prepoſterous the crueltie of men is in receiuing falſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports and how faſt a falſe opinion once raſhly receiued, doth ſtick. It is certain that Iames and his fellowes in office did indeuour to maintaine &amp; defend Paul his good report, &amp; to put away thoſe lies which did hurt his eſtimation: yet let them doe what they can, they will ſpeake euill of Paul. Vnleſſe peraduenture they were too ſlacke in the beginning, that they might gratifie their countrie men: ſo that they were not their own men afterward.</p>
               <p n="22">22 <hi>The multitude muſt needes come together.</hi> The verb is a verb neuter, as if they ſhould ſay, the multitude muſt of neceſſitie com together. For it had been an abſurd thing that an apoſtle of ſuch rare report ſhoulde not come before the whole multitude of the faithfull. For if hee had eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chewed the light and ſight of people, the ſiniſter ſuſpition might haue byn increaſed. Neuertheleſſe we ſee how modeſtly the Elders behaued themſelues in nouriſhing concord, when as they preuent the offence of the people in time, ſauing that they beare too much peraduenture with their infirmitie, in requiring a vow of Paul. But this moderation muſt be kept in the church, that the paſtours bee in great authoritie, &amp; yet that they rule not proudly as Lords, neither deſpice the reſt of the body. For the diſtinction of orders, which is the bond of peace, ought not to bee any cauſe of diſcention.</p>
               <p n="23">23 <hi>Doe that which we ſay to thee.</hi> The Elders ſeeme (as I ſaid euen now) to be faln vnto a fooliſh pa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pering through too much loue of their natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But the manifeſt iudgement of that thing dependeth vpon the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, which are hid fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs at this day: yet they knew the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wel. The whol body almoſt did conſiſt vppon Iewes, ſo that they needed not to feare the offending of the Gentiles. For in other regions this was the cauſe of departure, becauſe euery man was wedded to his own cuſtome, &amp; would preſcribe a law to others. Furthermore they had at Ieruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> many things which might prouoke them to keepe the ceremonies of the law, ſo that
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:7788:261"/> they had a greater excuſe, if they did more ſlowly forſake them. And thogh their zeale wer not void of fault, yet as it was an hard matter to reform it, ſo it could not be don at a ſodain. We ſee how this ſuperſtitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was ſcarce in long time pulled from the apoſtles: &amp; bicauſe new diſciples came daily vnto the faith, the infirmitie was nouriſhed in all together. And yet notwithſtanding we muſt not deny but that ignorance was cou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pled with obſtinacie, which the Elders did neuertheleſſe tollerate, leaſt they ſhuld do more hurt by vſing violent remedies. I leaue it indifferent whether they did paſſe meaſure or no.</p>

                  <hi>Hauing a vow vpon them.</hi> Though theſe foure be reckoned among the faithful, yet their vow was ſuperſtitious. Wherby it appeareth that the apoſtles had much trouble in that natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which was not only hardned in the worſhip of the law through long vſe: but was alſo naturally malipart, &amp; almoſt intractable. Though it may be that theſe men were as yet but nouices: &amp; therefore their faith was yet but ſlender &amp; ſcarce well fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, wherefore the doctors did ſuffer them to performe the vow which they had vnaduiſedly made. As touching Paul, bicauſe he made this vow not moued thereunto by his owne conſcience, but for their ſakes, with whoſe error he did bear, the caſe ſtood otherwiſe with him. Notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding we muſt ſee,<note place="margin">Sap. 18.18.</note> whether this were one of the indifferent ceremonies, which the faithful might omit or keep at their pleſure. It ſemeth indeed to haue in it certain thinges, which did not agree with the profeſſion of faith. But bicauſe the end therof was thankſgiuing (as we ſaid before in the 18. cha.) &amp; there was nothing in the rite it ſelf repugna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to the faith of Chriſt:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 9.20.</note> Paul did not dout to deſcend thus far, to make his religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen. Therefore Paul did that which he ſaith of himſelf elswher: becauſe he made himſelf a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of thoſe which followed the law, as if he him ſelf were in ſubiection to the law. Finally hee was made all things to all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that he might win all: to wit, euen vnto the altars, ſo that he might pollute himſelfe with no ſacrilege vnder a colour of loue. It had not bin ſo lawfull for him to go vnto the ſolemne ſacrifice of ſatisfaction. But as for this part of the worſhip of God, which conſiſted in a vow, hee might do it indifferently: ſo it were not done for religions ſake, but only to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the weeke. But it was neither his intent to worſhip God with this rite, neither was his conſcience tied, but he did freley ſubmit himſelf to his weak brethren.</p>
               <p n="24">24 <hi>Which they haue heard of thee are nothing.</hi> They ſeem to perſuade Paul to diſſemble. For the rumor roſe not vpon nothing, that he did call away the Iewes from the ceremonies, and that he did not walk in obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the law. But we muſt remember that which I ſaid euen now, that it was ſufficient for Paul and the Elders, if they could remoue the ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which was vniuſtly raiſed, to wit, that he was a reuolt from the lawe: and there might a better opportunitie be offred ſhortly, that in purging himſelfe hee might call them backe by little and little from their error. Neither was it good or profitable that Paull ſhoulde be counted an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruer of the lawe any long time, as the diſciples were then commonlie: for by this meanes a thick veile ſhould haue been put before their eyes,
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:7788:261"/> to darken the light of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Wherfore let vs know that Paul did not diſſemble, but ſincerely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that he did not hate the law: but that he did rather thinke reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently of it. They will him to beſtow coſt together with them, becauſe they were wont to put their money together, that they might offer ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice together.</p>

               <p n="26">26 Whereas ſome accuſe Paule of ſubtletie, as if hee did playe the Hypocrite, I haue before refuted this. Yet I doe not denie but that he graunted to do thus much at the requeſt of the brethren, being ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto in a manner enforced. Therfore it hath more colour, and is (as they ſay) more diſputable, that he was too eaſily intreated; and too ready to obey: and yet I doe not admit that which ſome men ſay, that it went not wel with Paul, becauſe taking vpon him a new and vnwonted perſon, he did not ſo conſtantly as he was woont mainteine the liberty purchaſed by Chriſte. I confeſſe indeede that God doth oftentimes puniſh fooliſh purpoſes with vnhappy ſucceſſe: but I ſee not why this ſhould be applied
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:7788:262"/> to Paul, who through volu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tary ſubiection ſought to win the fauor of the rude &amp; ſuch as were not throughly inſtructed, that he might doe them good: being about to doe that, not willingly, but becauſe he had rather yeeld to the brethren, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſtick to his own iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Furthermore, when he was once admitted, he might fitly haue paſſed ouer to moderate that zeale.

He might wel haue reproued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, becauſe they had bin ſo ready to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue reports contrarie to his eſtimation. In that he abſtaineth, he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth great patience: in that he winneth their fauour ſo carefully, it is ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guler modeſty. Moreouer, he might haue been more rough and rounde with Iames &amp; his fellowes in office, becauſe they had not bin more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent to root out errors from among the people. For though it be certain that they taught faithfully: yet it may be that the ſight of the temple, &amp; the verie feare of the lawe did hinder them in defending the vſe of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie. But Paul whether he went from his right of his own accord, or whether he thinke that they ſee better what is expedient, then he, doth follow their counſel.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Paul, goe about to colour their trecherous diſſimulation, whiles they pollute themſelues with al filthines of popery, it needeth no long refutation. They boaſt that they do this to win the weake brethren, or that they follow their veine thus farre, as if Paul did yeeld to them in all things without choiſe. If being Iewes they ſhould take vppon them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the preſcript of the law, to fulfil among the Iewes a vowe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect with no idolatrie, then might they proue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to be like Paul.

               <p n="27">27 <hi>The Iewes which came from Aſia.</hi> It is certaine that theſe men were enimies to the name of Chriſt and of Chriſtians, ſo that whiles Paul is bent to pacifie the faithful, he incurreth the rage of the enimies.

But this place teacheth, that we muſt not take it impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently, if at any time our hope be fruſtrate, and our counſels which we haue taken with a right and holy affection fall not out well, that our actions may haue an happie end. We muſt attempt nothing, but with a good conſcience and according to the Spirite of God. But and if things come not to paſſe as wee would euen then, let that inward feeling vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold vs, that we know that God alloweth our deſire, though it be laide open to the reproches and mockes of men: neither let it repent vs of our gentlenes, if at any time the wicked reward vs otherwiſe than wee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue.</p>

<pb n="505" facs="tcp:7788:262"/> againſt Paul, onely becauſe in ſhewing that the full and perfite truth is found in Chriſt, he taught that the figures of the Law had an end. Now whereas they conceiue a falſe opinion hauing ſeene Trophymus, they do more bewray by this headlong lightnes how venemous they be. They accuſe Paul of ſacrilege. Why? becauſe he brought into the Temple a man which was vncircumciſed. But they laid a moſt cruell crime to the charge of an innocent through a falſe opinion. Thus the boldneſſe of thoſe men vſeth commonly to bee prepoſterous, who are carried away with an opinion conceiued before. But let vs learne by ſuch examples to beware of the diſtemperature of affections, and not to let light preiudices haue the raine, leaſt we runne headlong vpon the innocent, being carried with blind force.</p>

For in this corruption of nature, frowardnes is ioined with fooliſhnes: ſo that thoſe will readily of their owne accord make haſte to maintaine an euil cauſe, who can hardly be moued with many exhortations to do well. This is a hard caſe, that the whole world ſhould be armed againſt vs at a ſodaine through the perſwaſion of a fewe: but ſeeing it pleaſeth the Lorde it ſhould bee ſo, let euery one of vs prepare himſelfe by this and ſuch like examples to ſuffer all manner aſſaults and to beare and abide albrunts.</p>

Wee muſt thus thinke with our ſelues, that Sathan doth pricke forward the enimies of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, leaſt their rage how cruell and troubleſome ſo euer it be, trouble vs. On the otherſide appeareth the wonderfull goodnes of God, when as he raiſeth vp the chiefe captaine at a ſodaine, that hee may deliuer Paul from death. He himſelfe thought vpon no ſuch thing, but he came to appeaſe the tumult which was raiſed among the people: but the Lord ſheweth a more euident token of his prouidence, becauſe Paul his life was deliuered from ſuch preſent danger without mans counſell. Thus doth he ſuffer the faithful not only to labor, but to be almoſt oppreſſed, that hee may deliuer them from death more wonderfully.

And whether the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers did lift vp Paul on high that they might bring him ſafe to the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or campe, or he was thus toſt with the violence of the crowde, this was no dutie of fauour. But the greater the crueltie of thoſe which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him was, God did more plainly declare that he was fauourable to his ſeruant in ſparing his life, leaſt if hee ſhould haue been murdered in the tumult, his death ſhould haue wanted due frute.</p>
               <p n="37">37 <hi>May I ſpeake vnto thee.</hi> Paul offered himſelfe to defend his cauſe which all the ſeruaunts of God muſt do. For wee muſt doe our indeuour to make our integritie knowen to all men leaſt through our infamie the name of God bee blaſphemed. But when the chief captain demandeth whether Paul be not that Egyptia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which was a murtherer, which a litle before had ledde away a companie of men, let vs learne that how mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly and quietly ſoeuer the miniſters of Chriſt, behaue themſelues, and howeſoeuer they bee voide of all fault, yet cannot they eſcape the reproches and ſlaunders of the worlde. Whiche thing wee muſt note for this cauſe, that wee maye acquaint our ſelues with rebukes: and that in well dooyng wee may bee prepared too bee euill ſpoken of. When hee asketh him concerning the Egyptian, he meaneth not Theudas the ſorcerer, as ſome men falſly ſuppoſe: of whom Gama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liel made mention before in the fift Chapter,<note place="margin">Ch. 5.37.</note> and of whom Ioſephus ſpeaketh more in his twentieth of antiquities. For beſides that wee reade there that Theudas carried awaie onelie foure hundred menne, and the chiefe Captaine reckoneth vp in this place foure thouſande, and ſaith that they were all murtherers: that is more, in that Theu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das raiſed that faction during the reigne of Tiberius or Auguſtus Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar, whereof remained onlie an obſcure report: becauſe ſo ſoone as a troupe of horſemen was ſent after them, they were forthwith deſtroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Notwithſtanding it ſeemeth to me that Ioſephus is deceiued in that where he ſaith firſt that Cuſpius Fadus was ſent by Claudius, and then hee addeth that Theudas was of him ouercome: ſeing I haue before ſhewed that that former inſurrection was made at ſuch time as Claudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us was but a priuate man.</p>
               <p>Though he diſagree much with Lukes narration euen in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, ſeing he ſaieth that there were about thirtie thouſand made part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in the ſedition: vnleſſe happily we expound it thus, that after hee was put to flight by Felix, he fled into the wilderneſſe with fower thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand. And it had bin an abſurd thing that the number ſhould be made ten times greater, as alſo that a troupe hauing no skill in warre or being altogither without courage ſhoulde haue bene defamed with the name of murderers. For as Ioſephus doeth witneſſe, that ſeducer had decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the ſimple and credulous common people with falſe promiſes,
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:7788:264"/> boaſting that he was a prophet of God which would lead the people dry foote through the midſt of Iordane. But the ſame Ioſephus putteth the matter out of doubt, when hee ſaith that an Egiptian a prophet did ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther together a band of men, vnder Foelix the preſident and did carry them into mount Oliuet: whereof foure hundred were ſlaine, two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred taken, and the reſidue diſpearſed. The hiſtorie was freſh in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie. Againe, foraſmuch as the authour of the ſedition was eſcaped: &amp; the region filled with murtherers, it is not without cauſe that the chiefe captaine demaundeth of Paul, when he ſeeth all men ſo hate him, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he were that Egiptian. Luke recordeth no longer conference had betweene the chiefe captain and Paul: yet it is likely, foraſmuch as both of them vnderſtood the Greeke tong, that they had farther talk Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it came to paſſe, that ſo ſoone as Paul had wel purged himſelf, he had licence graunted him to ſpeake to the people. For the chiefe captaine would neuer haue ſuffered a wicked man to make any publik ſpeech in a citie, which was ſo ſore ſuſpected.</p>

               </q>
               <p n="2">2 Though wee may geſſe by the beginning of this ſpeech, what was Paul his drift: yet becauſe he was interrupted, we know not certainelie what hee was about to ſay. The ſumme of that part which is reſited is this, that, Foraſmuch as he was well and faithfully inſtructed in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Law, he was a godlie and religious worſhiper of God in the ſight of the world. Secondly that hee was an enimie to the Goſpell of Chriſt, ſo that hee was counted among the prieſts one of the principall maintainers and defenders of the Law. Thirdly that he did not change his ſect vnaduiſedly: but that being tamed and conuict by an Oracle from heauen, he gaue his name to Chriſt. Fourthly that he did not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace vnknowne things, but that God appointed him a faithful teacher, of whom he learned al things perfectly. Laſtly that when he was retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to Ieruſalem, and ſought to doe good to his countrimen, God did
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:7788:264"/> not permit him. So that he brought not the doctrine of ſaluation vnto forraine nations without good conſideration, or becauſe hee hated his owne nation, but being commanded by God ſo to do.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Men, Brethren and fathers.</hi> It is a wonder that hee giueth ſo great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour yet to the deſperate enimies of the Goſpel: for they had broken al bonde of brotherly fellowſhip, and by oppreſſing the glory of God, had ſpoiled themſelues of all titles of dignitie. But becauſe Paule ſpeaketh in this place as ſome one of the people, he ſpeaketh ſo louingly vnto the bodie it ſelfe, and vſeth towards the heads words honourable, without diſſembling: and ſurely becauſe their caſting off was not made knowne as yet, though they were vnworthie of any honour, yet it was meete that Paul ſhould reuerently acknowledge in them the grace of Gods a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption. Therefore in that he calleth them Brethren and Fathers, hee doth not ſo much regard what they haue deſerued, as into what degree of honour God had exalted them. And all his Oration is ſo framed, that hee goeth about to ſatiſfie them freely in deede and without flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering, yet humblie and meekely. Therefore let vs learne ſo to reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and honour men, that wee impaire not Gods right. For which cauſe the Popes pride is the more deteſtable, who ſeing hee hath made himſelfe an high Prieſt without the commaundement of God, and the conſent of the Church: he doth not onely chalenge to himſelfe all titles of honour, but alſo ſuch tyrannie that hee goeth about to bring Chriſt in ſubiection, as if when God doeth exalt men, he did reſigne vp his right and authoritie to them, and did ſtoupe downe to them.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>That he ſpake Hebrue.</hi> This is in deede an vſuall thing, that when men which ſpeake diuerſe languages are togither, we heare thoſe more willingly who ſpeake our owne language: but the Iewes were mooued with an other peculiar cauſe, becauſe they imagined that Paul was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with his owne kinred, ſo that hee did euen hate their tongue, or that he was ſome roge which had not ſo much as learned the ſpeech of that nation whereof he ſaid he came. Nowe ſo ſoone as they heard their owne language, they beginne to haue ſome better hope. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more it is vncertaine whether Paul ſpake in the Hebrew or in the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian tongue: for wee knowe that the ſpeech of the Iewes was cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and degenerate after their exile, for as much as they had much from the Chaldeans and Syrians. For mine owne part I thinke, that becauſe hee ſpake as wel to the common ſort as vnto the Elders, he vſed the common ſpeech which was at that day vſuall.</p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>I am a Iewe.</hi> As all things were out of order at that day among the Iewes, manie roges and vagabounds, to the ende they might haue ſome ſhrowd for their wickedneſſe, did falſely boaſt that they were Iewes. Therefore to the ende Paule may acquite himſelfe of this ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition, hee beginneth at his byrth: that done hee declareth that hee was knowne in Ieruſalem, becauſe he was brought vp there of a childe: though this latter thing ſeemeth to bee ſpoken not onely for certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſake: but becauſe it skilled much that this ſhould alſo bee knowne, how well he had bin inſtructed.</p>
               <pb n="510" facs="tcp:7788:265"/>
               <p>There is nothing more bolde to cauſe trouble than vnlearned men. And at that day the gouernement of the Church was ſo decayed, that religion was not onely ſubiect to ſectes, but alſo miſerablie mangled and torne in peeces. Therefore Paul nameth his maſter leaſt any man may thinke that he had not beene nouſled vp in learning, and therefore had hee forſaken the worſhippe of the fathers. As many men who are not trained vp in learning, forget their nature and growe out of kinde. But Paul ſaieth chiefely that he was well taught in the Law, that the Iewes may vnderſtande, that it was not through ignorance (as it falleth out oftentimes) that hee cauſeth ſuch adoe, and doeth counterfaite their monſters.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Chap. 5.34.</note>It is to bee doubted whether this bee that Gamaliel of whom men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made before. Schollars are ſaide to ſit at their maſters feete: becauſe foraſmuch as they bee not as yet of ſtronge and ſound iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they muſt bring ſuch modeſtie and aptneſſe to bee taught, that they muſt make all their ſenſes ſubiect to their maſters, and muſt depende vppon their mouth. So Marie is ſaide to ſit at Ieſus his feete,<note place="margin">Luk. 10.39.</note> when ſhee giueth eare to his doctrine. But and if ſuch reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence bee dew to earthly maſters, howe much more ought wee to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate our ſelues before the feete of Chriſt, that wee may giue eare to him when hee teacheth vs out of his heauenly throne? This ſpeech doeth alſo put boyes and younge men in remembraunce of their duetie, that they bee not ſtoute nor ſtubberne, or that they bee not puffed nor lifted vp againſt their maſters through ſome fooliſh confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, but that they ſuffer themſelues quietly and gently to be framed by them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Taught in the Lawe of the Fathers.</hi> The olde interpreter doeth tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late it worde for worde, Taught according to the trueth of the Fathers Lawe: ſauing that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is rather a perfect way than trueth. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the queſtion is, What hee meaneth by this perfect way, ſeeing all of them had one and the ſame forme of the Lawe. Hee ſeemeth to mee to diſtinguiſh that purer forme of knowledge where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in hee had beene trayned vp, from the common inſtruction, which did more diſagree with the true and naturall meaning of the Lawe. And although the Lawe of the Lorde was then corrupt by manie ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions euen among the beſt Docters: yet becauſe religion was alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither there corrupt among manie; Paul doeth for good cauſes boaſt that hee was both well and alſo diligently inſtructed in the Lawe of the Fathers: or (which is all one) Exactly or perfectly, leaſt any man ſhould thinke, that he had forgotten onely ſome ſmal ſmattering, as if he were one of the common ſorte.</p>
               <p>But becauſe manie who are well taught, are notwithſtanding full ſtufte with Epicuriſh contempt of God, hee declareth that hee was zealous towarde God: as if hee ſhoulde ſay that the ſerious ſtudie of godlineſſe was annexed to doctrine, ſo that hee meant not to dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in holy thinges, as prophane men doe of ſet purpoſe confounde all things.</p>
               <pb n="511" facs="tcp:7788:265"/>
               <p>But becauſe this his zeale was altogether raſh, hee maketh himſelf like to the other Iewes for that time. Notwithſtanding this may be taken in good part, that he did long ago no leſſe worſhip god from his heart then they did then.</p>
               <p n="4">4 <hi>I perſecuted this way.</hi> This is the ſecond point, that he was an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie to Chriſt his doctrine: and that he was more feruent in reſiſting the ſame then all the reſt, vntill hee was pulled backe by the hande of God: which thing hee ſayeth the chiefe Prieſt and Elders can teſtifie. Therefore there can bee no ſuſpition in ſuch a ſodaine change. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as hee ſaieth, that hee had letters giuen him to deliuer to the brethren, it muſt bee referred vnto the Iewes, as if hee had called them his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie men: but hee meant to appeaſe them with a more honourable tytle. For this is Paule his drifte, that hee may declare his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and lawefull beginnyng which hee tooke of that nation: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo howe deſirous hee was to bee linked with them in friendſhippe.</p>

                  <p n="6">
                     <hi>6</hi> And it happened that as I iourneyed and drewe neere to Damaſcus about noone, that ſodainely a greate light ſhone rounde ahout mee from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</p>
                  <p n="7">

                  <p n="8">

                     <hi>9</hi> And they which werewith me ſaw indeed the light, and were afraid, but they heard not the voyce of him which talked with me.</p>
                  <p n="10">
                     <hi>10</hi> Then I ſaide, what ſhall I doe Lorde? And the Lorde ſayde to mee, Ariſe, and goe to Damaſcus, and there it ſhall bee tolde thee, what thinges bee ordayned for thee to doe.</p>
                  <p n="11">
                     <hi>11</hi> And when I ſaw not by reaſon of the glory of the light, being led by the hand by thoſe companions which were with me, I came to Damaſcus.</p>
               </q>
               <p n="6">6 <hi>And it happened.</hi> Becauſe this hiſtorie was expounded more at large in the ninth Chapter, I will onely briefely touch thoſe thinges which were there ſpoken. But this is peculiar to this preſent place, that Paul reckoneth vp his circumſtances, that by them he may proue that hee was conuerted by God. And this is the thirde member of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon: otherwiſe this chaunge ſhoulde haue beene thought to haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded of inconſtancie, or raſhneſſe, or elſe it ſhoulde not haue beene voide of ſome infamie. For nothing is more intollerable than to ſtart aſide from the courſe of godlineſſe which men haue once entred: and alſo not to doe that which they are commaunded to doe. Therefore leaſt any man might ſuſpect Paul his conuerſion, hee proueth by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny myracles which hee bringeth to light, that God was the authour thereof. In the night ſeaſon there appeare oftentimes lightnings, which come of the hoate exhalations of the earth: but this was more ſtrange, that about noone a ſodayne light did not onely appeare, but did
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:7788:266"/> alſo compaſſe him about like a lightening, ſo that through feare thereof he fell from his horſe, and lay proſtrate vpon the ground. Another my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, in that he hard a voice fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heauen: another, in that his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panions heard it not as well as hee. Alſo there folow other things, that after that hee was ſent to Damaſcus the euent is correſpondent to the oracle: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Ananias commeth to meet him. Alſo in that his ſight is reſtored to him in a moment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I fell to the earth.</hi> As Paul was puffed vp with Phariſaical pride, it was meet that he ſhould be afflicted and throwen down, that he might hear Chriſt his voice. He would not haue deſpiced God openly, neither durſt he refuſe the heauenly oracle: yet his mind ſhould neuer haue been fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med vnto the obedience of faith, if he had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued in his former ſtate: therefore he is throwen down by violence, that hee may learn to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble himſelfe willingly. Furthermore, there is in Chriſte his woordes onelye a briefe reprehenſion, which ſerueth to appeaſe the rage of Paul beeing ſo cruelly bent. Neuertheleſſe wee haue thence an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent conſolation, in that Chriſte taking vppon him the perſon of all the Godlie, doth complaine that whatſoeuer iniurie was done to them, was done to him. And as there canne no ſweeter thing bee imagined to lenifie the bitterneſſe of perſecution, then when wee heare that the ſonne of God doth ſuffer not onelie with vs, but alſo in vs: ſo againe the bloudy enemies of the Goſpell, who being nowe beſotted with pride, do mocke the miſerable Church, ſhal perceiue whom they haue woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
               <p n="9">9 <hi>They which were with mee.</hi> I ſhewed in the other place that there is no ſuch diſagreement in the woordes of Luke, as there ſeemeth to bee. Luke ſaid there, that though Paul his companions ſtood amazed, yet heard they a voyce. But in this place he ſaith they heard not the voyce of him which ſpake to Paul, though they ſaw the light. Surely it is no abſurd thing to ſay that they heard ſome obſcure voice. Yet ſo that they did not diſcerne it as Paul himſelfe, whom alone Chriſt meant to ſtaye and taime with the reprehenſion. Therefore they heare a voyce, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a ſound doth enter into their eares, ſo that they knowe that ſome ſpeaketh from heauen, they heare not the voice of him that ſpake to Paul, becauſe they vnderſtand not what Chriſt ſaith. Moreouer they ſee Paul compaſſed about with the light, but they ſee none which ſpeaketh from heauen.</p>
               <p n="10">10 <hi>What ſhall I doe Lord?</hi> This is the voice of a tamed man, and this is the true turning vnto the Lord, when laying away all fearceneſſe and furie, wee bowe downe our neckes willingly to beare his yoke, and are readie to doe whatſoeuer he commaundeth vs. Moreover this is the beginning of well doing, to aske the mouth of God. For their labour is loſt who thinke vppon repentance without his worde. Furthermore in that Chriſt appointeth Ananias to bee Paule his maſter, hee doeth it not for any reproch, or becauſe he refuſeth to teach him: but by this meanes he meaneth to ſet forth and alſo to bewtifie the outward mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie of the Church.</p>
               <pb n="513" facs="tcp:7788:266"/>
               <p>And euen in the perſon of one man he teacheth vs that we muſt not grudge to heare him ſpeake with the tongue of men. To the ſame ende tendeth that which followeth immediatly, that he was blind, vntil offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring himſelfe to become a ſcholar, he had declared the humilitie of his faith. God doth not in deed make blind all thoſe whom he will lighten: but there is a general rule preſcribed to al men, that Thoſe became foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh with themſelues, who will be wiſe to him.</p>

               <p n="12">12 <hi>One Ananias.</hi> Paul proceedeth now vnto the fouerth point: to wit that he did not onely giue his name to Chriſt being aſtonyed with my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles: but that hee was alſo well and throughly inſtructed in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Goſpel. I haue already ſaide that Ananias met Paul not by chance, but through the direction of Chriſt. And whereas he giueth him the title of godlineſſe as concerning the Lawe, and ſaieth that hee was well reported off by the whole nation, in theſe words he preuenteth the wrong opinion which they might conceiue. As they loathed the Gentiles ſo they would neuer haue allowed any teacher comming from them. And one that had reuolted from the Law ſhould haue ben moſt deteſtable. Therefore he witneſſeth that he worſhipped God according to the Law, and that his godlines was knowne and commended among all the Iewes, ſo that they ought not to ſuſpect him. Theſe wordes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Law are ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly by ſome coupled with the text follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that he was approued according to the Law. For Ananias his reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is rather diſtinguiſhed by this marke from the ſuperſtitions of the Gentiles. Though we muſt note, that the Law is not mentioned to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the merits of works, that they may be ſet againſt the grace of God: but Ananias his godlineſſe is clearely acquited of al euil ſuſpition which might haue riſen among the Iewes. And ſeing that he reſtoreth ſight to Paul with one word: it appeareth thereby that he was ſent of God, as I haue ſaid before.</p>
               <p n="14">14 <hi>The God of our fathers.</hi> As nothing is more fit to prouoke vs ioyful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to goe forward towarde God, than when wee knowe that God doeth preuent vs with his free goodneſſe, that hee may call vs backe from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction to life: ſo Ananias beginneth heere. God ſaith he, hath ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thee to knowe his will: for by this meanes Paul is taught that God
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:7788:267"/> had reſpect vnto him at ſuch time as he went aſtray, and was altogither an enimie to his owne ſaluation: and ſo Gods predeſtination doth abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh all preparations which Sophiſters imagine, as if man did preuent Gods grace by his owne free will. In calling him the God of the Fathers, hee reneweth the rembrance of the promiſes, that the Iewes may know that the newe calling of Paul is ioyned with them: and that thoſe fall not away from the Lawe, who paſſeouer vnto Chriſt. Therefore Paul confirmeth that by theſe wordes which hee auouched before in his owne perſon, that hee had not made any departure from the God of Abraham, whome the Iewes had in times paſſed worſhipped: but that hee continueth in the auncient worſhippe which the Fathers did vſe, which hee had learned out of the Lawe. Wherefore when the queſtion is about religion, let vs learne by the example of Paule, not to imagine any newe God (as the Papiſtes and Mahometiſtes haue done, and as all heritikes vſe to doe) but let vs retaine that God who hath reuealed himſelfe in times paſt to the Fathers, both by the Lawe, and alſo by diuerſe Oracles. This is that antiquitie wherein wee muſt remaine, and not in that whereof the Papiſtes boaſt in vaine, who haue inuented to themſelues a ſtraunge God, ſeeing they haue forſaken the lawfull Fathers.</p>
               <p>The ſame is to bee ſaid at this day of the Iewes, whoſe religion ſeing it diſagreeth with the Lawe and the Prophets, their God muſt alſo bee degenerate and feigned. For hee who would in times paſt be called the God of Abraham and of the fathers, appeared at length in the perſon of his ſonne, that hee may nowe be called by his owne name or title the Father of Chriſt. Therefore he which reiecteth the ſonne, hath not the father, who cannot bee ſeperated from him. And Ananias ſaieth that it commeth to paſſe through the free Election of God, that the truth of the Goſpell doeth now appeare to Paule: whereuppon it followeth that he did not attaine vnto this by his owne induſtrie, which the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of the thing did alſo declare. For nothing was more ſtubberne than Paule, vntill Chriſt did tame him. And if wee deſire to knowe the cauſe and beginning, Ananias calleth vs backe vnto the counſell of God, whereby hee was appointed and ordained, and aſſuredlie it is a more precious thing to knowe the will of God, then that men can at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnto it by their owne induſtrie. That which Ananias affirmeth of Paul ought to bee tranſlated vnto all, that the treaſure of faith is not common to all: but it is offered peculiarly to the Elect. Furthermore it appeareth more plainly by the next member what this will of God is: for God ſpake at ſundrie times and many wayes by his Prophetes; but laſt of all hee reuealed and made knowne his will and himſelfe whollie in his ſonne.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To ſee the iust.</hi> Seeing all the Greeke bookes in a manner agree to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither in the Maſculine gender: I wonder why Eraſmus woulde rather tranſlate it in the Neuter, Which is Iuſt: which ſenſe the readers ſee to be colde and farre fet.<note place="margin">Heb. 1.1.</note> Therefore I doe not doubt but that Iuſt is taken in this place for Chriſt: and the text runneth very finely thus: becauſe
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:7788:267"/> it followeth immediatly after, &amp; Heare a voice from his mouth. And it is certaine that all the godly and holy men did moſt of all deſire that they might ſee Chriſt. Thence flowed that confeſſion of Simeon, Lord now letteſt thou thy ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t depart in peace: bicauſe mine eies haue ſeene thy ſaluation. Therfore this ſeing, which godly kings and prophets did moſt earneſtly deſire, as Chriſt himſelfe doeth witneſſe,<note place="margin">Luke. 2.29. Luk. 10.24.</note> is not without cauſe extolled as a ſingular benefite of God. But becauſe the ſight of the eyes ſhould profite little or nothing, which wee knowe was to manie deadly, hee adioyneth the hearing of the voice. Ananias ſetteth downe the cauſe why God did vouchſafe Paul of ſo great honour, to wit, that hee might be to his ſonne a publike witneſſe: and hee doth ſo prepare him, that he may learne not onely for himſelfe alone: but that he may haue ſo much the more care to profit, becauſe he ſhalbe the teacher of all the whole Church.</p>
               <p n="16">16 <hi>And now why tarriest thou?</hi> It is not to be doubted but that Ananias did faithfully inſtruct Paul in the principles of godlineſſe: for he would not haue baptized him if hee had beene voide of true faith. But Luke paſſeth ouer many things, and doth briefely gather the ſumme. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeing Paul doth vnderſtand that the promiſed redemption is nowe giuen in Chriſt: Ananias ſaieth for good cauſes that nothing ought to ſtay him from being Baptized. But when hee ſaieth, why tarrieſt thou? hee doeth not chide Paule, neither doeth hee accuſe him of ſlackeneſſe: but hee doeth rather amplifie the grace of God by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Baptiſme. The like ſentence had wee in the tenth Chapter,<note place="margin">Cha. 10.47.</note> Can any man let thoſe from being Baptized with water, who haue the holy Ghoſt giuen them euen as wee? But when hee ſaieth, Waſh away thy ſinnes: by this ſpeech hee expreſſeth the force and fruite of Baptiſme: as if hee had ſaide, Waſh away thy ſinnes by Baptiſme. But becauſe it may ſeeme that by this meanes more is attributed to the outwarde and corruptible element than is meete. The queſtion is whether Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme bee the cauſe of our purging. Surely for as much as the bloode of Chriſt is the onely meanes whereby our ſinnes are waſhed away: and as it was once ſhedde to this ende, ſo the holy Ghoſt by the ſprinkling thereof through faith doeth make vs cleane continually, this honour cannot be tranſlated vnto the ſigne of water, without doing open iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to Chriſt and the holy Ghoſt: and experience doeth teach howe earneſtly men be bent vnto this ſuperſtition. Therefore manie godly men, leaſt they put confidence in the outwarde ſigne, doe ouermuch extenuate the force of Baptiſme. But they muſte keepe a meaſure, that the Sacramentes may bee kept within their bounds, leaſt they darken the glorie of Chriſt: and yet they may not want their force and vſe. Wherefore wee muſt holde this, firſt that it is God alone who wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth vs from our ſinnes by the blood of his ſonne: and to the ende this waſhing may be effectuall in vs, he worketh by the hidden power of his Spirit. Therefore when the queſtion is concerning remiſſion of ſinnes, wee muſt ſeeke no other authour thereof, but the heauenlie Father:
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:7788:268"/> we muſt imagine no other materiall cauſe, but the blood of Chriſt, and whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we be com to the formal cauſe, the holy ghoſt is the chief: but ther is an inferiour inſtrument and that is the preaching of the word &amp; bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme it ſelf. But though God alone doth worke by the inward power of his Spirite, yet that doth not hinder, but that he may vſe at his pleaſure ſuch inſtruments and meanes as he knoweth to be conuenient, not that he includeth in the element any thing which he taketh either from his ſpirite or from the blood of Chriſt, but becauſe he will haue the ſigne it ſelfe to be an helpe for our infirmitie.</p>
               <p>Therefore foraſmuch as Baptiſme doth helpe our faith that it may reape forgiueneſſe of ſinnes by the blood of Chriſt alone, it is called the waſhing of the ſoule. So that the waſhing ſpoken of by Luke, doeth not note out the cauſe: but is referred vnto the vnderſtanding of Paul, who hauing receiued the ſigne, knew better that his ſinnes were done away. Though we muſt alſo note this, that there is no bare figure ſet before vs in Baptiſme, but that the giuing of the thing is therto annexed: becauſe God promiſeth nothing deceitfully, but doth indeed fulfill that whiche vnder the ſignes he doth ſignifie Notwithanding we muſt again beware that we tie not the grace of God to the ſacraments, for the external ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of baptiſme profiteth nothing, ſaue only where it pleaſeth God it ſhall. By this there is alſo an other queſtion aunſweared which may be moued. For ſeeing Paul had the teſtimonie of the grace of god, his ſinnes were alreadie forgiuen him. Therfore he was not waſhed on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie by baptiſme, but he receiued a new confirmation of the grace which he had gotten.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In calling vpon the name of the Lorde.</hi> It is out of queſtion that he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth Chriſt, not becauſe the name of Chriſt alone is called vpon in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſwe, but becauſe the father commandeth vs to aske of him whatſoeuer is figured in baptiſm: neither doth the operatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Spirit tend to any other end ſauing that it may make vs partakers of his death &amp; reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on: Therfore Chriſt is appointed to excell in baptiſm: yet in as much as he is giuen vs of the father, and in aſmuch as he powreth out his graces vppon vs by the holy Ghoſt. Whereby it commeth to paſſe that the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vppon the name of Chriſte, containeth both the Father and the Sonne.</p>
               <p>Wherefore Ananias doth not meane, that the name of Chriſte muſt only bee named: but hee ſpeaketh of prayer, whereby the faithfull doe teſtifie, that the effect of the outward ſigne is in the power of Chriſte alone. For the ſacraments haue neither anie power of ſaluation inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in them, neither are they any thing worth of themſelues. Wherfore this member is as it were a correction of the former ſaying, becauſe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanias doth in plaine words ſend Paul from repoſing confidence in the external ſigne, vnto Chriſt.</p>
               <p>It is well knowen howe much the Papiſtes differ from this rule, who tye the cauſe of grace to their exorciſmes and inchauntments: &amp; they are ſo farre from ſtudiyng to direct the miſerable people vnto Chriſt,
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:7788:268"/> that they rather drown Chriſt in Baptiſme, and pollute his ſacred name by their inchantments.</p>

               </q>
               <p n="17">17 <hi>And it came to paſſe.</hi> This had not bene the laſt concluſion, if Paul had not beene cut off with their outragious outcries. Notwithſtanding his drift and purpoſe doeth plainely appeare by the former text: for he beginneth to intreat of his miniſterie, that hee may ſhewe that hee departed not from the Iewes of his owne accorde, as if hee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drewe him of malice from taking paines with them: but he was drawne vnto the Gentiles contrary to his expectation and purpoſe. For he came purpoſely to Ieruſalem, that hee might impart with his owne nation that grace which was committed to him. But when the Lorde cutteth off his hope which hee had to doe good, hee driueth him thence. But there was a double offence which Paule goeth about to cure: for they both thought that the couenant of God was prophaned, if the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles ſhoulde bee admitted into the Church togither with them, and nothing did grieue the proude nation ſo much, as that other ſhoulde bee preferred before them, or ſo much as made equall with them. Therefore Paule his defenſe conſiſteth in this, that hee was readie, ſo much as in him laid, to doe them the beſt ſeruice he could: but he was afterward enforced by the commaundement of God to goe to the Gentiles, becauſe hee woulde not haue him to bee idle at Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem. Whereas Eraſmus tranſlateth it, That I was carried without my ſelfe, is in Greeke worde for worde, That I was in a traunce: whereby he meant to purchaſe credite to the Oracle. Alſo the circumſtance of the time and place doeth confirme the ſame, in that the Lorde appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to him as hee prayed in the Temple: which was an excellent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration to heare the voyce of God. Concerning the manner of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, reade that which wee touched about the ende of the ſeuenth Chapter.</p>
               <p n="18">18 <hi>Becauſe they will not.</hi> Though the commaundement of God alone ought to be ſufficient ynough to binde vs to obey: yet to the ende Paul
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:7788:269"/> might be the more willing to followe, Chriſt ſheweth him a reaſon why hee will haue him depart out of Ieruſalem: to wit, becauſe hee ſhoulde looſe his labour there: but he was not choſen to that end, that he might be idle, or doe no good by teaching: though this were a ſore triall, and ſuch as we may thinke did ſore ſhake him. Not long before the function of preaching the Goſpel was enioyned him, that his voice might ſound throughout the whole world: now euen at the firſt entrance he is inhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: yea his labour ſeemeth to be condemned of peculiar reproch, when his witneſſe is reiected, becauſe his perſon is hated. But it was meete that the holy ſeruant of the Lord ſhould bee thus humbled, that all the preachers of the Goſpell might learne to giue ouer themſelues whollie to obey Chriſt, that when they bee excluded from one place, they may be ready immediatly to go to another, and that they may not be diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged nor ceaſe off from doing their duetie though they be vndeſerued<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loathed.</p>
               <p n="19">19 <hi>Lord they know.</hi> By this ſpeech Paul doeth teſtifie that he was not beſide himſelfe or brought into perplexitie, but that hee did aſſuredlie beleeue the Oracle. For without doubt he knewe Chriſt whom he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth Lord. And Paul obiecteth, that it cannot almoſt be, but that when they ſee him ſo ſodainely chaunged, ſuch a ſpectacle will mooue them. Whence he gathereth that hee ſhall not be vnfruitfull. Hee thought ſo in deede: but Chriſt anſwereth flatly that he hath appointed him ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther charge: and hee taketh from him the hope which hee had in vaine conceiued touching the Iewes. The queſtion is whether it were lawfull for Paul, to obiect theſe reaſons to Chriſt: for it is as much as if he did auouch that that is probable, which Chriſt ſaide coulde not be. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, that God giueth his ſaintes leaue, familiarly to vtter their affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions before him: eſpecially when they ſeeke no other thing but the confirmation of their faith.</p>
               <p>If any man ſtand in his own conceit, or ſtubbernely refuſe that which God commaundeth, his arrogancie ſhall be worthily condemned: but God vouchſafeth his faithfull ſeruants of a ſingular priuilege, that they may modeſtly obiect thoſe things which may call them backe from the deſire to obey: to the end that being free from lets, they may wholly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict themſelues to ſerue God: as Paul, after that he was taught that it pleaſed the Lord that it ſhould be ſo, he doth not gaineſay nor contend any longer: but being content with that one exception, and making an end there, he maketh himſelfe ready to take his iorney, which he ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be loth to take. In the meane ſeaſon whereas the Iewes are not touched with ſo many myracles, their ſtubbernes and pride which can not be tamed, is diſcouered. Which vpbraiding did vndoubtedly cauſe them to rage.</p>
               <p n="22">22 <hi>Away with ſuch a fellowe.</hi> Luke ſheweth heere howe outragiouſlie Paul his ſermon was interrupted. For they doe not onely opppreſſe him with their crying, but they deſire to haue him put to death: where it doeth alſo plainelie appeare howe frenſie pride is. The Iewes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued ſo great good liking of themſelues, that they did not onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpice
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:7788:269"/> all the whole worlde in compariſon of themſelues, but they ſtoode alſo more ſtoutly in defenſe of their owne dignitye then of the Lawe it ſelfe: as if al religion did conſiſt in this, that Abraham his ſtocke might excell all other mortall men. So now they rage againſt and raile vpon Paul, becauſe hee ſaide that hee was ſent to bee the Apoſtle of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles: as if God were bounde by his owne liberalitie to ſuffer the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of his power in the wicked and vnthankfull, on whom he beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed excellent graces aboue all other. And it is no maruell if there were ſuche fierceneſſe and fury at that day among the Iewes, ſeeing that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by all meanes waſted, and accuſtomed to ſuffer extreme reproches at this daye, they ceaſe not notwithſtanding to ſwell with ſeruile pride.<note place="margin">Rom. 11.5.</note> But theſe be fruites of reprobation, vntil God gather together the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant according to Paul his prophecie.</p>

How can it be that thou beeing ſome baſe fellowe of the countrie of the Cilicians, ſhouldeſt obtayne this honour, for which I paid ſweetly? Whereas Paul maketh anſweare, that he was free borne, who neuer ſaw the citie, yea whoſe father it may be, was neuer there, there is no cauſe why this ſhould trouble any man. For thoſe who are skilfull in the Romaine hiſtorie, knowe that certayne were made free of the citie, who dwelt in the prouinces, if hauing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued well of the common wealth, or in warre, or in other waighty af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, they did deſire and craue this rewarde of the deputies: ſo that it is no abſurdity to ſay that he was borne a Citizen of Rome, who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending by his ancetors of ſome prouince farre diſtant from Rome, did neuer ſet foote in Italy. Notwithſtanding the queſtion is howe this can hang together, that the chiefe captaine was afraide, becauſe hee had bounde a Citizen of Rome, and yet he did not looſe him from his bondes vntill the morrowe. It may be that he deferred it till the next daye, leaſt he ſhoulde ſhew ſome token of feare. Notwithſtanding, I thinke that the chiefe captaine was afraide becauſe Paul was bounde at his commaundement, that he might be ſcourged, becauſe this was to do iniurie to the bodie of a Citizen of Rome, and to breake the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon liberty: and that it was lawfull to put a Romane in priſon.</p>

               </q>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>Looking earneſtly.</hi> Paul beginneth with the teſtimonie of a good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience: that al the whole multitude may vnderſtand, that he is vniuſtly charged with ſuch an hainous offence, as if he had gone about to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the woorſhippe of God. It may be indeed that a man may offend of ignorance, who will not otherwiſe be a contemner either of God or of religion: but Paul meant at the firſt only with this excuſe to mollifie their netled mindes, that he might the better be heard. For it had byn in vaine for him to haue defended himſelfe, ſo long as that opinion did ſticke in the mindes of the prieſts, that he was a wicked reuolt. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore before he enter the cauſe, hee excuſeth him ſelfe of that cryme:
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:7788:271" rendition="simple:additions"/> not onely that he may purchaſe fauour by that deſire which he had to liue godlily, but alſo that he may preuent falſe accuſations, or at leaſt that he may refute vniuſt preiudices which might haue made againſt him, wherewith he ſaw the whole multitude infected and corrupted. We know not what he meant to ſay beſides. Notwithſtanding this preface teacheth that no man can rightly handle the doctrine of godlines, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the feare of God reigne and beare the chief ſway in him. And now though hee giue not the prieſtes ſo honorable a title heere, as hee did a little before when he ſtood vppon the ſteppes of the fortreſſe: yet he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth them brethren, giuing them that honour: not becauſe they deſerue it, but that hee may teſtifie that hee is not the cauſe of the breache of friendſhip.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>And the chiefe prieſt.</hi> Luke his narration ſeemeth not to agree with the vſuall hiſtory. For Ioſephus writeth thus concerning the high prieſts of that time, that Quadratus deputie of Syria depoſing Cumanus from the gouernment of Iudea, commanded him to anſwere for himſelfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Caeſar, and ſent Ananias the higheſt prieſt bound with him, into whoſe place who was choſen he maketh no mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: ſauing that it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that Ionathas had the honour giuen him, who as he reporteth, was afterward ſlaine by the ſubtlety and trechery of Felix Deputie of Iudea, wh ſucceeded Cumanus. For when he had oftentimes told Felix part of his minde, and he coulde not away with the conſtancie of the man: he made a compact with one Doras, that hee ſhoulde priuily conuey in murtherers to ſlea him. Then, as the ſame Ioſephus doth witneſſe, King Agrippa made Iſmael the ſonne of Phebeus prieſt. But when he was ſent by the people to Rome about a certaine ſuite, and was kepte there by Popea wife to Nero, Agrippa putteth in his place one Ioſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus, whoſe name was Chabus, the ſonne of Simon. But immediatly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo weary of him, he appointeth Ananus the ſonne of Ananus to be high prieſt.</p>
               <p>Futhermore, he ſaith, that this laſt thing happened at ſuche time as after the death of Feſtus, Albinus did ſucceede him. And I ſee not why ſome call this Ananus Ananias. That hath indeed ſome colour, in that he is called a phariſie: alſo in that it is ſaid that he was bold and ſtout, who wythout any lawfull authoritie cauſed Iames the Lords brother to be ſtoned. But if we giue credaunce to Ioſephus, he coulde not bee that Ananias of whome mention is made in this place by Luke, who was then made prieſt, when manye yeeres were paſt and gone, after that Felix departed out of the prouince. I haue another coniecture in my head. For there flouriſhed during all that time one Ananias an high prieſte, who excepting the title of honour, was almoſt chiefe in the order. And becauſe Ioſephus leaueth ſome voyde time betweene Ananias and Iſmael, it may be that this manne had the roome of the higheſt prieſt in the meane time. But though this were not ſo, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth out of Ioſephus, that Ananias who died when the Citie was beſieged, was in the reigne of Claudius Caeſar and Nero equall in dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity with the chiefe prieſtes which were then.</p>
               <pb n="523" facs="tcp:7788:271"/>
               <p>Yea his authoritie is ſo highly extolled, as if he had had the chiefe go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement, howſoeuer other men did beare the inſignes of honour. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine hee is called <hi>archiereus</hi> confuſedly, as thoſe who were the higheſt Prieſts. Now let the readers ponder and conſider, whether the word <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiereus</hi> doth not rather ſignifie in this place Chiefe, than Higheſt, as it doth in many other places. For the Euangeliſts do euery where call the Prieſts who were of the Courſe of Aaron, <hi>archiereis,</hi> that they may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh them from the Leuites, who had a more inferiour degree of Prieſthoode. Moreouer it may bee that that Ananias who was coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſtout and couragious, did ſupplie the high Prieſts roome in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. Thoſe things which wee haue recited out of Ioſephus, are recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded partly in the twentieth booke of Antiquities, from the third Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, vntill the eight: partly in the ſeconde booke of the warres of the Iewes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He commanded him to be ſmiten.</hi> We ſee that there was in this aſſembly great diſtemperature. For whereas the high Prieſt was in ſuch rage that hee commaunded Paule to bee ſmiten for nothing, hee did it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly with the conſent of all the reſt: yea to the ende hee might winne the fauour of madde men. The Lorde doeth ſuffer the wicked to be ſo carried away by Sathan, that they fall from all ſhew of equitie and temperance. For hypocrites woulde faine beare ſome ſhewe of mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: and vndoubtedly this high Prieſt went about to pretende ſuch grauitie as did beſeeme his perſon. But the Lord did plucke this viſure from his face, ſo that there was not founde in him ſo much as the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtie of a meane man, but hee powred out his furious force like a beaſt.</p>
               <p>In the meane ſeaſon wee ſee what horrible and filthy diſorder there was at that day in the Church. Ananias, who was the chiefe of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, whereas he ought to haue ſtayed others by his grauitie: forgetting all modeſtie, he enforceth them vnto violence and ſauageneſſe. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had at that day no regarde of diſcipline: but there remained among them confuſed barbariſme. And no maruell for they had eſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged themſelues from God: they had moſt reprochfully reiected Chriſt: all their religion was ſet to ſale: therefore it was meete that they ſhould runne headlong into furious madnes, which might bee loathſome euen among prophane men, that they might be puniſhed in their own ſhame, for their vngodlineſſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>God ſhall ſmite thee.</hi> Paul cannot put vp that iniurie, but hee muſt at leaſt with ſharpe wordes reprehende the high Prieſt, and denounce Gods vengeance vnto him. For it is no curſſe as appeareth ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently by the Greeke text: but rather a reprehenſion, ioyned with the denouncing of a puniſhment. If any man obiect, that Paule did not vſe that modeſtie, which Chriſt commaundeth his to vſe, when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth them after they haue receiued a blowe on the left cheeke to turne the right cheeke alſo: we may readily anſwere,<note place="margin">Mat. 5.39.</note> that Chriſt doth not in theſe wordes require ſilence, whereby the wickedneſſe and fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſſe of the wicked may bee nouriſhed: but he doeth onely bridle
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:7788:272" rendition="simple:additions"/> their mindes, that they may not take that iniury which they haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie receiued, impaciently. Chriſt will haue thoſe that be his to bee readie to ſuffer another iniury, after that they haue already receiued one: and by this meanes hee repreſſeth all deſire of reuenge. This is a briefe and true definition of patience which beſeemeth all the faithfull, that they breake not out into wrathfulneſſe, that they doe not one euill turne for another: but that they ouercome euill with goodneſſe. But this is no let but that they may complaine of thoſe iniuries which they haue ſuffered, but that they may reproue the wicked, and cite them to the iudgement ſeat of God: ſo they do this with quiet and calme minds: and ſecondly without euill will and hatred: as Paule appealeth in this place vnto gods iudgment ſeat, that the high prieſt may not flatter him ſelfe in his tyranny. Therefore he accuſeth him, becauſe hee breaketh the Law, from which (as he pretendeth) he hath his authoritie: whence he gathereth, that he ſhall not eſcape vnpuniſhed. If any man being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome with impatience, doe but murmure, he ſhal not be blameleſſe: But a manifeſt and ſharpe accuſation, if it proceed from a quiet minde, doth not paſſe the bounds ſet downe by Chriſt. If any man ſay, that it is mixed with railing. I anſwere, that we muſt alwayes marke with what af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection the words be vttered. Chriſt pronounceth that man to bee wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie to be puniſhed by the councel, who ſhall only ſay to his brother, Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha:<note place="margin">Mat. 5.22.</note> and as for him who ſhall ſay, thou foole, hee maketh him ſubiect to a more heauie iudgement. But if opportunitie be offered to reproue, we muſt oftentimes reprehend ſharply. Wherby it appeareth, that this on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was Chriſt his drift, to keep back his, firſt from al indignation, ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from ſpeaking any thing in deſpite of any man. Therefore let vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of railing, and then we may not only note in our brethren fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhneſſe, but alſo it ſhall bee I we full for vs to expreſſe their offences by their names when need ſhall bee. So Paul did not ſpeake for his owne ſake, that he might with ſharpe words requite the iniury done to him by the high prieſt: but bicauſe he was a miniſter of the word of god, he wold not wink at an offence which did deſerue ſharp &amp; ſerious reprehenſion: eſpecially ſeeing it was profitable to bring to light the groſſe hypocriſie of Ananias. Therfore ſo often as we haue any dealings with the wicked, if we be deſirous to handle a good cauſe well, we muſt beware that there breake out in vs no motion of anger, that no deſire of reuenge prouoke vs to breake out into railing. But if the ſpirit of meeknes raigne in vs; we may handle the wicked according to their deſerts, as it were out of the mouth of God: yet ſo that it may appeare that wee bee rather prophets, then that we blunder out any thing raſhly through immoderate heat.</p>
               <p n="4">4 <hi>Thoſe which ſtood by ſaid.</hi> By this it appeareth that they were al ſicke of one diſeaſe. For why do they not rather blame Ananias, when they ſaw that he had quite forgotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al modeſty, &amp; that he brake out into vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and ſtripes after a barbarous manner; for euen this did turne to the reproch of them all. But this is a ſolemne thing among hypocrites, they looke narrowly into other mens faultes, and winke at their owne. Againe, this pride is coupled with tyranny, ſo that their ſubiectes and
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:7788:272"/> thoſe who are vnder them may doe nothing, but as for themſelues they may do whatſoeuer they wil. So fareth it at this day in popery, the more liberty that impure cleargie doth graunt to it ſelfe, and the more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſlie it waxeth wanton, and polluteth the whole world with the ſinnes which flow thence, the more ſtraitly doe they rule, and ſtay the tongues of the people. Therefore if any man dare be ſo bold as once to whiſper: a little liberty doth cauſe them to make outragious outcries as if it wer haynous ſacriledge.</p>
               <p n="5">5 <hi>I knew not brethren.</hi> Thoſe who thinke that this excuſe of Paul hath in it no figure, doe not well marke the contrarie obiections wherewith their errour is refuted. They ſay that Paul knew not the high prieſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had bin abſent long time. As if he were ignoraunt, that he was chiefe prieſt, who is the chiefe in the counſel, and hath the vppermoſt roome. Neither was Ananias ſo baſe and obſcure, that Paul was ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of his degree. But his wordes cut off all occaſion of diſputation, when as he chideth him, becauſe occupying the place of a iudge vnder colour of the lawe, he doth in his rage that which is contrary to law. Therfore Paul knew what place he had, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſaid that he abuſed his power. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therſome inuent a more ſubtil anſwere, that he ſpake not here of the man, but of the office and publike perſon. But firſt the expoſition is farre fet, becauſe if Paul did reuerence the prieſthood, he muſt needs haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſome honour to the man which had the ſame. And now it is not to be thought (foraſmuch as the maieſty of the prieſthood was aboliſhed by the comming of Chriſt, &amp; that there folowed ſuch filthy profanatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,) that Paul did honor thoſe as he was woont (as if their perfect &amp; lawfull authority did continue) who vnder the title of the high prieſts did reign as Lords without any law or right. Therfore ſubſcribing to Auguſtine, I doe not doubt but that this is a tanting excuſe. Neither doth that anye whit hinder becauſe plain ſpeech beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth the miniſters of the word. For ſeeing there be 2. ſorts of Ironiaes, one which is couered, with ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tletie &amp; meanes to deceiue, another which doth ſo figuratiuely note out the thing which is in hand, that it doth prick ſorer: in this ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d there is nothing which doth not wel beſeem the ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of Chriſt. Therfore this is the meaning of the words, Brethren, I acknowledge nothing in this man, which belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geth to the prieſt. Alſo he addeth a teſtimony of the 22. chap. of Exod.<note place="margin">Exo. 22.28.</note> in which place though Moſes ſpeak of iudges, yet the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is extended properly vnto any lawful order. Therefore all dignity which is appointed for maintenance of ciuil gouernment, ought to bee reuerenced &amp; had in honor. For whoſoeuer he be that rebelleth againſt or reſiſteth the magiſtrate &amp; thoſe who are appointed to rule, and are promoted vnto honor, he wold haue no gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. And ſuch deſire te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to the diſturbing of order. Yea it ſhaketh and ouerthroweth all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity. Therfore Paul purgeth himſelf of this crime: yet ſo, that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth that Ananias is to be counted a prieſt of God, who hath corrupted &amp; peruerted al the order of the church. But here riſeth a queſtion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we ought not to obey a ruler, though he exerciſe tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ny. For if that ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be not to be depriued of honor, which executeth his office amiſſe,
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:7788:273"/> Paul offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded in robbing the high prieſt of his honor. Therfore I anſwere that there is ſome difference betweene ciuil magiſtrates, &amp; the prelates of the church. For thogh the exployting of earthly or ciuil rule be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed or peruerſe: yet the Lord wil haue men to continue ſtil in ſubiection. But when the ſpiritual gouernment doth degenerate, the conſciences of the godly are at libertye, and ſet free from obeying vniuſt authoritie: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially if the wicked and prophane enimies of holines doe falſly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the title of prieſthood to ouerthrow the doctrine of ſaluation, and challenge to themſelues ſuch authoritie, as that they will be thereby e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual with God. So it is not only lawful for the faithfull at this daye to ſhake off from their ſhoulders the popes yoke, but they muſt do it of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity: ſeeing they cannot obey his lawes, vnleſſe they forſake God,

               </p>
               <p n="6">6 <hi>And when Paul knewe.</hi> The pollicie of Paule whereof Luke maketh mention, doeth ſeeme not to beſeeme the ſeruant of Chriſt. For the ſubtilty which he vſed, was inwrapped in diſſimulation, which was not farre from a lye. He ſaith that the ſtate of his cauſe did conſiſt in the reſurrection of the dead. But wee knowe that the ſtrife aroſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout other matters. Becauſe hee diſanulled the ceremonies, becauſe hee admitted the Gentiles into the couenaunt of ſaluation. I aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweare, that, though theſe thinges be true, yet did not he lye. For he doth neyther denie that hee was accuſed of other matters, neither doth this make the whole controuerſie to conſiſt in one point: but hee ſaith truely that the Sadduces were therefore offended with hym, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he did holde the reſurrection of the dead. He knewe that thoſe who had conſpyred together agaynſt him, were enemies alſo one to another. Hee knewe that his owne conſcience was cleere: and it had beene an eaſie matter for him to prooue his cauſe good before iuſt iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. Yet becauſe he ſeeth them crie out on him clamorouſly, and that he had no place graunted to defend himſelfe, he ſetteth his enemies together by the eares. Whereby it doeth alſo appeare, that they were carried away through ignoraunce and blinde zeale. Therefore we muſt note that Paul did ſo beginne, as that he was deſirous truelie and plainly to vnfold the whole matter: and that he did not craftily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to make a pure and ſounde confeſſion, ſuch as the ſeruauntes of
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:7788:273"/> Chriſt ought to make: but becauſe the way was ſtopt before him, neither could he be heard, he vſed the laſt remedie, to declare that his aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries were carried headlong with blinde hatred. For the end doth ſhew, that thoſe are not guided with reaſon or iudgement, who are carried out of the waie by mutuall diſcord. Now if any man which darkneth the light of doctrine, excuſe his craft, by the example of Paul, he is eaſily refuted. For it is one thing for a man to prouide for him ſelfe alone with the loſſe of trueth: and another, to leade the profeſſed enemies of Chriſt from reſiſting him, that they may ſtriue among themſelues.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, we ſee the nature of the wicked, though they diſagree among them ſelues like enemies, yet when they are to make warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Goſpel, they forget their owne garboiles. For Satan the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of diſcorde, doth procure this one conſent only among his, that they may bee of one minde and of one affection, to extinguiſh godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. So we ſee that the factions which are in popery whot, are quiet only ſo long as they ioine hand in hand to oppreſſe the Goſpell. For which cauſe the diſciples of Chriſt muſt be more couragious to foſter &amp; nouriſh trueth, that being ioyned together, they may the better reſiſt. Alſo we gather by this what manner of peace the Scripture commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vnto vs. Chriſt ſaith that the peace makers are the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God, &amp; this is true, that they muſt do what they can,<note place="margin">Mat. 5.9.</note> to bring all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that they may grow together vnder the Lord. Yet this doth not hinder, but that we may (fighting vnder the banner of the ſame Lorde) as it were with the ſound of the trumpet ſtirre vp the wicked, that they may like Madi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anites one ſlea another: ſo that both ſimplicity of zeale,<note place="margin">Iud. 7.22.</note> &amp; the wiſedom of the ſpirit direct vs hither.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>One part were Sadduces.</hi> We ſee here again as in a glaſſe, how deformed and confuſed the ruine of the Church was at that day. Faith is the ſoule of the Church: nothing is more proper to faith then agreement, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more contrary then ſects. And this thing muſt needes followe, when euery man (ſetting aſide the worde of God) did draw his diſciples vnto his owne inuentions. For there is no other holy bond of vnity, then the naturall and plaine truth of God. So ſone as men depart from that, no maruell if they bee deſpearſed, and drawne hither and thither like members pulled a ſunder.</p>
               <p>Therfore the beginning of ſects among the Iewes was the corruption of the law: like as the Lord did reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge the profanatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his word, which was corrupt with diuers inuentions of men with like puniſhment in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery. Wherfore we muſt the more fear, leaſt horrible, &amp; more lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſcatterings hang ouer our heads, then was that which was in time of popery: whereof there appeare ſome tokens. And no maruell ſeeing we prouoke the Lord to wrath ſo many wayes with our vnthankefulneſſe. But though the face of the church be blotted and blurred with manie ſpottes and blottes: and what manner of deformitie ſoeuer fall out heereafter, let vs comfort our ſelues with this: that, as God was care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full then to deliuer the church wonderfully from deſtruction, ſo tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row his grace there ſhall alwayes ſome ſeede continue. It cannot bee
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:7788:274"/> in deede but that godly mindes will ſomewhat deſpaire, when they ſee thinges ſo farre out of order: but let vs learne ſtreightway to holde vp that buckler, that the Lorde who in ſuch a thick miſt of errours, in ſuch an heape of ſuperſtitions, in the vnbridled licenciouſnes of ſectes, did preſerue his Church among the Iewes, will neuer ſuffer the ſame to bee quite put out wholly in the world. The ſame thing did likewiſe happen in poperie. For when as the worſhip of God was ouerthrowne there, the doctrin of ſaluation was oppreſſed, the kingdome of Chriſt was thrown downe, and vngodlineſſe did openly reigne: yet God did ſaue certaine hidden remnants, and there was alwaies ſome wheat in the chaffe. It is very profitable to conferre theſe examples togither. When as wee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueigh at this day againſt popery, the hyred patrons thereof crie out on the otherſide, that nothing is more abſurd, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that we ſhould imagine that the Church of God was extinguiſhed during many ages: as if wee did imagine that God had no people left, when thoſe had forſaken him who ought to haue maintained his pure worſhippe. Yea we complaine that thoſe tyrants did corrupt the church, that the temple was by them profaned, ſo that it did not greatly differ from an hogſtie, that the flock of Chriſt was ſcattered abroad, and his ſheepfold broken downe. Finally that the church was hidden from the eyes of men, yet ſo that the Lorde knew his elect, though they were diſpearſed, and did browd them vnder his wings. And by this it appeareth how fooliſhly the Papiſts brag and boaſt of the titles of honour, in that not the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon ſort, or any priuate men, but the prieſtes them ſelues did in times paſt diuide the Iewiſhe church by deadly diſſention.</p>
               <p>Wherefore there is no cauſe why we ſhould be afraid ſtoutly to reſiſt the pride of the Pope and of all his adherents, with whom we haue the ſame cumbate, which the prophetes and apoſtles had with the prieſtes of their time. And as the reuerence of the church did not keep back ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie men, but that they did moleſt the tyranny of the wicked prieſtes, ſo we muſt not be terrified with vaine viſures, vnder which the Papiſts doe vainly boaſt: ſeeing they haue notwithſtanding caſt from them the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of godlines. It is certaine, that the people were then diuided into three ſects: but Luke doth only make mention of the phariſies and Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces, omitting the Eſſenes: becauſe it was moſt fit for his purpoſe thus to do. And though this be the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon opinion concerning their names, that the former took their name of ſeparating, becauſe they withdrew themſelues from the company of other men, by reaſon of their feigned holines: and that the ſecond ſort took their name of righteouſnes, as if they were called Zeduchim: notwithſtanding for mine owne part as I haue ſaid elſwhere, I am rather of their mind, who ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y that the phariſies took their name of interpreting. For <hi>Phrus</hi> ſignifieth expoſition: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon alſo interpreters are called <hi>phruſchim:</hi> &amp; we know that the phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies being not content with the natural doctrine of the law &amp; prophets, did put in many inuentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, which they ſaid they receiued of the fathers.</p>
               <p n="8">8 <hi>The Sadduces ſay.</hi> Though Luke maketh mention of 3. points where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in theſe ſects did diſſent: yet ſhortly after he bringeth them to 2. becauſe
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:7788:274"/> there is like reſpect to be had of ſpirits &amp; of Angels. Therefore he ſaith that the Phariſees did confeſſe both: to wit, that the dead ſhall riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and that humane and angelicall ſpirites are immortall. And here Luke declareth in what ſenſe the Apoſtle profeſſed himſelfe to bee a Phariſee: not becauſe he did ſubſcribe to all their inuentions, but only in the reſurrection of the dead. We know howe ſharply Chriſte reproueth their errours, therefore it had been good that ſome exception had byn added, leaſt any man might thinke that Paul was one with them in all thinges. Now though the Saduces did denie the reſurrection, yet may we not thinke that they were altogether like to the Epicures.<note place="margin">Mat. 22.29.</note> For they did confeſſe that the world is gouerned by the prouidence of God, and that euery man is rewarded for his workes. In this point they wer ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der then the Epicures. But they did dote too groſly, when they included the rewards of righteouſneſſe, &amp; the puniſhments of wickednes in this life. For that I may omit the ſcripture, experience doeth teach, that as well the godlie as the vngodly are either puniſhed with many miſeries, or els gently dealt withall: and that the wicked doe oftentimes liue in wealth and pleaſures, when as the worſhippers of God are oftentimes miſerably tormented, as it is Pſalm. 73.<note place="margin">Pſal. 73.4.</note> Therefore whoſoeuer eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the iudgement of God by the preſent eſtate of men, whether it be good or bad, hee muſt needes fall away from faith at length vnto Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curiſh contempt of God.</p>
               <p>Now this is beaſtly blockiſhneſſe to reſt in an vncertain &amp; tranſito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie life, and not to be wiſe aboue the earth. For which cauſe we muſt flee fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that error as from a deteſtable monſter. For though godlines haue the promiſes of the earthly life alſo: yet becauſe we be moſt miſerable if our hope ſtay ſtill in this worlde, the children of God muſt begin with this, that they may lift vp their eyes toward heauen, and think continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally vpon the glory of the laſt reſurrection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Neither angell nor ſpirite.</hi> This place is expounded two manner of wayes. Many referre it vnto the holy Ghoſt: which ſeemeth to bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely. For howſoeuer the Saduces be to be holden excuſed in other er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours: yet becauſe the ſcripture doeth ſo often repeate the name of the Spirite, I will ſcarce beleeue that they denyed that which the Phariſes beleeued onely lightly and obſcurely. For euen theſe men had no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct faith concerning the holy Spirite, that they did acknowledge the proper perſon of the Spirit in the ſubſtance of God. Some wil haue An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel and Spirite to ſignifie one thing, as if one thing were ſpoken twiſe. But to what ende was it to repeate a thing which was plaine enough? I warraunt you that member which followeth did deceiue them, where Luke ſeemeth to make no diſtinction. But we ſhewed the reaſon before: becauſe ſeeing the ſoules of men and Angels are of one and the ſame nature and ſubſtance, they be both placed in one order. Therefore I do not doubt but that this is Luke his true meaning that the Saduces did denie Angels, and alſo all maner of Spirites.</p>
               <p>Nowe for as much as Paul crieth that hee is a Phariſee in this point of doctrine, hee doeth flatly condemne all brainſicke fellowes
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:7788:275"/> who at this day are in the ſame error. For there be certaine profane &amp; vnlearned men who dreame that Angelles and Diuels are nothing els but good and euil inſpirations: and leaſt they want ſom colour, they ſay that all that came from the Heathen, which the ſcripture hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning good and euill angels: whereas that opinion which was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in the world had his beginning from the heauenly doctrine. But the Heathen did with their lyes pollute that doctrine which they had from the fathers. As touching mens ſoules, becauſe euen at this day, certain miſcreants doe feigne that the ſoules do vaniſh away in death vntill the day of the reſurrection, their madneſſe is likewiſe refuted by the teſtimony of Luke.</p>
               <p n="9">9 <hi>There was a great crie.</hi> That ſedition whereof Luke ſpake a little before, is more plainly expreſſed in this place: to wit, that they were not only of diuers opinions, but did ſtriue clamorouſly with outcries. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>ſtaſis</hi> doth ſignifie ſomewhat more then diſſention. Furthermore this place doth teach what miſchief diſagreementes bring with them. For becauſe they take their beginning for the moſte part of ambition, men proceed thence vnto contention, and ſtraightway ſtubbornneſſe breaketh out. When they be come thither: becauſe there is no place left either for iudgement or moderation, they can no longer iudge of the cauſe. Thoſe who did deteſt Paul, begin at a ſodaine to defend him. It was well done, if they had done it with iudgement. But becauſe they inueigh againſt the Sadduces, they are ſo inflamed with hatred againſt them, that they be blind in Paul his matter. For which cauſe we muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of heat of contention, which diſturbeth all things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If the ſpirit.</hi> This ought vndoubtedly to be expounded of the holie Ghoſt. And nothing could be ſpoken either more godlily or modeſtly. For ſo ſoone as it is apparant that any doctrine is reuealed from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, thoſe doe wickedly reſiſt God, who doe not receiue the ſame. But how is it that the Scribes do ſo ſodainly count Paul a prophete of God, whom they were once readie to haue murthered: whom they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned with their preiudice, vntill the contention aroſe? Furthermore as they did cut their owne throtes with theſe words as with a ſwoord: ſo God would haue them to be to vs teachers to inſtruct vs that we deſpice not the oracles which come from heauen. Notwithſtanding wee ſee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, that thoſe ſtande in doubt, who take not good heede and are not carefull to marke the woord of God: and that they wauer ſo often as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie thing is brought to light, becauſe they be vnworthie to vnderſtande the certaine truth. Wherefore if wee bee deſirous to haue our ſtudies gouerned by the ſpirite of diſcretion, let vs applie our ſelues to learne.</p>

               <p n="11">11 <hi>And the night following,</hi> Luke declareth that Paul was ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened with an oracle, that he might ſtand couragiouſly againſt terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble aſſaultes, when things were ſo far out of order. Surely it could not be but that he was ſore afraid, and that hee was ſore troubled with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance of things to come. Wherfore the oracle was not ſuperfluous. Thoſe former things, whereby he was taught that God cared for him, ought to haue ſufficed to nouriſh his hope, and to haue kept hym from fainting: but becauſe in great dangers, Satan doth oftentimes procure new feares, that he may thereby (if he cannot altogether ouerwhelme Gods promiſes in the hearts of the godly) at leaſt darken the ſame with cloudes: it is needfull that the remembrance of them bee renued, that faith beeing holpen with new proppes and ſtayes, may ſtand more ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly. But the ſumme is, that Paul may behaue him ſelfe boldly, becauſe hee muſt bee Chriſte his witneſſe at Rome alſo. But this ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to bee but a colde and vaine conſolation: as if he ſhoulde ſay: Feare not, becauſe thou muſt abide a ſorer brunt: for it had beene bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter accordyng to the fleſhe, once to die and with ſpeede to ende his dayes, then to pine awaye in bandes and long time to lie in priſon.
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:7788:276"/> The Lord doth not promiſe to deliuer him, no he ſaith not ſo muche as that he ſhall haue a ioyfull end: only he ſaith that thoſe troubles and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions wherewith hee was too ſore oppreſſed alreadie, ſhall continue long. But by this we gather better of what great importance this confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is, that the Lord hath reſpect vnto vs in our miſeries, though hee ſtretch not foorth his hand by and by to helpe vs. Therefore let vs learn euen in moſt extreeme afflictions to ſtay our ſelues vppon the woord of God alone: and let vs neuer faint ſo long as hee quickneth vs with the teſtimonie of his fatherly loue. And becauſe Oracles are not nowe ſent from heauen, neither doeth the Lorde himſelfe appeare by viſions, wee muſt meditate vpon his innumerable promiſes, whereby he doth teſtifie that he will be nigh vnto vs continually. If it be expedient that an angel come downe vnto vs, the Lord will not denie euen this kinde of confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. Neuertheleſſe we muſt giue this honour to the word, that being content with it alone, wee wait patiently for that helpe which it promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth vs.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, it did profite ſome nothing to heare Angeles which were ſent downe from heauen: but the Lord doth not in vaine ſeale vp in the hearts of the faithfull by his Spirite thoſe promiſes which are made by him. And as he doth not in vaine beate them in and often repeat them, ſo let our faith exerciſe it ſelfe diligentlye in the continuall remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of them.

               <p n="12">12 <hi>And when it was day.</hi> By this circumſtaunce Luke ſheweth howe neceſſary it was for Paul to gather new and freſh ſtrength of faith, that he might nor quake in moſt great and ſodaine danger. For being told of this ſo deſperate madneſſe of his enemies, he could not otherwiſe think but that he ſhould looſe his life. This vow whereof Luke ſpeaketh, was a kinde of curſe. The cauſe of the vow was, that it might not be lawful for them to change their purpoſe, nor to cal back that which they had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed. There is alwaies in deed in an oath a ſecret curſe, if any man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue or forſweare: but ſometimes to the end men may the more bind themſelues, they vſe certaine formes of curſing: and they make them<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelues ſubiect to cruell torments, to the ende they may be thee more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid. This hiſtorie doeth teache that zeale is ſo blooddy in hypocrites, that they weigh not what is lawfull for them: but they runne careleſly whither ſoeuer their luſt doth carry them. Admit we graunt that Paul was a wicked man, and worthie to die: yet who had giuen priuate men leaue to put him to death?

Moreouer we ſee in this hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie how great the raſhneſſe of the wicked is. They bind themſelues with a curſe, that they will eat no meat till they haue ſlaine Paul: as if his life were in their hands. Therefore theſe brainſick men take to them ſelues that which the Lord doth ſo often in Scripture ſay is his, to wit,<note place="margin">Deut. 32.39</note> to haue the life and death of thoſe men whom hee hath created in his hande. Moreouer there bee not onely two or three who are partners in this madneſſe, but more then fortie.

               <p>Furthermore, ſeeing Satan doeth driue them headlong into their own deſtruction: how ſhamefull is then our ſluggiſhneſſe, when as wee ſcarce moue one finger in maintaining the glory of God? Wee muſt vſe moderation, that wee attempt nothing without the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God: but when God calleth vs expreſly, our loitring is without excuſe.</p>
               <p n="14">14 <hi>They came to the chiefe prieſtes.</hi> Seeing that the prieſts agree to ſuch a wicked and vngodly conſpiracie, by this they proue that there was in them neither any feare of God, neither yet any humanitie. They doe not only allowe that which is brought before them concerning the murthering of the man by laying awaite: but alſo they are readie to be partners in the murder, that they may deliuer him into the handes of the murtherers, whom they woulde haue made away ſome way, they paſſe not howe. For what other thing was it to take a man out of the handes of the iudge and to ſlea him, then like murtherers to rage euen in the very place of iudgement? The prieſts ſurely would neuer haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed ſuche a wicked purpoſe if there had been in them any droppe of godly and right affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or of humane feeling.

               <p n="16">16 <hi>Paul his ſiſters ſonne.</hi> Wee ſee in this place how the Lord doth croſſe the purpoſes of the vngodlye.

               <p n="17">17 <hi>Calling vnto him.</hi> Paul was not ſo deſirous of life, but he would haue made haſt to die, if the Lord had thought it good ſo to bee: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he knoweth that he ſerueth Chriſt vppon that condition, that he may no leſſe liue then die to him, he doth not neglect to auoid the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger which was reuealed to him. And though he be fully perſuaded that God is the keeper of his life: yet hee doeth not wait vntill God put foorth his hand out of heauen to worke a myracle, but doth rather vſe the remedy which is offered him: nothing douting but that it is appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God.</p>
               <p>Thus muſt all the miniſters of Chriſt deale, that being furniſhed with
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:7788:277" rendition="simple:additions"/> inuincible conſtancie, ſo farre as their calling requireth, they feare not danger, and yet that they caſt not away themſelues through raſhneſſe. Let them call vpon the name of the Lorde, cheerefully euen amidſt the pikes: and yet let them not contemne thoſe helpes which are offered. Otherwiſe they ſhall be iniurious to God, in that they are not only not moued with his promiſes, but alſo deſpice the means which he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for their deliuerance.</p>
               <p n="19">19 <hi>Taking him by the hand.</hi> In that the chiefe captaine did ſhewe himſelf ſo courteous to the young man, in that he lead him by the hand into a ſecret place, in that he vouchſafed to heare him ſo gently, all this muſt be attributed to the grace of God, who promiſed to giue his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple fauour in the ſight of the Egyptians, who vſeth to mollifie harde hearts, to tame fierce ſpirites, and to faſhion thoſe vnto al humanitie, whom he hath determined to vſe as meanes to helpe thoſe that be his. A man trained vp in the warres might no leſſe haue giuen this young man the repulſe, whom he knew not, then haue deſpiced Paul his ſute. Therefore the Lord who hath in his hand the hearts of men, did frame the profane man to giue eare vnto him. Alſo it was well that he knewe before how furiouſly they raged againſt Paul, that hee might the more willingly ſuccour a miſerable and forſaken man. Thoſe who are in authoritie are taught by this example what a great vertue curteſie is. If it had bin an hard matter to come to him, he might through ignorance haue deliuered Paul to the Iewes to bee put to death. So often times Magiſtrates doe fall into many and great offences through their owne pride, becauſe they will not admit thoſe who woulde giue them good counſell.</p>

For though this bee the drift of the chiefe captaine, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent a publike vprore, whereof he ſhould haue giuen an account before the Gouernour: yet hee executeth the counſell of God in deliuering Paul. For he was to gather ſouldiars together: alſo the citie muſt needs be ſtripped of the garriſon, and the voyage required ſome coſt. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt ſo conſider the wiſedome of the chiefe captaine, that our faith lift vp her eyes into heauen, and vnderſtand that God doth guide the heart of a profane man by a ſecret inſtinct, and that hee is at length a guide to Paul and the ſouldiars, that hee may come ſafe to Ceſarea. The third houre of the night was the end of the firſt watch. Therefore it is all one as if the chiefe captaine did commaunde that the ſouldiars be in readineſſe at the ſecond watch.<note place="margin">Exod. 3.21.</note> Luke calleth thoſe who carried dartes <hi>Lancearios,</hi> who being more lightly weaponed, were placed in the winges, when as the ſouldiars which pertained vnto the legions were more fit for ſet warre.</p>

               </q>
               <p n="25">25 <hi>And he wrote a letter.</hi> Firſt, we muſt briefly admoniſh the Readers, who haue not bin conuerſant in hiſtories, that this Foelix was brother to Pallas, who being Caeſars freema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, became equal with the chief of the citie in welth and power. Yea moreouer the Senate gaue him the orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Pretor not without titles of filthie and ſhamefull flattery. Therfore ſeeing the ſeruaunts of Claudius abuſing his folly did rule the Romane Empire at their pleaſure, and chiefly Narciſſus and Pallas, no maruel if this latter did appoint his brother to be gouernour of Iudea. The ſumme of the Epiſtle tendeth to this end, that the chiefe captaine may helpe Paul with his preiudice: and may admoniſhe Foelix of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuries of his aduerſaries, and may ſo diſcredite them that they may not be able to do him any hurt.</p>
               <p n="27">27 <hi>This man being taken.</hi> This was ſpoken odiouſly concerning the Iewes that he might purchaſe more fauour for Paul, that a man being a Romane was by them ſore beaten and almoſt ſlaine: alſo hee commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth him for the right and priuiledge of his freedome, that he may bee the more courteouſly handled. Furthermore this commendation was not purchaſed by prayer or flatterie, neither was it bought with money. How came it to paſſe then that the chiefe captaine did ſhew himſelfe ſo courteous freely to an obſcure man &amp; whom al men did hate, ſaue only becauſe the Lord had appointed him to be his ſeruants patron? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſee how he gouerneth the tongues and hands of the infidels to the profit of thoſe that be his.</p>
               <p n="29">29 <hi>Whom I perceiued.</hi> In this place hee acquitteth Paul, ſo farre as his iudgement could reach. But let vs note that a profane ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſpeaketh. For amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the people of god, it is an offence worthy of no leſſe puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:7788:278"/> to corrupt the doctrine of godlineſſe with wicked and falſe opinions, than to doe iniurie too, or commit wickedneſſe among men. The Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans would not haue ſuffered their ſuperſtitions or feined worſhipings of their gods to be freedome; but foraſmuch as they made no account of the Law of God, yea ſeing they were deſirous to haue the ſame quite put out, it was among them no fault to beleeue Moſes and the Prophets no more, or to trouble the Church with falſe opinions. Therfore there was a Law that the gouernours ſhoulde not meddle with ſuch matters: but that thoſe who were abiding in the prouinces ſhoulde ſo retaine their religion, that if any thing were done contrary to the ſame, the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Magiſtrates ſhould not meddle with the puniſhing therof. This is the reaſon why the chief captain thinketh it no offenſe, to haue moued queſtions concerning the law. And vnder colour hereof vnlearned men will haue leaue granted to themſelues and others amiſſe to cauſe trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. The Lord ſaith farre otherwiſe, who doth more ſharply puniſh the violating of his worſhip, than any iniuries done to men. And ſurely no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more abſurd than to let thoſe who rob God of his honour ſcape ſcotfree, ſeing theft is puniſhed. But as the chiefe captaine careth not for the Iewiſh religion: ſo the falſe accuſations and ſlanders of the Iews are refuted, wherewith they would gladly haue burdened Paul.</p>

               </q>
               <p n="1">1 Seing Ananias goeth downe to Ceſarea to accuſe Paul, it maketh the coniecture more probable, which I brought before touching his Prieſthood. For it was not meet for the higheſt Prieſt to take ſuch a ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney: Therefore ſome other man was higheſt Prieſt at that time: and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanias being one of the chiefe Prieſts, foraſmuch as he was in great au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie and was withall a ſtout man, did take this ambaſſage vpon him. He bringeth with him a traine and that of the worſhipfull companie of Elders, that the Gouernour might be moued with their verie pompe to condemne Paul. But foraſmuch as Paul did vſe no eloquence, they had no neede to hire a Rhetorician, to contend with him in eloquence. Moreouer they did exceede both in dignitie and alſo in multitude, ſo that it was an eaſie matter for them to oppreſſe a poore man, and ſuch a one as was deſtitute of mans helpe. Therefore it was a ſigne of an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill conſcience, in that ſeing they were men of great experience, exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in publike affaires, and skilfull in matters pertaining to courts, they hyre a Rhetorician. Eloquence is I confeſſe, the gift of God: but in this matter they went about nothing elſe but to deceiue the iudge there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. And Luke declareth this therefore, that wee may know that the Iewes did omit nothing, whereby they might oppreſſe Paule: and that they might not onely prooue him giltie, but ſo daſh him out of counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, that he might not be able to defend himſelfe: and ſo let vs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that it came to paſſe by the wonderfull prouidence of God, that Paul did ſo ſtoutly endure ſuch ſore aſſaultes. Wherefore if it ſo fall out at any time that a godly man being alone be beſet with a great number of enimies, let him call to minde this hiſtorie, and let him bee of good courage.<note place="margin">Pſal. 27.3.</note> As Dauid doeth likewiſe exhort vs by his owne example, If tentes were pitched about mee, I will not feare, becauſe thou art with me.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>Seeing wee liue in great peace.</hi> Tertullus vſeth a preface nothing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent to the matter, becauſe hee commendeth Felix his wiſedome and vertues, that hee may purchaſe fauour. Therefore it is a filthie and flattering <hi>Exordium</hi> not that I am of their minde who reprehende Tertullus for ſpeaking the iudge faire, and for ſeeking to winne his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour.
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:7788:279"/> For it is not alwayes diſagreeing with the right and lawfull forme of pleading, to commende the iudge: and there may reaſons be brought on both ſides (as they ſay) touching this matter. But I miſlike nothing but this which is altogither corrupt. For the Rhetorician doth inſinuate himſelfe vnder falſe praiſes, that hee may darken the matter which is called in queſtion. For to what ende doeth he ſpeake of peace and a wel ordered ſtate, ſaue onely that Felix may think that the ſafetie of Iudea conſiſteth in condemning Paul, and that he may examine the matter no further? Moreouer it appeareth by Ioſephus how couetouſly, cruelly, and voluptuouſly Felix behaued himſelfe in that prouince. The vnworthy and tragicall murthering of the higheſt Prieſt Ionathas, becauſe he ſet himſelfe againſt his diſſolute tyranny, was alreadie paſt: and finally almoſt at the very ſame time Claudius Caeſar was enforced with the complaints of the whole nation, to put Feſtus in his place, and to call him to anſwere for himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Therefore we ſee how ſhamefullie this oratour did lie. And ſeeing all Pauls aduerſaries ſing the ſame ſong, we ſee that they bee blinded with hatred and malice, and that they trecherouſly betray the ſtate of their countrie: neither doe they paſſe what befall them ſo Paule may die the death. Where Eraſmus tranſlateth it, Many thinges are well done, the olde interpreter ſeemeth to come nearer vnto Paule his meaning, who ſaieth, that <hi>catorthomata</hi> are wrought, which ſignifieth as much as reformations or dreſſings. Therefore Tertullus commendeth the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrie of Felix, becauſe he had cleanſed Iudea from many corruptions, and he reſtored many things, which would otherwiſe haue decayed. To wit, to the ende he may the more greedily ſeeke to purchaſe the fauour of the nation (which he knew was otherwiſe offended with him) by the death of one man.</p>
               <p n="5">5 <hi>For wee founde this man.</hi> Tertullus dooth aime at a double marke. The firſt is this, that Paul may be deliuered to the Iewes, becauſe they be very skilfull in matters which concerne the worſhip of God and the Lawe of Moſes. But and if hee denie this, hee layeth to his charge a crime worthie of death, becauſe hee procured contention among the people. They knewe that the Romanes did hate nothing more: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they vrge that the ſoreſt againſt Paule. This doeth Tertullus am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifie when hee ſaieth, that Paul had moued the Iewes throughout the whole worlde. But I wonder why hee addeth that he is the authour or chiefe of the ſect of the Nazarites: which we know was rather a praiſe than a diſpraiſe among the Iewes. I thinke that they meane not thoſe who according to the olde and lawfull cuſtome of the Lawe did conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate themſelues to God: but thoſe troubleſome murtherers, who did alſo vaunt and boaſt that they were zealous men. Some thinke that Nazarites are heere put for Chriſtians: which may verie well bee. But if wee like the former expoſition better, hee doeth craftilie laye to Paule his charge that hee was one of that ſecte which the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines did hate. For where as theſe zealous men woulde aboue all other haue beene counted for notable obſeruers of the Lawe, they
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:7788:280"/> aduanced a colour of zeale as a banner to ſtir vp the minds of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people. Neuertheleſſe theſe good men who are ſo zealous ouer their libertie, doe not ſpare the chiefeſt maintainers thereof, ſo they may cauſe Paul to be hated by meanes of them. They would haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended the Nazarites as couragious defenders of the Lawe, if it had not bin in this matter, but now, as if they did infect the whole world, they ſeeke to bring vpon Paul great reproch by ſaying that he is one of them. Moreouer they ſlaunder Paul impudently, for no man did thinke that he was guiltie of that crime. Therefore they lay to his charge no leſſe wickedly than maliciouſly a crime which they take vp at their foote and inuent without all colour. But ſuch is the careleſſe ſecurity of hypocrits, that they thinke they may do whatſoeuer they will, ſo they colour their doings with zeale.</p>
               <p n="6">6 <hi>Who went about to pollute the Temple.</hi> It was a light and almoſt a fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolous accuſation to lay this to his charge before the Romane Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, who could haue wiſhed that the Temple had bin turned topſitur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie. But becauſe nothing was more fit for procuring vprores than the polluting of the Temple, he doth craftily accuſe Paul thereof: as if hee ſhould ſay, that it was no thankes to him that Ieruſalem was not on an vprore: and that hee carried ſuch a firebrande as might haue procured ſore hurt, if hee had not beene preuented. Alſo he includeth that other thing, that becauſe Paul had offended in matters of religion, it did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long properly to the Iewes, to giue iudgement in that matter. And here hee complaineth alſo of the chiefe captaine Lyſias, becauſe hee robbed them of their right. Therefore his drift is to obtaine at the hands of the Ruler that he wil reſtore to them that which Lyſias had taken from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. This is alſo not voide of ſubtiltie, in that Tertullus doeth diſcredite the chiefe captaine, becauſe hee dealt more courteouſly toward Paul than the Prieſts would he ſhould: and glauncingly hee bringeth him in ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe hee dare not openly accuſe him. But the queſtion is whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they could hope that the Gouernour would graunt them ſo much, ſeing the Romane magiſtrates alone were to ſit vppon life and death. I anſwere that hee maketh in this place ſome ſemblance of equitie, as if they were purpoſed to handle him more gentlie than hee deſerued. For though they might not condemne any man to death, yet they might vſe ſome light chaſtiſement as was ſcourging. Neuertheleſſe Tertullus doth not ceaſe to deſire before the preſident to haue him put to death.</p>
               <p n="8">8 <hi>Hauing made inquirie.</hi> A good requeſt, that the Gouernour doe not giue ſentence before hee throughly examine and know the matter: and that he do not condemne Paul before he be lawfully conuict. But howe dare they put in theſe conditions, ſeing their owne conſciences doe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe them of vniuſt dealing? I anſwere that they had witneſſes in redi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: and that they do not offer themſelues to proue the matter vntill they do cal the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> though there were another end. For they did hope that Felix would be ſo perſwaded with ſuch glorious words, that hee woulde turne ouer vnto them the man whom they did accuſe, for a condemned man, whom they might handle at their pleaſure. In ſumme, the more
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:7788:280"/> fierce they be vppon him, and the more they were puffed vp with ſome affiance they had in themſelues, they thinke they ſhall get the vpper hand by this meanes: becauſe the partie arreigned ſhal haue no licence granted to defend himſelfe. Thus doe falſe accuſars boldly boaſt, that their matter is plaine that they may blind the eyes of the iudges.</p>

Therefore omitting the cauſe of the Goſpell, which his accuſer had not touched, he anſwereth ſimplie vnto the crimes whereof he was accuſed. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he come thither, he ſaith that he doth the more willingly anſwere for himſelfe before Felix, becauſe he had long time beene gouernour of Iudea: becauſe peraduenture ſome new gouernour would haue bin ſore moued hearing ſuch things laid to his charge. He doth not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend the vertues of the gouernour, but he ſaieth that he is glad, becauſe hee is of great experience, that he may iudge more iuſtly. This is ſurely a ſyncere and free manner of defending, to ſet matter againſt wordes. Yet Paule ſemeth to gather amiſſe, that Felix can know the time of his comming, becauſe he had bene gouernour many yeeres. I anſwere that this is ſaid therefore, becauſe it is likely that he wil deale more moderately: as if he
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:7788:281"/> ſhould ſay, Becauſe thou haſt bin acquainted with their conditions long time, I haue the better hope that they ſhall not deceiue thee. For want of skill doth make iudges too credulous, and doth inforce them to make too much haſte.</p>

Wherefore though he came to Ieruſalem for ſome other cauſe, yet this is alwayes true, that he came with no other minde, but to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe himſelfe to be a worſhipper of God, and to approue the holineſſe of the Temple by his worſhipping. The other queſtion is more harde, how he ſaith that he came to worſhip, ſeing the religion of the temple was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie aboliſhed, and all difference of the temple taken away. I anſwere in this place likewiſe, that though he do not make his purpoſe knowne, yet he doth not lie or diſſemble. For the faithfull ſeruants of Chriſt were not forbidden to worſhippe in the Temple, ſo they did not tie holineſſe to the place: but did lift vp pure handes freely without making choice of places.<note place="margin">

Tim. 2.8.</note> It was lawfull for Paul to enter into the temple after he was come to Ieruſalem, that hee might make his godlineſſe knowne, and there to vſe the ſolemne rites of the worſhippe of God, becauſe he was voide of ſuperſtition: ſo hee did not offer any propitiatorie ſacrifices which were contrarie to the Goſpel. Therefore religion did not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel him to come to Ieruſalem according to the appointment of the law, as if the ſanctuarie were the face of God as in times paſt: yet hee doeth not abhorre the external worſhippe which was vnto men a teſtimonie of godlineſſe.</p>
               <p n="12">12 <hi>Diſputing with any man.</hi> Paule had no neede to denie any of theſe things if he had done them: becauſe hee might haue anſwered for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe that it was wel done. He had bin one of the Scribes which diſputed daily: neither were they forbidden either by the Law or by cuſtome, but that they might aſſemble themſelues togither to bee taught. Yea to this end there were in diuerſe places of the Cittie Synagogues, wherin they met togither. Moreouer hee knewe that both Chriſt and alſo his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles had done the ſame thing. Alſo he might eaſily haue turned backe vppon his aduerſaries the crime which they did obiect to him, who did dayly vſe the very ſame things. But becauſe he aimeth at no other thing at this preſent, but to refute the falſe accuſations of his aduerſaries, and to proue that importunate men had vnaduiſedly moleſted him for no cauſe: hee intreateth not of the lawfulneſſe of the fact (as they ſay) but onely of the fact. And hee ſtandeth chiefely vppon this point to refute that ſlaunder, becauſe hee was burdened to bee a raiſer of tumultes. Therefore hee concludeth that hee was falſely and vniuſtly accuſed: becauſe the aduerſaries had neuer prooued thoſe thinges which they had alleaged. This ought to haue beene ſufficient to diſcharge him, ſeeing hee was thus burdened with wicked lies, whereas there reſted
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:7788:281"/> in him not the verie leaſt ſuſpicion that could be deuiſed.</p>
               <p n="14">14 <hi>But I confeſſe.</hi> Becauſe they had laide to Paul his charge impietie and the polluting of the Temple, hee purgeth himſelfe of both nowe, that Felix may vnderſtand that his aduerſaries were mooued with euill will. For though the religion which is pretended bee falſe and prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterous, yet the ſtudie thereof did oftentimes finde fauour with men, who tooke no great heede. Wherefore it was to bee feared leaſt Felix, if he had conceiued any ſiniſter ſuſpition of Paul, ſhould not onely haue pardoned the zeale of the Prieſtes, but alſo haue graunted their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtes. Wherefore Paule doeth alſo refute this point of the accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and that ſo, that hee doeth not touch the faith of the Goſpel: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe (as wee haue ſaide) that was no fit place for making confeſſion thereof. But what is this, that hee ſaieth that hee worſhippeth God according to the way which they call hereſie? Some thinke that this is added like to a conceſſion: becauſe the enimies take that in euil part which ought to bee attributed to iudgement and right Election: as if Paule had ſaide; that that forme of religion which hee had followed is in deede called hereſie, but vnworthelie. But ſeeing that name was not infamous either among the Iewes or Gentiles, it is vnlikely that hee maketh aunſwere before a prophane man touching that which they counted euery where rather a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendation than any vice. When Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians haue conference togither, the Spirit of God commaundeth that heretikes bee counted detectable: and hee teacheth vs to beware of hereſies, becauſe they bring vppon the Church plague, diſſention and waiſtneſſe. Therefore it is a thing not to be ſuffered among the people of God, whoſe ſafetie conſiſteth in the vnitie of faith. But becauſe the Iewes did then openly boaſt of their ſectes, that excuſe whereof wee ſpake of late was ſuperſtuous. Therefore it remaineth that hee doe ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meane that he is a Phariſie, or that hee call the Iewiſh religion or the profeſſion of the Goſpell (without infamie) hereſie: becauſe they were diſtinguiſhed from the vſe and cuſtome of all nations. Seeing hee did before confeſſe himſelfe to bee a Phariſie, there ſhall no incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenience enſue, if wee ſay that hee doeth repeate the ſame nowe: eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſeeing hee ſpeaketh ſhortly after of the reſurrection of the deade. But becauſe this firſt point doeth onely containe a confeſſion concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the worſhippe of the God of the fathers, I th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nke that hee doeth rather ſpeake generally of the Iewiſh religion, or of the Chriſtian faith which did flowe thence. Paul was a Citizen of Rome, notwithſtanding as he came of the Iewes by his aunceſtrie, hee confeſſeth that hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth in the religion which hee had learned of the fathers. And to this ende doeth the aduerbe of likeneſſe tende: for it ſheweth a knowne thing, namely, the manner of worſhippe whereunto the Iewes were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted. Hee maketh expreſſe mention of the God of his fathers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was not lawfull for a man that was a Romaine to receiue the doctrine of the Lawe vnleſſe hee had come of the Iewes. Alſo hee toucheth his aduerſaries, which handle him ſo cruellie: whereas not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:7788:282"/> they both worſhip one God. I (ſaith he) worſhip the ſame God (according to the manner deliuered by mine anceſtours) which they themſelues worſhip, and euen as they worſhip him. Neither doth that hinder becauſe he was fallen from the ceremonies of the Law, and was content with the ſpirituall worſhip of God. For Paul thinketh it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for him to wipe away that blotte of impiete which his aduerſaries had falſely caſt vpon him. Therefore the Papiſtes are ridiculous, who feigne that Paul alloweth all manner antiquitie. Wee ſay they worſhip the God of our fathers with Paule, as the cuſtome was deliuered to vs from hand to hande: as if (euen they themſelues being iudges) it were ſufficient for the Iewes or Turks to hold vp the ſame buckler againſt the faith of Chriſt. But the apoſtle meant nothing leſſe tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſimply to ground religion in the authoritie of anceſtours, and to defend his godlines with that defenſe, which might haue bin common to all the ſuperſtitions of the Gentiles: hee meant onely to ſtoppe the mouth of his aduerſaries. Neuertheleſſe he taketh this for a plaine matter, that the Fathers from whom the Iewiſh religion came, were good and ſyncere worſhippers of God: ſo that the Iewes which wer not degenerate might well boaſt, that the God of their fathers whom they worſhipped, was the onely creatour of heauen and earth: &amp; that the country gods of al the reſt of the world, were meere and vaine inuentions.</p>

                  <hi>Beleeuing all things.</hi> A ſhort expoſition of the ſentence next going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. For becauſe he had not ſimplie affirmed that he worſhipped God, but did adde this word <hi>outos</hi> or ſo: he doth now ſet downe how hee wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippeth God. Whereby it appeareth what great heede he taketh for feare he intangle himſelfe in thoſe accidentall ſuperſtitions which reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned among the Iewes. As if any of vs do at this day anſwere the papiſts that he worſhipeth the God whom they profeſſe, as we be taught out of the Law &amp; out of the Goſpel. By this let vs learn that God is not rightly worſhipped: ſo that our obedience can pleaſe him, vnleſſe it be of faith, which is the onely ground-worke of godlineſſe. For he (to the end hee may proue himſelfe to bee the ſeruant of God) doeth not thruſt vppon them bare ceremonies: but he ſaith flatly, that He beleeueth. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more this place containeth a profitable doctrine, that this is the onely foundation of right and true faith, for a man to ſubmit himſelfe to the Scripture, and reuerently to embrace the doctrine thereof. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more Paul doth in this place diuide the ſcripture into the Law and the Prophets, that he may the more plainly proue that he doth not diſſent from the vniuerſall conſent of the Church.</p>
               <p n="15">15 <hi>Hoping in God.</hi> Wee muſt note the courſe of his ſpeech. For after that he hath profeſſed that he beleeueth the ſcripture, hee doeth nowe adde the hope of the reſurrection to come, that it may appeare that it commeth not from the vnderſtanding of the fleſh, or from the decrees of men, but it is conceiued out of the worde of God. Thus doeth the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance of the Scripture goe before, that it may hold vs faſt bound, and it is the beginning of faith. After that the knowledge of thoſe thinges which God hath reuealed there, doth follow, being coupled and linked
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:7788:282"/> with ſure hope. And whereas he maketh them his fellowes, it is referred vnto the ſounder ſort. Though it be not to be doubted, but that he ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth by this meanes and pollicie to bring them out of their lurking pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces into the cleare light and that before Felix: as it ſhal againe appeare by the concluſion of the defenſe. But in this place the generall reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is defended againſt certain braineſicke fellowes, who reſtraine the ſame vnto the members of Chriſt. But as Paul doth in this place ſay that al men ſhal riſe againe, ſo by the plain voyce of Chriſt al are cited: ſome vnto iudgement, ſome vnto life. Iohn. 5.29.</p>
               <p n="16">16 <hi>And herein doe I ſtudie.</hi> There is no ſharper prick to prick men for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward with all deſire to lead a godly &amp; holy life, then the hope of the laſt reſurrection, as the ſcripture teacheth in many places. Therefore when Paul wil effectually exhort the faithful any where, he calleth them back to remember the ſame.<note place="margin">Phil. 3.20.</note> Wherefore it is not without cauſe that he ſaith in this place, that ſtaying himſelfe vpon this faith hee hath indeuoured to liue purely before God, and righteouſlie among men. And ſurely an euill conſcience is as good as a thouſande witneſſes to accuſe men of blockiſhneſſe: that they may gather for a certaintie that they doe not earneſtly and throughly beleeue eternall life, after which they neuer long. He calleth it a conſcience <hi>aproſcopon</hi> that is without offence: where the ſeruants of God labour to remoue al lets which hinder their courſe. And he putteth two parts of the conſcience. For there is a certaine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſenſe or feeling, which beholdeth God alone: &amp; thence commeth faithfulnes and integritie, which we vſe toward men. At length when he ſath that he hath conſtantly followed as wel godlines in worſhiping god, as iuſt dealing among men, he ſignifieth vnto vs that thoſe do in deede hope for the laſt reſurrection, who are neuer wearie of well doing. For this word Alwayes doth ſignifie perſeuerance in a ſtraight courſe.</p>
               <p n="17">17 <hi>And after many yeares.</hi> His meaning is that he had not of long time bin at Ieruſalem, but was conuerſant in other countries farre diſtant, and that after long time hee came nowe to bring almes and to offer to God the ſacrifice of thankes. Whereby doth alſo appeare their want of good nature &amp; their vnthankfulneſſe, becauſe ſeing he had by al meanes deſerued the goodwill of all the whole nation, they recompence him ſo euill. This place doth expound the former, where mention was made of worſhipping. For it is certaine that Paul came not purpoſely to offer in the Temple: becauſe he purpoſed to do that after he was come. But he doth onely recite what the Iewes founde in him, which was of greateſt weight for the matter which was now in hand. At length when he ſaith that hee was found in the Temple doing this, and that, hauing firſt vſed ſolemne purging, and ſecondly, quietly without raiſing any tumult, he cleareth himſelfe againe of both crimes. For his purifying did witneſſe that hee did not pollute the Temple. And ſecondly for as much as he did it quietlie without any multitude, there was no ſuſpition of tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult.</p>

But thoſe who are to bee blamed for the matter, and who were as fannes to ſet all on fire, appeare not. After that Paul hath turned backe the crime vppon others, taking to himſelfe a good courage, he doth nowe appeale vnto the aduerſaries which are preſent, willing them if they know any thing by him, freely to vtter it: though I diſſent from Eraſmus and the olde interpreter in the participle <hi>ſtantos,</hi> for they tranſlate it in the preſent tence: and they expound the worde <hi>ſunedrion</hi> or Councel, of the ſitting of the Gouernour, which I thinke, is farre from Paul his meaning. For his meaning is in my iudgement, that hee was readie to giue an account of all thinges in their councell. And that they knew nothing then which they can lay to his charge: becauſe they began to ſturre onely for this one voice, when he ſaide that he was iudged of the reſurrection of the dead: that is, that hee ſuffered all this trouble for no other cauſe, ſaue onely becauſe he did hope for the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the dead. Whereby it appeareth that they now coyne a newe accuſation for no cauſe: becauſe if there had bene in him any fault, they woulde not haue conſealed it then. It is likelie that they had farther talke, and that they came nearer togither: becauſe we ſhal ſee elſewhere that they did contende about Chriſt: but it was Luke his drift onely to declare howe well Paul had cleared himſelfe of the falſe accuſations of his accuſers.</p>

For when Luke ſaieth that the matter was deferred vntill the comming of Lyſias,
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:7788:283"/> he putteth in this in ſteed of a reaſon, that The ruler did perfectly know thoſe thinges which did appertaine vnto the way: by which wordes I thinke is ſignified either that through long experience hee had beene acquainted with the conditions of the Prieſtes, and knewe full well howe they were wont to behaue themſelues: or elſe that hee ſawe by theſe things which had beene ſpoken on both ſides, howe friuolous the accuſation was: which is confirmed by the courteous and remiſſe vſage of Paul: for he putteth a Centurion in truſt with him, that he may haue the more libertie. Others had rather reade it in one text in the perſon of Felix: When Lyſias, who doth better knowe the trueth of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is come, I will then giue iudgement. But they ſet and gather this racked ſenſe from a reaſon which is ſcarce firme. They ſay that this word Way, is no where taken for the doctrine of the Lawe without ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. But I doe not interpret it of the Law, but of thoſe ſectes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of no ſtrangers were ignorant. No man did doubt, but that the Phariſies did hold the immortalitie of the ſoule. Therefore ſeing it was a thing ſo common, no maruel if Felix doe acquit Paul. Furthermore it were hard to take Way, for the knowledge of the fact. And I ſee not howe this can hange togither that the Gouernour doth confeſſe that Lyſias was more expert in the Law than he. But his innocencie is made more famous &amp; euident by this, becauſe a profane man did ſtreightway giue ſuch a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice thereof, that hee did ſuffer him to be viſited and holpen by his friends, being as it were exempted from the order of priſoners. Alſo we gather by this that Paul his companions and the reſidue of the Church had not forſaken him. For to what end had it bin to grant libertie to his friends and acquaintance to haue acceſſe vnto him, vnleſſe they had bin preſent, had ſhewed themſelues to be carefull for him, and had bin deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to do their dutie? Therefore let vs learne by this example, that ſo long as we may and are able, we muſt not defraud the martyrs of Chriſt of any manner of comfort, whiles they labour for the Goſpel.</p>

Luke doth not expreſſe thus much, but in that he nameth Druſilla, we may well gather that Paul was called for her ſake, that he might diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute of the goſpel. Though ſuch reuolts be rather tickled with curioſity, than moued with a ſincere deſire to learne.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He heard him touching the faith.</hi> This confeſſion of Paul doth witneſſe that hee did not ſpare to ſpeake of Chriſt before, becauſe he was afraid, or becauſe hee would eſcape the trouble of the croſſe: but becauſe it was not yet time to ſpeake. Seeing hee was cited vnto the iudgement ſeate to aunſwere for himſelfe, it ſtoode him vppon to aunſwere con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the crimes which were obiected to him, that hee might after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward frankly and freely profeſſe the faith of Chriſt. Therefore when he nowe ſeeth the gate ſet open and opportunitie offered for ſpeaking, he is not affraide to offende the Gouernour, neither is hee terrified with daunger, that hee doeth craftilie make as if hee were not a Chriſtian. Therefore wee ſee that hee was as well furniſhed with inuincible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie, as with wiſedome and iudgement: neither did hee euer of ſet purpoſe ſuppreſſe the light of the Goſpell, but did onely make choice of the time.</p>
               <p>Nowe the wonderfull counſell of God is woorth the noting in this place, who will haue the Goſpell offered ſometimes to the reprobate: not that they may profite thereby, but rather that they may bee made inexcuſable. It had bin better for Felix and Druſilla neuer to haue heard any thing concerning Chriſt: becauſe they did not eſcape without pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment for refuſing the grace of ſaluation which was offered to them, or for neglecting the ſame with loathſomneſſe. Furthermore wee muſt note this, that certaine by reaſon of that ſeede of godlineſſe which is in them ingendred, do deſire to heare the Goſpel preached, which ſo ſone as they haue heard, they doe by and by either loath or elſe they cannot ſuffer it. Neuertheleſſe the preaching of the Goſpel, (what ſucceſſe ſo euer it haue) is a good and ſweete ſauour to God: whether it quicken, or kill men.<note place="margin">2. Cor. 2.15.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="26">26 <hi>And as he diſputed.</hi> Felix hoped that he ſhould take ſome delight in Pauls ſermon: as men who are deſirous of new things, doe willinglie feede their eares with ſubtile diſputations: alſo hee meant to ſatiſfie his wiues deſire without his owne trouble: now he is enforced to feele that force of the worde of God whereof he neuer thought, which driueth away all his delightes. Paule out of bondes diſputeth of the iudgement of God: hee which had power to put him to death or to ſaue his life, is afraid and quaiketh as if he ſtoode before his owne iudge: neither doth he finde, any other comfort, but to ſend him away out of his ſight. Let vs firſt learne by this, what great force of the Spirite of God there was both in the heart and alſo in the tongue of Paul, becauſe he ſeeth that hee muſt ſpeake in the name of Chriſt, hee doeth not behaue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe like an vnderling: but hee declareth the ambaſſage which was inioyned him, with a grace, as from on high, and hauing forgotten
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:7788:284"/> that he was in bondes, hee denounceth the heauenly iudgement in the perſon of Chriſt. And nowe ſeing Felix his heart is ſo pricked with the voyce of a priſoner, the maieſtie of the Spirit doeth ſhew it ſelfe in that alſo, which Chriſt extolleth: when the Spirite ſhall come he ſhall iudge the worlde &amp;c. and that force of prophecying,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 14.24.</note> which the ſame Paule ſetteth forth elſewhere. Alſo that is fulfilled which he ſaith in another place, that The worde of God was not bounde with him: which hee did not onely ſtoutly maintaine and affirme to bee true, but which did effectually pearce into the heartes of men (and that of ſuch as were proude of their greatneſſe) as if it did lighten from heauen. Againe wee muſt note that although the reprobate bee ſtriken with the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, yet are they not renewed vnto repentance by that ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour alone. Felix is touched in deed when he heareth that God ſhall be the iudge of the world: yet hee flieth therewithall from his iudgement ſeat: (whereof he is afraide) ſo that this is feigned ſorrow which doeth not worke ſaluation. Therefore repentance requireth ſuch feare as may both engender a voluntarie hatred of ſinne, and may alſo preſent a man before God, that he may willingly ſuffer himſelfe to bee iudged by his worde. And this is a token of true profiting when the ſinner ſeeketh for medicine there, from whence hee receiued his wounde. Furthermore this place doth teach that men are then examined &amp; tried to the quick, when their vices wherewith they are infected are brought to light, and their conſciences are called backe vnto the iudgement to come. For when Paule diſputeth of righteouſneſſe and temperance, hee did rubbe Felix ſore vppon the gall: foraſmuch as he was both a man giuen to fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie pleaſure, and alſo to diſſolute riot, and giuen ouer vnto ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie.</p>
               <p n="27">27 <hi>Hoping that money.</hi> Though Felix had throughly tried Pauls inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gritie, ſo that hee was aſhamed to take money of the Iewes for condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning him: yet foraſmuch as hee was a couetous man, and a man giuen to corruptions, he would not acquite him for nothing: for this cauſe he doeth often call Paule, that hee may with faire words put him in ſome hope of deliuerance. For iudges which gape after money doe inſinuate themſelues thus, when as they will make way for corruptions. Whence we gather that it was but a vaine and tranſitorie feare, wherewith Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix was taken when hee heard Paul diſpute: ſeing hope of gaine doeth compell him to call for him, whom he was enforced with feare to ſend away. Howe did Felix hope for ſome rewarde at the handes of a poore man, and one that was deſtitute? for that goulfe would not haue beene content with a ſmall pray. I doe not doubt but that (as thoſe who haue the Lawe and right to ſell are wittie and can perceiue things) when hee ſaw the Iewes did make ſuch earneſt ſuite to haue Paul put to death, he ſmelled ſomwhat a farre off touching him: to wit, that hee was none of the common ſort; but ſuch a man as was in great fauour with manie. Wherefore he did not doubt but that many of his friends would willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beſtow coſt, to redeeme him.</p>
               <p n="28">28 <hi>And when two yeares were expired.</hi> Seeing Paul knew that the Iudge
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:7788:285"/> who did gape for gaine, would be fauourable to him ſo ſone as he ſhould offer him money, &amp; ſeing he had ſufficient time to gather the ſame: it is likely that hee did not onely beare with the Brethren, but alſo deteſt ſuch briberie, wherewith the holineſſe of ciuill order is ſhamefully pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted. Nowe whereas gouernours vſe to let loſe ſuch priſoners as they know are not guiltie when they goe from the prouince: Felix tooke the contrarie way to winne fauour. The Iewes had often complained of his filthie gaine, of his extortion, cruelty, and vnrulie gouernement. Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius Ceſar being wearied with ſo many complaints, did call him out of Iudea. To the end the Iewes may not ſpite him ſo ſore, he leaueth Paul bounde. So that hee maketh the guiltleſſe ſeruaunt of God as it were an offering for his euill deedes, that hee may therewithall appeaſe the Prieſts.</p>

               <p n="1">1 <hi>Then when Festus.</hi> The ſeconde action is deſcribed in this place, wherein Paul hath as hard a cumbate, and is in no leſſe daunger then in the firſt. Seing he was left in bondes, Feſtus might ſuſpect that the cauſe was doubtfull, and ſo gather an vniuſt preiudice. But there was another thing which was cauſe of greater daunger. Wee know that newe rulers, becauſe they will winne the fauour of thoſe who are in the prouinces, vſe to grant them many thinges at their firſt comming: ſo that it was to be thought that the death of Paul, ſhould be to Feſtus a fine meanes to winne fauour withall. Therefore the faith of the holy man is aſſailed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh with a newe triall, as if the promiſe had beene vaine whereto hee
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:7788:285"/> had hitherto truſted: but the grace of god doth ſo much the more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhewe it ſelfe in deliuering him, becauſe, contrarie to all hope, hee is deliuered out of the iawes of death. The Iewes preuent the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour with their falſe accuſations: yet they doe not as yet ſeeke to haue him puniſhed, but they doe onely deſire, that hee may not bee brought into any forraine court to plead his cauſe. They deſire that am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitiouſly as a great benefite, which was to looke to equal. How is it then that they do not obtaine, ſaue onely becauſe God doth holde the minde of Feſtus, ſo that he doth ſtoutly deny that, which he was afterward rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to graunt? And as the Lord did then holde his mind bound with the ſecreat bridle of his prouidence: ſo when hee graunted him freedome of will, he bounde his handes, that hee could not execute that which hee would. Let this confidence ſupport vs in daungers, and let it alſo ſtirre vs vp to call vppon God: and let this make our mindes quiet and calme, in that the Lord in ſtretching forth his hand and breaking ſuch a ſtrong conſpiracie, did ſhew an eternal example of his power in defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his.</p>
               <p n="5">5 <hi>Thoſe therefore.</hi> It is in the Greek worde forwarde, Thoſe who are mightie or able: yet he meaneth thoſe who can conueniently. Alſo wee may eaſily coniect, that they did obiect the trouble and charges, and beſought the Gouernour that he would not make weary with a ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous iourney ſo many of their chiefe men, and alſo certaine which were verie aged: b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t would rather (which hee might eaſily doe) commaund Paul to be brought by a fewe keepers. Therefore leaſt they complaine that he is burdenous vnto them, hee vnloadeth them of this neceſſitie, and giueth them leaue to chooſe out from among themſelues ſuch as they will. In the meane ſeaſon he doth ſufficiently declare, that he doth not beleeue their falſe reports: and he profeſſeth that he will bee an vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right iudge, and will do nothing but according to the truth of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The next ſentence alſo is diuerſly read among the Grecians. For ſome bookes haue the ſame which is in the olde interpreter, But eight or tenne dayes. If this reading like vs, the ſenſe ſhalbe, that The gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour came ſhortly after to Ceſarea, leaſt the Iewes ſhoulde be importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate vppon him vnder colour of his long tariance. The other reading which is more vſuall among the Grecians, ſhall haue another meaning: Though he ſtayed long inough at Ieruſalem to heare the matter, yet did hee not harken to their requeſtes, who woulde haue Paule brought thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whence we may gather a probable coniecture, that hee alreadie knew of their laying await.</p>
               <p n="7">7 <hi>Manie and greeuous crimes.</hi> So long as Paule liued vnder the Lawe his integritie was well knowne and famous. Againe when hee was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted to Chriſt, he was a ſingular patterne of innocencie. Yet wee ſee howe he is ſubiect to many ſlanders, cruel &amp; falſe accuſations. And this is almoſt alwaies the eſtate of the ſeruants of Chriſt: wherfore they muſt be the more couragious to paſſe valiantly through euill report and good report: neither let them thinke it ſtrange to bee euill reported of where they haue done good.</p>
               <pb n="552" facs="tcp:7788:286"/>
               <p>In the meane ſeaſon they muſt do their indeuour, that they may not onely haue a cleare conſcience before God, but that they may be verie well able to defende themſelues before men, when they haue time and place. For Paul doth not faile in his cauſe: but couragiouſly ſetteth the defenſe of his innocencie againſt their falſe crimes. Furthermore let vs note that the wicked can neuer bee bridled, but they will ſpeake euill of good men, and will impudently ſlaunder them: for they reſemble the nature of Satan, by whoſe ſpirite they are led. Therefore where as wee be commanded to ſtoppe the mouth of the wicked, it muſt not be ſo ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, as if hee ſhall be free from all backbiting, whoſoeuer ſhall behaue himſelfe vprightly: but that our life may aunſwere for vs, and may wipe away al blots of falſe infamie. So we ſee the aduerſaries of Paul, though they had a fauourable iudge, yet their ſlaunders were all in vaine, ſeing he did defende and auouch his innocencie by his deedes. And yet it is likely that they wanted not falſe witneſſes, neither were they ſlacke in ſuborning them: but becauſe the Lorde giueth his ſeruauntes inuinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſtrength, ſo that the brightneſſe of honeſtie doeth driue away their vaine clouds: they are aſhamed, and at length they depart from the iudgement ſeat with this infamie, that they were falſe accuſars. But the defenſe of Paul doeth ſhewe what things the Iewes laide principally to his charge. The firſt crime was vngodlineſſe againſt God, that he ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw the Lawe and polluted the Temple: the other, rebellion againſt Ceſar, and the Romane Empyre, becauſe hee raiſed tumultes euerie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. Hee was holpen by the ſingular grace of God to aunſwere and refute both, who maketh the innocencie of his as bright as the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>

For Feſtus doeth not openly contemne or hate Paul: but ambition, and peraduenture alſo deſire of gain got the vpper hand, ſo that for pleaſing the other part, he doth vniuſtly bring him in danger of death: alſo it is
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:7788:286"/> likely that he was enticed with the ſmel of ſom reward to harke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly to the prieſtes. Notwithſtanding I maruell that he giueth Paul leaue to chooſe, and doth not rather according to this authoritie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund them to carry him whether he would or no. Surely wee gather that he was kept backe with feare, leaſt he ſhould infringe the priuilege of the citie of Rome, which was a very odious crime. Notwithſtanding he ſtudieth craftilie to perſuade Paul not to refuſe to be iudged at Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem. For he was not ignorant of that which indeed came to paſſe, that a citizen of Rome might lawfully appeale, ſo that he could then goe no farther.

               <p n="10">10 <hi>I ſtand at Caeſars iudgement ſeat.</hi> Becauſe Paul ſeeth that hee is betraied into the handes of the Iewes through the ambition of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour, he obiecteth the priuiledge of the citie of Rome. Hee had ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted himſelfe modeſtly, if he had cmomaunded him to do that which was iuſt and equall. Nowe becauſe the gouernour doeth not his duetie willingly: neceſſitie compelleth the holy man to defend himſelf by law: and by this meanes the Lorde deliuereth him nowe againe euen when he was almoſt giuen ouer into the hands of the enemies. And wheras he deſireth to haue his matter handled before Caeſars iudgement ſeat: he doth not therefore make the doctrine of the Goſpell ſubiect to the iudgement of a profane and wicked man: but beeing readie to giue an account of his faith euery where: he appealeth from that court where he could no longer hope for equitie. Furthermore though the Citizens of Rome did retaine their priuiledge: yet the order was then altered: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Ceſars had taken into their owne handes the iudging of the people, as if they would bee good maintainers and patrons of common libertie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To the Iewes haue I done.</hi> Becauſe thoſe whoſe conſciences do accuſe them, and which miſtruſt their matter, flie vnto certaine odde excuſes and exceptions. Paul turneth away from himſelf this opinion. And ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie the miniſters of Chriſt, ought to haue no leſſe care to make their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie knowen, then to ſaue their life. If Paul had flatly denied to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere for himſelfe, the enemies would haue triumphed, and the doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of an euill conſcience ſhould haue been obiected to him to the reproch of the Goſpell. But now when he citeth the gouernour himſelfe to be a witneſſe of his integritie, and doth refuſe no puniſhment, if hee ſhall be found gyltie, he cutteth of all occaſion of ſlaunderous reportes. Therefore he ſheweth that he doth not ſeek to ſaue himſelfe by turning his back, but flieth vnto the fortreſſe of a iuſt defence, that he may ther ſaue himſelfe from iniurie, ſeeing his aduerſaries haue hitherto hande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him vniuſtly: and now refuſing to deale with him any longer by law they goe about to haue him murthered. Neither doth Paul go behinde the Preſidents back to tell him that he doth vniuſtly, in that he doth ſo dally with his accuſers: and therewithal he doth as it were bridle his luſt ſo that he dare goe no further.</p>
               <p n="11">11 <hi>I appeale vnto Caeſar.</hi> After that he hath profeſſed that hee doth

Wherefore if wee bee at any time brought into like ſtraits, we muſt not be ſuperſtitious, but we may craue help of the lawes and pollitike order.

<pb n="555" facs="tcp:7788:287"/> of, yet were Pauls bands famous: and that he was neuertheleſſe brought out of priſon, that he might make profeſſion of his faith, &amp; diſpute tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Goſpell before a famous auditorie, and againe that though he were contemned, yet was he not counted a wicked perſon, leaſt the glory of Chriſt ſhuld be abaſed by his ſlaunder and reproch, yea that he had more libertie to preach the goſpell being in priſon, then if hee had liued free in a priuate houſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>King Agrippa and Bernice,</hi> It is certaine that this Agrippa was ſonne to Agrippa the elder, whoſe filthie and deteſtable death was ſet downe in the twelfth chapter. When this man was made king of Chalcis in his vncles ſteed after the deceaſe of his father: hee did afterward obtaine a more large dominion. Bernice, of whom mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is made in this place, was his owne naturall ſiſter, which was firſt married to Herod king of Chalcis her vncle, and did keep her ſelf widdow a certaine ſeaſon after his death, yet ſhe did not liue honeſtly &amp; chaſtly during that time: for her too great familiaritie with her brother Agrippa was ſuſpected. And to the end ſhe might not be counted an inceſtuous perſon, ſhe married with Polemon king of Cilicia. Notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding becauſe ſhe gaue herſelf more to luſt than chaſtitie, ſhe forſooke him. The hiſtoriographers doe no where ſay, that ſhe was her brothers wife: and Ioſephus in his life aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigneth her a dominion of her owne in a part of Galilee. Therefore it is to be thought that foraſmuch as they were hardened in their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, they dwelt together not regarding what men did ſay: yet did they abſtain from marriage, leaſt their inceſtuous marriage ſhoulde bewray and alſo augment their crime. Neither is it any maruell that hee came for honours ſake to ſalute the gouernour, who did reigne only at the wil and pleaſure of another, and did depend vppon the necke and fauour of the Emperour of Rome, which he was to retain and nouriſh by meanes of the gouernour.</p>
               <p n="14">14 <hi>When many dayes.</hi> Therefore when (after ſome time was ſpent) they wanted matter of talk, as idle men vſe to inuent ſomewhat where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they may talke, mention was made of Paul, for Luke meant to note that, when he ſaid that after many dayes wer idly ſpent, Feſtus told the king of a certaine man which lay bound. And although hee doth heere both touch the malice of the Prieſts, and alſo make a ſhew of wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full equitie on his part, yet in that hee ſhortly after cleareth the partie which was accuſed, he condemneth himſelfe vnawares, when as he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth that he was enforced to appeale that he might not be carried to Ieruſalem.</p>
               <p>But when Feſtus commendeth the Romanes, he ſheweth what doth beſeeme iudges. And if nature did tel profane men thus much, that they muſt admit no ſuch fauour as may oppreſſe the giltleſſe: howe muche more muſt iudges, (who haue the light of the word of God) be carefull to auoide all corruption.</p>
               <p n="18">18 <hi>They laid no ſuch crime to his charge.</hi> I maruell why Feſtus doeth ſay that there was no ſuche crime obiected to Paul as hee ſuppoſed, ſeeing he was accuſed of ſedition: but we may againe coniect by this,
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:7788:288"/> yea, plainly know that their accuſations were ſo vaine, that they ought not to haue been brought before the iudgement ſeat: as if a man did vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a ſlaunderous ſpeech vnaduiſedly. For which cauſe he ſaith that the ſtate of the cauſe did conſiſt in queſtions of the law. Therefore wee ſee that he putteth a difference betweene thoſe offences which were wont to be puniſhed by mans lawes, and the controuerſie which was betwene Paul and the Iewes: not that religion ought to bee corrupted freely, or that their malapartneſſe is tollerable, who ouerthrowe the worſhip of god with their owne inuentions: but becauſe the man being a Romane, cared not for Moſes lawe: therefore hee ſpeaketh ſo diſdainfully when he ſaith, that they did ſtriue about their ſuperſtition. Though this word <hi>deiſidaimonia</hi> bee taken of the Grecians as well in good as euill part: to wit, becauſe the choice of worſhippings of falſe gods were common in al places. Notwithſtanding his meaning is that he careth not what maner religion the Iewes haue. And no maruell if a man which was an Ethnick and had not learned that the rule of godlineſſe muſt bee fet from the mouth of God, know not how to diſtinguiſhe between the pure worſhip of God and ſuperſtitions.</p>
               <p>Wherefore we muſt hold faſt that marke whereby wee may diſcerne the one from the other, that there is no godlines but that which is grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded in the knowledge of faith, leaſt we grabble in darkneſſe. Moreouer the Romans were ſo drunke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with proſperous ſucceſſe, that they thoght that they were more acceptable to God then any other: as at this day the Turks by reaſon of their manifolde victories deride the doctrine of Chriſt. This was a lamentable caſe, that a man being an vnbeleeuer and idolater, ſitteth as iudge amidſt the Iewes, to giue iudgement of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred oracles of God according to his ignorance, but all the fault was in Paul his aduerſaries, who did not care for the maieſtie of God, ſo they might ſatisfie and obey their owne madneſſe. Nothwithſtanding there reſted nothing for Paul to doe, but to cleare himſelfe of thoſe crimes which were laide againſt him. So at this day though inwarde brawles which are among Chriſtans, doe defame the name of Chriſte and his Goſpell among the Turkes and Iewes, yet the defender of holy doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine are vnworthily blamed, which are enforced to enter the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of one Ieſus.</hi> It is not to bee doubted but that Paul intreated both grauely and with ſuch vehemencie as became him of the reſurrection of Chriſte: But Feſtus by reaſon of his pride, thought it no meet matter for him to occupie his head about. Hee doth not in deed openly deride Paul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but he ſheweth plainly how negligently he hard him when he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted of Chriſt. Wherby we ſee, how little preaching auaileth, yea that it auaileth nothing at all, vnleſſe the Spirit of God doe inwardly touch the harts of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For the wicked do lightly paſſe ouer whatſoeuer is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, as if a man ſhould tell them a tale of Robin Hood. Wherfore there is no cauſe why the careleſneſſe of many ſhoulde trouble vs at this day, ſeeing Paul preuailed nothing with Feſtus. But this place doth witneſſe that many ſpeeches did paſſe in the handeling of the matter, whereof
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:7788:288"/> Luke maketh no mention. For he had ſpoken nothing as yet of Chriſte: and yet this latter narration doth ſhewe that Paul intreated ſeriouſlye before the Iewes of his death and reſurrection. Which coulde not bee, but hee muſt needes intreate of the principall pointes of the Goſpel. Therefore I geſſe that Paul did ſo handle the matter, that when he had refuted the falſe accuſations of the Iewes, wherewith they went about to burden him before the gouernour, hauing gotten a fit occaſion, hee began afterward to ſpeake freely of Chriſt.</p>

                  <p n="25">
                     <hi>25</hi> Yet haue I found that he hath committed nothing worthie of death. And becauſe hee hath appealed vnto Auguſtus, I haue determined to ſende him.</p>

                     <hi>26</hi> Of whom I haue no certaine thing to write vnto my Lord. Wherefore I haue brought him foorth vnto you, and chiefly vnto thee O king Agrippa, that after examination had, I may haue ſomewhat to write.</p>
                  <p n="27">
                     <hi>27</hi> For it ſeemeth to me an vnmeet thing to ſend a priſoner, and not to ſhew the crimes whereof he is accuſed.</p>
               </q>
               <p n="22">22 <hi>I would alſo.</hi> By this we may gather that Agrippa did ſo deſire to hear Paul that he was aſhamed to make his deſire knowen, leaſt Feſtus ſhould thinke that he came for ſome other end then to ſalute him. And it may be that not only curioſitie did moue him to be deſirous to heare Paul: but becauſe he did hope to profite by hearing him. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding we may eaſily gather by this, how cold his deſire was, becauſe hee ſuffered many dayes to paſſe before he ſheweth any ſigne of his deſire: becauſe he was more in loue with earthly commodities which he coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted better. Neither durſt he make any wordes, neither did he paſſe for vttering any ſpeech vntill ſuch time as Feſtus did of his owne accorde will him ſo to doe. So that the holy miniſter of Chriſt is brought foorth as on a ſtage, that a profane man may cheare vppe his gueſt: ſaue onely that Feſtus wil be holpen with the aduiſe of Agrippa and his company, that he may let Caeſar vnderſtand how diligent hee is. But the matter was turned to another end by the ſecrete prouidence of God: neither ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="558" facs="tcp:7788:289"/> they might not be enflamed with ſuch hatred againſt the goſpel: impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie was made aſhamed, and the faithfull did gather newe ſtrength, ſo that they were confirmed more and more in the goſpel.</p>
               <p n="23">23 <hi>And on the morrow.</hi> Agrippa and his ſiſter do not come like hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diſciples of Chriſt: but they bring with them ſuch pompe and gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geouſneſſe, as may ſtop their eares and blind their eyes: and it is to bee thought that like hautineſſe of minde was ioyned with that gorgeous &amp; great pompe. No maruell therefore if they were not brought to obey Chriſt. Notwithſtanding it ſeemeth that Luke maketh mention of the pompe, that we might know that in a great aſſembly, and before choiſe witneſſes whoſe authority was great, Paul had leaue graunted not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to plead his matter as a partie defendant, but alſo to preach the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel. For he commeth foorth as in the perſon of a teacher, that he may ſet foorth the name of Chriſt. So that the trueth of God brake out of his bands, which was foorthwith ſpread abroad euery where with a free courſe: yea it came euen vnto vs. By this word <hi>phantaſia</hi> Luke vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

For it was a thing credible, that he might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be perſuaded to lay away feare, and to ſubmit himſelf to the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and diſcretion of a iuſt iudge, eſpecially if Agrippa ſhould giue his friendly conſent. To what end ſoeuer he did it, he condemneth himſelfe of iniquitie by his owne mouth, in that he did not let a giltleſſe man go free, whom hee is now aſhamed to ſende vnto Caeſar, hauing nothing to lay againſt him. This did alſo come to paſſe by the wonderfull proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God that the Iewes themſelues ſhold giue a former iudgment on Pauls ſide. Paraduenture the Gouernor goeth ſubtilly to worke that hee may picke out what the kinge, and the chiefe men of Ceſarea doe think: that if it ſo fal out that Paul be ſet at liberty, he may lay the blame on their neckes. For he woulde not haue the prieſts to bee his enemies for nothing, vpon whom a good part of Ieruſalem did depend, and that was the beſt way that he could take in writing to Caeſar, to intermingle the authoritie of Agrippa. But the Lord (to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it belongeth to gouern euents contrary to mans expectatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) had reſpect vnto another thing, to wit, that when the clowdes of falſe accuſations were driuen away, Paul might more freely auouch ſound doctrine.</p>

               </q>
               <p n="2">2 We haue declared to what end Paul was brought before that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly: to wit, that Feſtus might write vnto Ceſar as he ſhoulde bee counſailed by Agrippa and the reſt. Therefore he doth not vſe any plain or vſuall forme of defence, but doeth rather apply his ſpeech vnto doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine. Luke vſeth in deed a worde of excuſing: yet ſuch a one as is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing inconuenient whenſoeuer there is any account giuen of doctrine. Furthermore, becauſe Paul knew well that Feſtus did ſet light by al that which ſhould be taken out of the law and prophets, he turneth himſelfe vnto the king, who he hoped would be more attentiue, ſeeing he was no ſtranger to the Iewiſh religion. And becauſe hee had hitherto ſpoken to deaf men. He reioyceth now that he hath gotten a man who for his skil and experience can iudge aright. But as hee commendeth the skill and knowledge, which is in Agrippa, becauſe he is a lawfull iudge in thoſe matters whereof he is to ſpeake: ſo he deſireth him on the other ſide to heare him patiently. For other wiſe contempt and loathſomneſſe ſhuld haue been leſſe excuſeable in him. Hee calleth thoſe points of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which were handeled among the Scribes, queſtions: who were wont to diſcuſſe religion more ſubtilly. By the word <hi>cuſtomes</hi> he meaneth thoſe rites which were common to the whole nation. Therefore the ſumme is this, that king Agrippa was not ignorant either in doctrin, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the ceremonies of the law. That which he bringeth in or conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, wherefore I pray thee heare me patiently, (as I ſaide euen nowe) doeth ſignifie that the more expert a man is in the Scripture, the more attentiue muſt hee bee, when the queſtion is about religion. For that which we vnderſtand doth not trouble vs ſo much. And it is meete that we be ſo careful for the worſhip of god, that it doe not grieue vs to hear thoſe things which belong to the defining therof: and chieflie when we haue learned the principles: ſo that we may readily iudge, if we liſt, to take heed.</p>
               <p n="4">4 <hi>My life which I haue led.</hi> Hee doeth not as yet enter into the ſtate of the cauſe: but becauſe hee was wrongfully accuſed and burde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with many crimes, leaſte kyng Agrippa ſhoulde enuie the cauſe through hatred of the perſon, hee doeth firſt auouch his innocencie.
<pb n="590" facs="tcp:7788:290"/> For we know that when a ſiniſter ſuſpitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath once poſſeſſed the minds of men, all their ſenſes are ſo ſhut vppe, that they can admit nothing. Therefore Paul doeth firſt driue away the clowdes of an euill opinion, which were gathered of falſe reports, that he may be heard of pure and well purged eares. By this we ſee that Paul was enforced by the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie of the cauſe, to commend his life which he had lead before. But he ſtandeth not long vppon that point: but paſſeth ouer ſtraightway vnto the reſurrection of the dead, when he ſaith, that he is a Phariſee. And I think that that is called the moſt ſtraight ſect, not in reſpect of holines of life, but becauſe there was in it more naturall ſinceritie of doctrine, and greater learning. For they did boaſt that they knew the ſecret mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the ſcripture. And ſurely foraſmuch as the Sadduces did vaunt that they did ſticke to the letter, they fell into filthie and groſſe igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, after they had darkened the light of the ſcripture. The Eſſenes contenting themſelues with an auſtere and ſtraight kinde of life, dyd not greatly care for doctrine. Neither doth that any whit hinder, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt inueigheth principally againſt the Phariſees, as being the worſt corrupters of the ſcripture.<note place="margin">Mat. 23.13.</note> For ſeeing they did chalenge to them ſelues authoritie to interprete the ſcripture according to the hidden &amp; ſecrete meaning: hence came that boldneſſe to change and innouate, wherewith the Lord is diſpleaſed. But Paul doeth not touch thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions, which they had raſhly inuented, and which they vrged with tyrannous rigour. For it was his purpoſe to ſpeake only of the reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the dead. For thogh they had corrupted the law in many points: yet it was meete, that the authoritie of that ſect ſhould be of more eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in defending the ſound and true faith, then of the other which were departed farther from naturall puritie: Moreouer Paul ſpeaketh only of the common iudgement, which did reſpect the colour of more ſubtile knowledge.</p>
               <p n="6">6 <hi>For the hope of the promiſe.</hi> Hee doth now diſcend into the cauſe, to wit, that he laboureth for the principall point of faith. And though hee ſeeme to haue ſpoken generally of the reſurrection, yet we may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of the text, that he beginneth with a farther point: and that he did comprehend thoſe circumſtances, which did properly appertain vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the faith of the goſpel. He co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaineth that the Iewes did accuſe him, becauſe hee maintained the hope of the promiſe made to the fathers. Therefore this was the beginning and alſo the iſſue of the matter, that the couenant which God had made with the fathers, is referred vnto eternall ſaluation. Wherefore this was the ſumme of the diſputation, that the Iewiſh religion was nothing worth, vnleſſe they tooke heed to the heauens, and did alſo lift vp their eies vnto Chriſte the authour of the new life. They did boaſt that they were choſen from among all people of the worlde. But their adoption did profite them nothing, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they did truſt to the promiſed Mediatour, and looke vnto the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance of the kingdom of god. Therfore we muſt conceiue much more then Luke doth plainely expreſſe. And ſurely his narration tendeth to no other end, ſaue only that we may know of what thinges Paul intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:7788:290"/> But what this was, and in what words he vttered it, wee cannot tell, Neuertheles it behoueth vs to gather out of a brief ſumme thoſe things which appertaine vnto this diſputation: which was freely handeled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Agrippa, when Paul had free libertie graunted to him to plead his owne cauſe.</p>
               <p n="7">7 <hi>Whereunto our twelue tribes.</hi> Paul complaineth before Agrippa, that the ſtate of the churche is come to that paſſe that the Prieſtes ſet themſelues againſt the common hope of all the faithfull: as if he ſhould ſay, to what ende doe thoſe of our nation, who worſhippe God careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, and ſpend both dayes and nights in the dueties of godlineſſe, ſigh in their prayers, ſaue onely that they may at length come vnto eternall life? But the ſame is the marke whereat I aime in all my doctrine: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe when the grace of redemption is ſet before men, the gate of the kingdome of heauen is ſet open therewithall. And when I preach the authour of ſaluation raiſed vp from the dead, I offer the firſt frutes of immortalitie in his perſon. So that the former confirmation of his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine was taken out of the worde of God, when hee cited the promiſe made to the fathers. Now in the ſecond place he addeth the conſent of the church. And this is the beſt way to maintaine and auouch the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of faith, that the authoritie of God go formoſt: and that then the conſent of the church come next. Though we ought therewithall wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to make choyſe of the true church: as Paul doeth teache vs in this place by his owne example: for though hee knewe that the Prieſtes did pretend the viſure of the church againſt him: yet hee doeth boldly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme that the ſincere worſhippers of God are on his ſide, and he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with their defence. For when hee meaneth the twelue tribes hee doeth not ſpeake generally of al thoſe which came of Iacob according to the fleſhe: but hee meaneth thoſe onely, which did retaine the true ſtudie of godlineſſe. For it had been an vnmeet thing to commend the nation generally for the feare of GOD, which was onelie in a few.</p>
               <p>The Papiſts deale very diſorderedly in both: who by the voyces and conſents of men, oppreſſe the woorde of God, and giue alſo the name and tytle of the catholike church, to a filthie rabblement of vnlearned and impure men, without any colour or ſhame: but if wee will prooue that we thinke as the true church thinketh, wee muſt beginne with the Prophetes and Apoſtles: then thoſe muſt bee gathered vnto them whoſe godlineſſe is knowen and manifeſt. If the Pope and his Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie be not on our ſide, wee neede not greatly to care. And the true af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of true religion is proued by continuance &amp; vehemencie: which was of ſingular force at that time, principally when the Iewes were in greateſt miſerie.</p>
               <p n="8">8 <hi>Why ſhoulde.</hi> I doe not doubt but that he proued that both by reaſon and alſo by teſtimonies of ſcripture, which hee taught concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the reſurrection and the heauenly life. But for good cauſes doth hee callbacke thoſe vnto whom hee ſpeaketh, vnto the power of God, leaſt they iudge thereof according to their owne weake capacitie.

<pb n="563" facs="tcp:7788:291"/> which Luke hath hitherto recited, his ſpeech had not hanged well to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Whence we proue that which was ſaid before, that after that he had ſpoken of the couenant of God, hee intreated of the grace and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Chriſte, as the matter required. And hee repeateth the hiſtorie of his conuerſion for this cauſe, not only that he may remoue from him ſelfe all ſuſpition of lightneſſe: but that hee may teſtifie that God had called him, and that he was euen enforced by a commaundement com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from heauen. For ſeeing that he was, contrary to his expectation, ſodainly made a ſheepe of a woolfe, ſuch a violent change is of no ſmall importance to purchaſe credite to his doctrine.</p>
               <p>Therfore he amplifieth that his heat and vehement deſire which he had to puniſhe the members of Chriſte, and alſo that ſtubbornneſſe whereunto he was wholy giuen ouer. If hee had beene nouſled vppe in the faith of Chriſte from his youth, or if hee had been taught by ſome man, hee ſhould haue imbraced it willingly and without reſiſtaunce, hee himſelfe ſhoulde haue been ſure of his calling, but it ſhoulde not haue been ſo well knowen to others. But now ſeeing that beeing infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with obſtinate and immoderate furie, beeing moued with no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, neither perſuaded by mortall man, hee chaungeth his mynde; it appeareth that hee was tamed and brought vnder by the hande of God.</p>
               <p>Therefore this contrarietie is of great waight, in that hee ſaieth that hee was ſo puffed vp with pride that he thought hee ſhould get the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie of Chriſt: whereby hee teacheth that he was nothing leſſe, then made a diſciple of Chriſte through his own induſtry. The name of Ieſus of Nazareth is taken in this place for the whole profeſſion of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, which Paul ſought to extinguiſh, by making war ignorantly againſt God, as we may ſee.</p>
               <p n="10">10 <hi>Which thing I did.</hi> Hee prooueth by his very factes with what force of zeale hee was carryed away to ſtriue againſt Chriſt, vntill grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter force did pull him backe, and made him goe the quite contrary way. Furthermore his aduerſaries were witneſſes of this his vehemencie: ſo that it was moſt certaine that he was ſodainly chaunged: and vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedlie the prieſtes would neuer haue put him in any ſuch office, vnleſſe he had behaued himſelfe couragiouſly in exerciſing crueltie: and it was meete that hee ſhoulde bee very couragious who ſhoulde ſatifie their furie. This is alſo to be noted, that Paul was not aſhamed to confeſſe how ſore he had offended againſt God, ſo that that might turne to the glory of Chriſte. It was to him vndoubtedly reprochfull, to haue beene carried away with blinde zeal, ſo that hee enforced thoſe to blaſpheme which did deſire to ſerue God: to haue troubled the good and ſimple di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſly: to haue giuen ſentence of the ſhedding of innocent blood: final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to haue lifted vp his hornes euen vnto heauen, vntill hee was thro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen downe. But he doth not ſpare his own eſtimation, but doth willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie vtter his owne ſhame, that the mercy of God may the more plainely appeare thereby.</p>
               <pb n="564" facs="tcp:7788:292"/>
               <p>Wherefore there could no ſiniſter ſuſpition reſt in his ſpeech, ſeeing that (without hauing any reſpect of himſelfe) he ſaith, that he did vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offend in thoſe thinges whereby he gate the prayſe of all the people. Therefore hee condemneth his verie zeale of madneſſe, which others did honour. Whereby it appeareth how filthie the ambition of thoſe men is, who are aſhamed ſimply to confeſſe if they haue offended tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row ignorance or error. For although they doe not altogether excuſe the ſame, yet they goe about to leſſen or paint theſe thinges, for which they ought humbly with ſorrow and teares to craue pardon. But thogh Paul might haue retained the ſame of a couragious man, yet hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth that he was a mad man. For the participle which Luke vſeth importeth thus muche, that he compelled many to blaſpheme. By this wee know that there was great corruption euen in the very firſt fruites of beleeuers, ſeeing that hauing firſt profeſſed themſelues to bee diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Chriſte, and being afterwarde diſcouraged with feare or ſtripes, they did not onelye denie him, but alſo ſpake euill of his bleſſed name. Though the very deniall it ſelfe containeth an horrible blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie.</p>
               <p n="13">13 <hi>At midday, O king.</hi> The narration tendeth to this end, that king Agrippa may vnderſtand that it was no vaine viſure or ghoſt, neyther was it any ſuch traunce as brought him into ſome madneſſe, ſo that hee was deſtitute of iudgement. For though he fell to the earth for fear, yet he heareth a plaine voice: he asketh who it was that ſpake: hee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth the anſwere which was made: which are ſignes that he was not beſide himſelfe. Hereupon it followeth that hee did not raſhly chaunge his minde, but did godlily and holily obey the heauenly oracle: leaſt he ſhould of ſet purpoſe proceed to ſtriue againſt God.</p>
               <p n="16">16 <hi>But riſe.</hi> Chriſt did throw downe Paul that hee might humble him: now he lifteth him vp, and biddeth him be of good courage. And euen we are dayly thrown down by his voice to this end, that we may be taught to be modeſt: but looke whom he throweth downe, he doth raiſe the ſame againe gently. And this is no ſmall conſolation, when Chriſte ſaith that he appeared to him not as a reuenger to plague him for his madneſſe, for thoſe ſtripes which he had vniuſtly and cruelly giuen, for his blooddie ſentences, or for that trouble wherewith hee had troubled the Saints, for his wicked reſiſting of the Goſpell: but as a mercifull Lorde, intending to vſe his induſtrie, and to call hym to an honourable miniſtrie. For hee made him a witneſſe of thoſe thinges which he ſawe and which he ſhould afterwarde ſee. This viſion was worthie to bee recorded, by whiche hee learned that Chriſte reigneth in heauen, that he might no longer proudly contemne him: but acknowledge that he is the ſonne of God, and the promiſed redeemer, he had other reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations afterward,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 12.1.</note> as he ſaith in the ſecond Epiſtle to the Corinthians, and twelft chapter.</p>
               <p n="17">17 <hi>Deliuering thee,</hi> Hee is armed in this place againſt all feare, which was prepared for him: and alſo hee is prepared to beare the croſſe: Notwithſtanding ſeeing hee addeth immediately that Paule
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:7788:292" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſhoulde come to lighten the blinde, to reconcile thoſe to God which were eſtranged from him, and to reſtore ſaluation to thoſe which were loſt: it is a maruell why he doth not alſo promiſe, that they ſhall on the otherſide receiue him ioyfully, who ſhall by meanes of him receiue ſuch and ſo great benefites. But the vnthankfulneſſe of the worlde is noted out vnto vs in this place: becauſe the miniſters of eternall ſaluation are farre otherwiſe rewarded: as frantike men doe raile vppon their phiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And Paul is admoniſhed that whither ſoeuer he ſhall come, a great part of thoſe to whom he ſhall ſtudie to do good, ſhall hate him, &amp; ſeek his ouerthrow. And he ſaith plainely that hee is appointed to bee a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe both to Iewes &amp; Gentiles, leaſt that turne to his reproch, becauſe he made the Goſpell common to both alike. For the Iewes had concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued ſuche deadlie hatred againſt him for this cauſe, becauſe it greeued them that the Gentiles ſhould bee made their fellowes. And though they made a ſhew that this did proceed of zeale, becauſe they woulde not haue the couenant which God made with the poſteritie of Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> profaned, by beeing tranſlated vnto ſtraungers: yet meere ambition did pricke them forward, becauſe they alone would bee excellent, all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being vnderlings. But in the perſon of one man, all godlie teachers are encouraged to do their dutie, that they be not hindred or kept back with the malice of men from offering the grace of God vnto miſerable men though they be vnworthie.</p>
               <p n="18">18 <hi>That thou maieſt open their eyes.</hi> Paul in taking to himſelfe that which is proper to God, doeth ſeeme to exalt himſelfe too high. For we knowe that it is the holy Ghoſt alone which doth lighten the eyes. We know that Chriſt is the only redeemer which doth deliuer vs from the tyrannie of Satan. We know that it is God alone who hauing put away our ſinnes, doth adopt vs vnto the inheritance of the Saints. But this is a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon thing, that God doth tranſlate vnto his miniſters that honor which is due to himſelfe alone, not that hee may take any thing from himſelfe, but that hee may commend that mightie working of his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite which he doth ſhew foorth in them. For he doth not ſend them to worke, that they may bee dead inſtruments, or as it were ſtage players: but that hee may worke mightily by their hande. But it dependeth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the ſecrete power of his Spirite that their preaching is effectuall, who worketh all thinges in all men, and which onelie gyueth the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe.</p>
               <p>Therefore teachers are ſent, not to vtter their wordes in vaine in the ayre, or to beate the eares only with a vaine ſounde, but to bring liuely light to the blinde, to faſhion again mens hearts vnto the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of God, and to ratifie the grace of ſaluation whiche is gotten by the death of Chriſte. But they doe none of all theſe, ſaue one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie in as much as God worketh by them, that their labour may not bee in vaine, that all the prayſe may bee his, as the effect commeth from him.</p>
               <p>And therefore we muſt note, that ſo often as the ſcripture doeth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toll
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:7788:293" rendition="simple:additions"/> the externall miniſterie ſo honourably, we muſt not ſeparate it from the Spirite, which quickneth the ſame euen as the ſoule doth the body. For it teacheth in other places how little mans induſtrie can doe of it ſelfe. For they muſt plant and water: but it is God alone which giueth the encreaſe. But becauſe many are hindered by their owne ignorance &amp; malice, that they cannot reap ſuch frute of the Goſpel as they ought, wee muſt note this deſcription, which ſetteth before our eyes briefly &amp; plentifully, that incomparable treaſure. Therfore this is the drift of the Goſpel that beeing deliuered from blindneſſe of minde, wee may bee made partakers of the heauenly light: that beeing deliuered from the thraldome of Satan, we may be turned to God: that hauing free for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueneſſe of ſinnes, wee may be made partakers of the inheritaunce a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Saints. Thoſe which will rightly profite in the Goſpel muſte direct al their ſenſes to this end: for what good ſhal the continuall prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching thereof doe vs, if we know not the true vſe therof? Alſo the way and meanes to attaine to ſaluation is deſcribed to vs, All men boaſt that they be deſirous of ſaluation: but few conſider how God will ſaue them.</p>
               <p>Therfore this place wherin the means is pretily co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehended, is as it were a key to open the gate of heauen. Furthermore wee muſt knowe, that all mankinde is naturally depriued of thoſe good thinges, whiche Chriſt ſaith we haue by beleeuing his Goſpell. So that it followeth that al are blind, becauſe they be lightned by faith, that al are the bo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dſlaues of Sata<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, bicauſe they are ſet free by faith fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nie: that all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are the enemies of God and ſubiect to eternall death, becauſe they receiue remiſſion of ſinnes by faith. So that nothing is more miſerable then we if we be without Chriſt and without his faith. Whereby it appeareth how little, yea that nothing is left for the free will of mens merites. As touching euery part, this lightening is referred vnto the knowledge of God, becauſe all our quickneſſe of ſight is meere vanitie and thicke darkeneſſe, vntill hee appeare vnto vs by his truth. That reacheth farther which followeth afterwarde: To bee turned from darkneſſe to light. For that is when wee are renewed in the ſpirite of oure minde.</p>
               <p>Therefore in my iudgement this member and that which followeth expreſſe both one thing: to bee turned from the power of Satan vnto God. For that renewing which Paul declareth more largely in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond chapter to the Epheſians, is expreſſed in diuers formes of ſpeech. Remiſſion of ſins followeth next,<note place="margin">Ephe. 2.10. &amp; 4.23.</note> wherby God doth freely reconcile vs to himſelfe, ſo that we need not doubt but that god wil be fauourable &amp; mercifull to vs. At length the furniſhing and filling of all thinges is put in the laſt place: to wit, the inheritance of eternall life. Some doe reade it falſly in one text, Among thoſe who are ſanctified by faith: becauſe this woord is extended vnto the whole period. Therefore the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thereof is, that by faith wee come vnto the poſſeſſion of all thoſe good thinges which are offered by the goſpell. And faith is properlye
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:7788:293"/> directed vnto Chriſt: becauſe all the parts of our ſaluation are included in him. Neither doth the Goſpel commaund vs to ſeeke the ſame any where els ſaue only in him.</p>

Now it appeareth that there is nothing in the very ſumme of his doctrine which diſſenteth from the law and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes. Whereby the oracle doth winne greater credite, whereby Paul was commanded to teach nothing but that which was agreeable to the ſcripture. Conuerſion or turning vnto God is ioyned with repentance not as ſome peculiar thing: but that we may know what it is to repent. Like as alſo on the contrary the corruption of men and their frowarde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is nothing els but an eſtranging fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God.

Therefore their madneſſe doeth teſtifie that they are deſtitute of reaſon. Whereas Paule ſaieth that hee was ſaued by the helpe of God, it maketh for the confirmation of his doctrine.

And he ſaieth that hee is a witneſſe both to great and ſmall, that king Agrippa may perceiue that this doth appertaine euen to him: and that when the Goſpell is offered euen to euery ſimple man, that doeth no whit hinder but that it may aſcend euen vnto the throne of Princes. For Chriſt doth gather al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into his boſom with one &amp; the ſame im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing, that thoſe who lay before in the doung hill, and are now extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vnto ſo great honour, may reioyce in his free goodneſſe, and that thoſe who are placed in high degree of honour, may willingly humble themſelues, and not grudge to haue ſome of the baſe and contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble multitude for their brethren, that they may bee made the children of God. So in the firſt chapter to the Romanes, Hee ſaith that he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted both to the fooles and to the wiſe, leaſt the Romanes ſhould bee kept backe with the confidence which they might repoſe in their wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, from ſubmitting themſelues to his doctrine. By this let vs learne that it is not in the teachers wil to make choyſe of his hearers, and that they doe no leſſe doe iniurie to God then defraude men of their right, whoſoeuer they be which reſtraine their labour vnto great men, whom God doth ioyne with thoſe which are ſmall. It were too cold to reſtrain this vnto ages. Wherefore I doe not doubt but that Paule taketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the exception which vſeth to bee between the noble and vnnoble, becauſe he was neither afraide of the dignitie of the one, neither did he loath the baſeneſſe of the other, but did ſhew himſelf a faithfull teacher to both alike.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Saying no other thing.</hi> Firſt, this is woorth the noting, that Paul to the ende hee may bring in fit and ſubſtantiall witneſſes of his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, doeth not take the ſame from among men, but hee citeth Moſes and the Prophetes, to whome the Lorde had gtaunted vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted authoritie. And ſurely this is one principle to bee obſerued,
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:7788:294"/> when we wil teach ſoundly, to vtter nothing but that which did proceed out of the mouth of God. Secondly this is worth the noting, that theſe were the principall pointes of the diſputation, which Luke doeth nowe touch: that This was the proper office of Chriſt, by his death to make ſatisfaction for the ſinnes of the worlde, by his reſurrection to purchaſe righteouſneſſe and life for men: and that the fruite of his death and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection is common both to Iewes and Gentiles. But foraſmuch as there is no manifeſt, and (as they ſay) literall teſtimonie extant in the Lawe concerning the death and reſurrection of Chriſt: vndoubtedly they had ſome doctrin deliuered by hand from the Fathers, out of which they did learne to referre all figures vnto Chriſt. And as the Prophets, which did prophecie more plainly of Chriſt, had their doctrin from that fountaine, ſo they made the men of their time beleeue, that they deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered vnto them no new thing, or which did diſſent from Moſes. And now Paul did either not finiſh his apologie, or elſe he gathered more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident teſtimonies of all thoſe things, wherein he profeſſed Moſes and the Prophets to be his authours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The first of thoſe which.</hi> There were ſome other whoſe reſurrection went before Chriſts in time: namely if we admit that the ſaints of whom the Euangeliſts ſpeake, did come out of their graues before Chriſt:<note place="margin">Mat. 27.57 Gen. 5.24. 2. King. 2.11 1. Cor. 15.23.</note> which may likwiſe be ſaid of the taking vp of Enoch &amp; Elias. But he calleth him in this place the Firſt, as in another place the firſt fruits of thoſe which riſe again. Therefore this word doth rather note out the cauſe, than the order of time: becauſe whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt did riſe again, he became the conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of death &amp; Lord of life, that he might reigne for euer, &amp; make thoſe who are his, partakers of bleſſed immortalitie. Vnder this word light, he comprehendeth whatſoeuer doeth pertaine vnto perfite felicitie, as by darkneſſe is meant death and all manner of miſerie. And I do not doubt but that Paul alluded vnto the ſayings of the Prophetes,<note place="margin">Eſai. 9.2. Ibid. 60.2.</note> The people which walked in darkneſſe ſawe great light. And againe, Behold darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſhall couer the earth, and a myſt the people: but the Lord ſhall be ſeene vpon thee. Againe, Behold thoſe which are in darkneſſe ſhall ſee light. Againe, I haue made thee a light of the Gentiles.<note place="margin">Ibid. 42.16 &amp; 6. &amp; 49.6.</note> And it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by many oracles that the light of life ſhould come out of Iudea and ſhould be ſpread abroad among the Gentiles.</p>

               <p n="24">24 <hi>Festus ſaid with a lowd voice.</hi> This outcrie which Feſtus doth make, doth ſhewe how much the truth of God preuaileth with the reprobate: to wit, though it bee neuer ſo plaine and euident, yet is it troden vnder foote by their pride. For though thoſe things which Paul had alleaged out of the Lawe and Prophetes, had nothing in them which was any thing like to madneſſe, but were grounded in good reaſon, yet he doth attribute the ſame to madneſſe: not becauſe hee ſeeth any abſurditie, but becauſe hee refuſeth thoſe thinges which hee doeth not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande. Nothing was more fooliſh or more vnſauourie than the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions of the Gentiles, ſo that their high Prieſtes were for good cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes aſhamed to vtter their myſteries, whoſe follie was more than ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous.</p>
               <p>Feſtus doeth graunt that there was learning packed in Paules ſpeech, neuertheleſſe becauſe the Goſpell is hidden from the vnbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 4.3.</note> whoſe mindes Sathan hath blinded, hee thinketh that hee is a brainſicke fellowe which handleth matters intricarlie. So that though hee cannot mocke and openly contemne him, yet hee is ſo farre from being mooued or inwardly touched, that hee counteth him a man which is frenſie, and of madde curioſitie. And this is the cauſe that he cannot away to marke what hee ſaieth, leaſt hee make him madde alſo. As manie at this day flie from the worde of God, leaſt they drowne themſelues in a Labarinth: and they thinke that we be madde, becauſe wee mooue queſtions concerning hidden matters, and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come troubleſome both to our ſelues and alſo to others. Wherefore being admoniſhed by this example, let vs begge of God, that hee will ſhewe vs the light of his doctrine, and that he will therewithall giue vs a taſte thereof, leaſt through obſcuritie and hardneſſe it become vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſauourie, and at length proude loathſomneſſe breake out into blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie.</p>
               <p n="25">25 <hi>I am not madde.</hi> Paul is not angrie neither doeth hee ſharpely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehende Feſtus for his blaſphemous ſpeech: yea hee ſpeaketh vnto him with great ſubmiſſion. For it was no place for reprehenſion, and it became him to pardon the ignorance of the man, ſeing hee did not ſet himſelfe face to face againſt God. Alſo he had reſpect vnto his perſon. For though hee were vnworthie of honour, yet was hee in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie. And yet for all that hee doeth not therefore giue place to his
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:7788:295"/> blaſphemie, but hee defendeth the glorie of the word of God. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by wee doe alſo ſee, that not caring for himſelfe, hee did onelie take thought for his doctrine. For he doeth not vaunt of his wit, hee doeth not labour in defenſe of his wiſedome: but hee is content with this defenſe alone, that hee teacheth nothing but that which is true and ſober.</p>
               <p>Furthermore the truth is ſet againſt all manner fallacies and fraud: ſobrietie againſt all manner friuolous ſpeculations, and thornie ſubtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which are onely ſeeds of contention. Paul doeth in deede refute Feſtus his errour: yet wee may gather by this which is the beſt manner of teaching, to wit, that which is not onely cleane from all fallicies and deceit, but alſo doth not make the mindes of men drunken with vaine queſtions, and doth not nouriſh fooliſh curioſitie, nor an intemperate deſire to know more than is meete: but is moderate and good for ſound edification.</p>
               <p n="26">26 <hi>For the King knoweth of theſe th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And firſt hee ſaieth that hee knewe the hyſtorie of the thinges: but hee calleth him ſtreightway backe to the Lawe and the Prophetes. For it was to ſmall end for him to knowe the thing which was done, vnleſſe hee did knowe that thoſe thinges which had beene ſpoken before of Chriſt, were fulfilled in the perſon of Ieſus which was crucified. And whereas Paule doeth not doubt of Agrippa his faith, hee doeth it not ſo much to praiſe him, as that hee may put the Scripture out of all queſtion, leaſt hee be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to ſtande vppon the verie principles. Therefore his meaning is that the Scripture is of ſufficient credite of it ſelfe, ſo that it is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for a man that is a Iewe to diminiſh any iot of the authoritie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. And yet Paule doeth not flatter him: for though hee did not reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence the Scripture as became a godly man: yet he had this rudiment from his childhoode, that hee was perſwaded that nothing is contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned therein beſides the Oracles of God. As the common ſort of men, though they do not greatly care for the word of God: yet they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and confeſſe generally and confuſedly that it is the word of God, ſo that they are letted with ſome reuerence either to reiect or to deſpiſe the ſame.</p>
               <p n="28">28 <hi>And Agrippa ſaide vnto Paule.</hi> The Apoſtle preuailed thus farre at leaſt, that hee wronge out of king Agrippa a confeſſion though it were not voluntarie: as thoſe vſe to yeelde, who can no longer reſiſt the trueth, or at leaſt to ſhewe ſome token of aſſent. Agrippa his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is that hee will not willingly become a Chriſtian, yea that he will not bee one at all: and yet that hee is not able to gaineſay, but that he is drawne after a ſort againſt his wil. Wherby it appeareth how great the pride of mans nature is, vntill it bee brought vnder to obey by the Spirit of God. Interpreters expound this <hi>en olige</hi> diuerſly. Valla thought that it ought to be tranſlated thus, Thou doſt almoſt make me a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian. Eraſmus doth tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſlate it, a litle. The old interpreter dealeth more
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:7788:296" rendition="simple:additions"/> plainely, in a little. Becauſe tranſlating it word for word, he left it to the readers to iudge at their pleaſure. And ſurely it may fitly be referred vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the time, as if Agrippa had ſaid, Thou wilt make me a Chriſtian ſtreight way, or in one moment. If any man obiect that Paules anſwere doth not agree thereto, we may quickly anſwere: For ſeeing the ſpeech was doubtfull: Paul doth fitly apply that vnto the thing, which was ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the time. Therefore ſeing Agrippa did meane that he was almoſt made a Chriſtian in a ſmall time: Paul addeth that he doth deſire that as wel he, as his companions might riſe from ſmall beginnings, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite more and more: and yet I doe not miſlike that, that <hi>en oligo</hi> doth ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie as much as almoſt. This anſwere doeth teſtifie with what zeale to ſpread abroad the glory of Chriſt, this holy mans breaſt was enflamed, when as hee doeth patiently ſuffer thoſe bounds wherewith the Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour had bound him, and doth deſire that hee might eſcape the deadly ſnares of Satan, &amp; to haue both him &amp; alſo his partners to be partakers with him of the ſame grace, being in the meane ſeaſon content with his troubleſome and reprochfull condition. We muſt note that he doth not wiſh it ſimplie: but from God, as it is he which draweth vs vnto his ſon: becauſe vnleſſe he teach vs inwardly by his Spirit, the outward doctrine ſhall alwayes wax cold.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 6.17.</note>
                  <hi>Except theſe bonds.</hi> It is certaine that Paul his bonds were not ſo hard, no yet did they cauſe him ſuch ſorrowe, wherein hee did oftentimes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce, &amp; which he doth mention for honours ſake, as being the badge of his ambaſſage: but hee hath reſpect to thoſe to whom hee wiſheth faith without trouble or croſſe. For thoſe who did not as yet beleue in Chriſt, were farre from that affection, to be readie to ſtriue for the Goſpel. And ſurely it behooueth all the godly to haue this gentleneſſe and meeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that they patiently beare their owne croſſe: and that they wiſh well to others, and ſtudie ſo much as in them lieth to eaſe them of all trouble, and that they doe in no caſe enuie their quietneſſe and myrth. This courteſie is farre contrarie to the bitterneſſe of thoſe, who take comfort in wiſhing that other men were in their miſerie.</p>
               <p n="31">31 <hi>They ſpake togither.</hi> In that Paul is acquitted by the iudgement of them all, it turned to the great renowne of the Goſpel. And when Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus agreeth to the reſt he condemneth himſelfe: ſeing he had brought Paul into ſuch ſtraites through his vniuſt dealing, by bringing him in daunger of his life vnder colour of chaunging the place. And though it ſeemeth that the appeale did hinder the holy man: yet becauſe this was the onely way to eſcape death, he is content, and doth not ſeeke to get out of that ſnare: not onely becauſe the matter was not euen nowe ſafe and ſound,<note place="margin">Sup. 23.11.</note> but becauſe hee was admoniſhed in the viſion that hee was alſo called by God to Rome.</p>

               </q>
               <p n="9">9 <hi>When ſailing was nowe ieoperdous.</hi> He doth not onely meane that the windes were contrary then, but alſo that the time of the yeare was not then commodious, which hee expreſſeth more plainely afterwarde, when he ſaith that the faſt was paſſed: for I thinke that this worde was added by way of expoſition, to note the end of harueſt. Neither doe I paſſe for that, that that ſolemne time of faſting whereof Luke ſpeaketh, was ſtraunge to the Centurion and the reſt of the mariners: for hee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth out the times of the yeare according to the cuſtome of the Iewes. Furthermore wee neede not doubt but that it was the harueſt faſt. Though I am not of their minde, who thinke that it was one of the fower faſtes which the Iewes did appoint after the carrying away into Babylon. For Luke woulde not haue put downe ſimplie without ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding any diſtinction, the thirde faſt which was in the ſeuenth moneth, ſeeing it was not more famous than the reſt, being commaunded to bee kept becauſe of the death of Godolia, and becauſe of the deſtruction of the reſt of the people. Againe, I cannot tell whether that cuſtome were retained by the people after their returne it is more likely that he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the feaſt of the attonement, wherein the Lord commanded them to humble their ſoules ſeuen dayes. And they beganne the tenth day of the ſeuenth moneth:<note place="margin">Leu. 16.25.</note> whereto partly September and partly October doth now agree. Therefore ſeing they were nowe entered into Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, it is ſaide not without cauſe, that ſailing was ieoperdous at that time. But and if you referre it vnto hunger (as ſome doe) I doe not ſee what ſenſe can bee gathered thence: for they had as yet ſtore of wheat in the ſhippe, ſo that they needed not to bee hunger ſterued. And why ſhoulde hee ſay that the time of the voluntarie faſt was paſſed? More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer it ſhall hereafter appeare by the text, that they were therefore exhorted by Paul to ſtay, becauſe winter was at hand, whoſe ſharpenes vſeth to ſhut vp the ſeas. For though he were aſſured that God woulde gouern the ſhip, yet he would not tempt him raſhly by making too great haſte.</p>
               <p n="11">11 <hi>But the Centurion.</hi> The Centurion is not reproued becauſe hee harkned rather to the maſter and gouernour of the ſhippe than to Paul. For what ſhould he haue done? For though hee did well like Paule his counſell in other matters, yet hee knew that hee was vnskilfull in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. Therefore he ſuffered himſelfe to be gouerned by thoſe which were expert, which was a point of a wiſe and modeſt man. Yea verie neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie did almoſt compel him to doe this: for the hauen was not commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to Winter in. Neither did the Gouernour giue counſell to commit
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:7788:298"/> the ſhippe to the maine ſea; but to thruſt in into the next hauen, which was almoſt in view. So that with taking a little paines they might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiouſly paſſe the winter. Luke reciteth this not in vaine: but that we may know that Paul was from the beginning furniſhed with the ſenſe of the Spirit, ſo that he did better ſee what things were profitable than did the maſters. We know not whether he were taught by Oracles, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he gaue this counſell through ſecreat inſpiration. This is certaine, that it ſerued afterward to his commendation. Furthermore in that he ſaith that they ſailed beyond the coaſt of Candie, vntil they were caught and carried away, our friend Beza doth iuſtly reproue the errour of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters in this worde <hi>aſſon,</hi> who make of an aduerbe the name of a Citie.</p>
               <p n="15">15 <hi>When the ſhippe was caught.</hi> Luke ſaieth that that fell out heere, which vſeth to fall out in extreame danger: namely, they ſuffered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to be carried of the winds. Seing they were firſt gone ſome ſpace, and the marriners thought that all things fel out as they would haue it, vndoubtedly they did deride Paul his admonition: as raſh men vſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly to wax proud, if fortune fauour them. Being now caught, they are grieuouſly puniſhed for their boldneſſe: yea when they drewe neere to an hauen, they were no leſſe affraid leaſt they ſhould breake the ſhippe, then they were before of ouerturning the ſame. Luke doeth diligentlie note all theſe things, out of which we may gather, that the ſtorme was ſo vehement and fierce, and that it continued ſtill at one ſtay, that they were ſtill in daunger of death. Alſo he declareth that they did couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly vſe all remedies, which might ſaue them from ſuffering ſhipwrack, and that they ſpared not the marchandize and tackling: whence we ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that they were enforced with a liuely feeling of danger, to do what they were able. And Luke addeth that when they had aſſaied all things, they deſpaired of their ſafetie. And ſurely the very darkneſſe of heauen was as it were a graue. Neither need we doubt but that the Lord meant by this meanes to commend and make more notable the grace of their deliuerance which inſued ſhortly after. Neuertheleſſe hee ſuffered his ſeruant to labour with the reſt, vntill he thought he ſhould die. For hee did not appeare vnto him by his Angell, before it might ſeeme that hee was paſt hope of recouery. Wherefore his bodie was not onely toſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt many ſtormes: but his ſoule was alſo ſhaken with violent tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Notwithſtanding the end doth ſhew that he ſtood vpright by faith, ſo that he did not faint. Luk ſpeaketh nothing of his praiers: but bicauſe he himſelfe ſaith afterward that the Angel of God, whom he ſerued, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to him, it is likely that when others did curſſe both heauen and earth, he made his praiers to God, and ſo was quiet, and did patientlie tarrie the Lords leiſure. And whereas he ſaith that al hope of ſafety was taken away: it muſt not bee referred vnto his ſenſe, but onely vnto the meanes which men coulde vſe: as if hee ſhoulde ſay, that thinges were ſo farre out of order, that there was no ſafetie to be looked for at mens hands.</p>

               <p n="21">21 <hi>After long abſtinence.</hi> Though Luke doeth not plainely expreſſe how the mariners and ſoldiars behaued themſelues, yet he doth plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtinguiſh Paul from them, declaring that hee ſtoode in the midſt of them, that he might comfort their faint hearts: for no man is fit to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort but hee who is himſelfe an example of conſtancie and fortitude. Furthermore Paul deferred this exhortation, vntill they were all euen at the laſt caſt. Wee may eaſily gather out of the common cuſtome of the infidels, that they raged and made much adoe at the firſt. A mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and ſoft voice coulde neuer haue beene heard amongſt thoſe cries and tumults. Nowe after they bee wearie with working and howling, they ſit ſtil al in a dampe, and Paul beginneth to ſpeake to them. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was meete that they ſhould languiſh like men halfe deade, vntill they were ſomewhat quiet, and coulde heare a man which woulde giue them good counſell. Notwithſtanding Paul ſeemeth to deale vnſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nablie when as he obiecteth to them fooliſhneſſe, becauſe they woulde not doe after his counſell, when all was well, ſeing that they knew that hee was vnexpert in ſailing, as hee himſelfe alſo knewe howe vnskilfull and ignorant he was.</p>
               <pb n="578" facs="tcp:7788:299"/>
               <p>But if we conſider what an hard matter it is to bring men vnto ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of minde, this reprehenſion was verie profitable. Pauls authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ſhoulde haue beene nothing worth, neither ſhoulde it haue moued them any whit, vnleſſe they ſhoulde knowe this, that it had not gone well with them becauſe they had deſpiſed him before. Chiding is in deede cruell and bringeth no comfort: but if it be tempered with ſome remedie, it is nowe a part of the medicine. So, after that Paule had made the marriners attentiue, and had taught by the verie euent th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> they ought to beleeue him, hee exhorteth them to bee of good cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and promiſeth them ſafetie. And this is a token of no ſmal bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, when hee ſaieth that they ought to haue obeyed him. Therefore hee teſtifieth by theſe wordes, that hee ſpake nothing vnaduiſedly: but did commaunde them to doe that which God had preſcribed. For though wee doe not reede that hee had ſome eſpeciall reuelation then giuen him: yet hee himſelfe knewe that the ſpirite did ſecreatly go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne him: ſo that hee might without feare take vppon him to giue counſell, ſeeing hee had the Spirite of God to be his guide. Whereby that doeth better appeare which I touched of late, that Paul in ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king thus doeth awake the marriners, that they may more attentiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie heare what hee will ſay. Otherwiſe it had beene a ridiculous thing for a man which was in daunger of drowning, to promiſe ſafetie to thoſe who were partakers with him in like calamitie.</p>
               <p n="23">23 <hi>For there ſtoode by mee.</hi> Leaſt hee might bee accuſed of raſhneſſe, for promiſing ſo fully that they ſhoulde bee all ſafe, hee bringeth in God for his authour and witneſſe. Neither is it to be doubted but that hee was fullie perſwaded that it was a true viſion, ſo that hee did not feare Sathans iuglings. For becauſe that father of lies doeth often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times deceiue men vnder a colour of reuelations, God did neuer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to his ſeruauntes, either by himſelfe or by his Angels, but hee put them out of doubt by ſhewing them ſome plaine and euident to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens: and ſecondly did furniſh them with the Spirit of deſcretion that they might not bee deceiued. But Paule doeth extoll the name of his God in plaine wordes among prophane men: not onely that they may learne that the true God is worſhipped in Iudea, but alſo that Paul himſelfe doth worſhip him. They all knew why hee was put in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Now ſeing Angels come downe vnto him from heauen, they may eaſily gather, that his cauſe is approued of God. Therefore there is in theſe wordes a ſecreat commendation of the Goſpell. Neuertheleſſe wee ſee how Paul triumpheth in his bonds, when hee is the miniſter of ſafetie to ſo manie men, and the interpreter of God.</p>
               <p n="24">24 <hi>Feare not Paule.</hi> Hee is verie deſirous to bring to paſſe that they may giue God alone the praiſe for their deliuerance: leaſt theſe ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious men doe falſely tranſlate it vnto their idols: and by this meanes hee inuiteth them vnto the true faith. But by this it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth howe great the mens wickedneſſe is, in that they ſhut their eares againſt ſounde and wholſome counſell, and doe forthwith forgette the
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:7788:299"/> grace of God though it were familiarly knowne to them. Yea (that which worſe is) they doe not ſee nor perceiue it when it is preſent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their eies. But howſoeuer the more parte was vnthankefull: yet this Oracle was not reuealed without fruite: yea this was good, that thoſe might bee made without excuſe, who did flatter themſelues too much in their deceipte. And ſeeing it was ſaide that hee muſt bee preſented before Ceſar, it tended to this ende, that his confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on might the more ſtrengthen the godlie, when as they ſhoulde knowe that hee came foorth from God as a witneſſe to confirme and auouche the doctrine of the Goſpel, and that hee was appointed and ſaued to that end.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hath giuen thee all the ſoules.</hi> Luke ſeemeth to giue vs to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande by theſe wordes, that Paule prayed not onelie for himſelfe, but alſo for the reſt, that God woulde ſaue them all from drowning. And ſurelie it is likelie that ſeeing hee ſawe the daunger common to them all, hee was not ſo carefull for his owne life, that hee cared not for the reſt, whom hee ſawe in like daunger. Notwithſtanding it may bee that the Lorde did of his owne accorde preuent his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Neither is it any newe thing, that his bleſſing ſhoulde reach euen vnto the vnworthie, who are ioyned to the faithfull with any ſocietie. So hee woulde haue ſaued Sodome if there had beene tenne good men founde there. Heere ariſeth a queſtion, howe farre the integritie of the ſaints doth profite the wicked.</p>
               <p>Firſt wee muſt remoue the ſuperſtition of the Papiſtes, who when they heare that God is good to the badde for the goods ſake, dreame that they bee mediatours, who obtaine ſaluation for the worlde through their merites. And they bee twiſe fooles in that, that they applie theſe titles of the lyuing vnto the deade: and thinke that God will bee fauourable to them for no other cauſe, ſaue onelie becauſe he beholdeth them, and therefore they make them their patrons. I omit that, that by extolling mens merites they darken the free goodneſſe of God. Nowe that wee may aunſwere the queſtion propounded, wee muſt briefely note this: that for as much as the good are mixed with the badde, as well proſperitie as aduerſitie doeth happen as well to the one as to the other: and yet it falleth out ſometimes that when the Lorde doeth ſpare his, he beareth alſo with the wicked for a time togither with them. Againe that there bee manie cauſes, for which God doeth good to the wicked and reprobate for the faithfuls ſake. Hee bleſſed the houſe of Putiphar for Ioſephs ſake, that hee might mooue him to handle this holy man gentlie.<note place="margin">Gen. 39.5.</note> Hee declared his good will towarde Paule in ſauing manie men, that he might beare witneſſe of his godlineſſe, that the maieſtie of the Goſpell might thereby ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare more plainely. But we muſt note this, that whatſoeuer benefits God beſtoweth vppon the wicked, they turne at length to their deſtruction: as on the other ſide puniſhmentes are profitable for the godlie, which they ſuffer togither with the reprobate.</p>
               <pb n="580" facs="tcp:7788:300"/>
               <p>In the meane ſeaſon this is a ſingular pledge of Gods loue toward vs, in that he maketh certaine droppes of his goodneſſe diſtil from vs vnto others.</p>
               <p n="25">25 <hi>For I beleeue God.</hi> Paul telleth them againe, whence hee had ſuch boldnes, that he affirmeth that though they be amidſt infinite gulfes of the ſea, yet ſhall they all come ſafe to the hauen: namely, becauſe God had promiſed it ſhuld be ſo: in which words the nature of faith is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, when there is a mutuall relation made betweene it and the worde of God, that it may ſtrengthen mens minds againſt the aſſalts of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. And he doth not only exhort the mariners by his own example to beleue: but doth as it were take vpon him the office of a promiſer, that he may winne credite to the Oracle. That which followeth immediatly touching the Ile, is a latter ſigne: whereby it may more plainly appeare after the ende of the matter, that this their ſailing was not vncertaine: otherwiſe it had bin to no end for the mariners to know how they ſhould eſcape. Therefore we ſee how God doth giue that ſafetie which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, a marke, that it may not ſeeme to come by chance. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding wee muſt note that God kept them ſtill in ſome doubt: partly that he may exerciſe the faith of his ſeruant, partly that they may all knowe that Paul learned that of the holy Ghoſt, which hee could not as yet comprehend by mans reaſon. Notwithſtanding Luke teacheth in the text it ſelfe, that he was not beleeued for al this. For ſeing the mariners thought that there began ſome countrie to appeare vnto them, it did not agree with the promiſe made touching their arriuing in an Ile. Therefore wee ſee howe that they were ſcarce enforced euen by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to thinke that he ſpake the truth.</p>
               <p n="30">30 <hi>And as the mariners ſought.</hi> The grace of the holie ſpirit appeareth in Paul euen in this point alſo, in that he did wiſely admoniſh that the mariners ſhoulde not bee ſuffered to flie. For why doeth not rather the Centurion or ſome other of the companie ſmell out their fraude, ſaue onely that Paul may be the miniſter of their deliuerance euen vnto the end? But it is a maruel that he ſaith that the reſt could not be ſaued vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the mariners ſhoulde remaine in the ſhippe. As if it were in their power to make the promiſe of God of none effect. I aunſwere that Paul doeth not diſpute in this place preciſely of the power of God, that hee may ſeperate the ſame from his will and from meanes: and ſurely God doth not therefore commend his power to the faithfull, that they may giue themſelues to ſluggiſhneſſe and careleſneſſe, contemning meanes, or raſhly caſt away themſelues when there is ſome certaine way to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape. God did promiſe Ezechias that the citie ſhoulde be deliuered. If he had ſet open the gates to the enimie: would not Ieſaias ſtraightway haue cried,<note place="margin">Iſai. 37.6. &amp; 35.</note> thou deſtroyeſt both thy ſelfe and the Cittie? And yet for all this it doeth not followe, that the hande of God is tied to meanes or helpes: but when God appointeth this or that meanes to bring anie thing to paſſe, hee holdeth all mans ſenſes, that they may not paſſe the bounds which he hath appointed.</p>

               <p n="33">33 <hi>And when the day began.</hi> Whatſoeuer the marriners thinke, Paule his faith doth not quaile: but he leaneth ſtedfaſtly to the promiſe which was made to him. For he doth not onely exhort them to take meate, as did he who in extreme diſpaire vttered theſe words, Dine ſoldiars wee ſhall ſuppe in Hell: but continuing ſtedfaſt in his prophecie, he willeth them to be of good courage. The force of faith doth therein ſhew it ſelf, when as it armeth vs vnto patience, and doeth valiantly beare off and beate backe thoſe aſſaultes wherewith Sathan goeth about to ſhake it. But whereas he ſaith that they continued faſting for the ſpace of four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene dayes, it may ſeeme abſurde and falſe. There may ſome one man bee founde, which can abide to faſt long: but it is ſcarſe credible of ſo great a multitude. We may eaſily anſwere, that Their vnwonted abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence from meate is vnproperly called faſting: becauſe they had neuer filled their bellie during all that time: becauſe thoſe who are in ſorrowe and heauineſſe doe almoſt loath meate. And becauſe diſpaire was the cauſe of this their loathing of meate, he affirmeth againe that they ſhal liue, ſo they bee of good courage. For a faithfull miniſter of the worde muſt not onely bring abroade the promiſes: but alſo counſell men to followe God whither ſoeuer hee calleth them: and that they bee not
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:7788:301"/> ſlothfull and ſluggiſh. Furthermore the meaning of the wordes is this, God hath determined to ſaue you, this confidence ought to animate you, and to make you merie, that you bee not negligent in your owne buſineſſe.</p>
               <p n="35">35 <hi>He tooke bread.</hi> That hee may the better encourage them by his owne example, hee taketh breade and eateth. Luke ſaith that hee gaue thankes, not onely according to his daily cuſtome, but becauſe that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued greatly to teſtifie his boldneſſe and good confidence. It is not to be doubted but that Paul himſelfe did that when he tooke meate, which he commaundeth other men: but nowe hee doeth not onely teſtifie his thankfulneſſe, neither doth he onely deſire of God that he will ſanctifie the meate which he is about to eat: but he calleth vppon God without feare who is the authour of his life, that thoſe poore wretches which were drenched in ſorrow might conceiue ſome good hope. And he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed thus farre at leaſt, that they gathered ſo much courage to them as to take meate: who had through feare forgotten to care for their life.</p>
               <p n="37">37 <hi>All the ſoules.</hi> The number of the men is recited firſt; that it may more plainely appeare that none of the multitude did periſh. For Luke doth not ſhew how many men did ſwimme to the ſhoare, but how many were then in the ſhippe. Secondly that the miracle may bee made more euident and alſo famous: for in mans iudgement it is a thing vnpoſſible that two hundred threeſcore and ſixteene men ſhould ſcape to land ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſuffered ſhipwracke, without loſſe of any mans life. For it is likelie that fewe had any skill in ſwimming, except the mariners. And though they were ſomewhat refreſhed with the meat which they had eaten: yet they were brought ſo lowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with ſorrowe and weariſomneſſe, that it is a maruel that they were ſo nimble as that they coulde moue their armes. And nowe wee muſt conſider what a ſturre they kept: whereas it is ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ſeene that twentie or thirty men do ſo ſwimme in danger, but one of them doeth hinder or drowne another. Therefore God did plainelie ſtretch forth his hand out of heauen, ſeing all thoſe came to ſhoare ſafe and ſound, which had caſt themſelues into the ſea.</p>
               <p n="38">38 <hi>And when they had eaten inough.</hi> This circumſtance doth ſhew that they were at length moued with Pauls words. It was not yet light, that they coulde knowe whether there were any hauen neere. And yet they caſt out into the ſea the wheat which remained, that they might ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the ſhippe. They would not haue done this vnleſſe Paul his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie had preuailed more with them nowe than before. But as all vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers are vnſtable, that perſwaſion did quickly vaniſh out of their minds.</p>
               <p n="41">41 <hi>They thrust in the ſhippe.</hi> And then it might ſeeme that both God had mocked Paul, and that he with trifling had brought his partners in a vaine hope, but God did forthwith put away that errour by giuing them proſperous ſucceſſe? It was meet that when the ſhip was broken, they ſhould be ſo diſcouraged, and that their ſoules ſhould ſo melt, that deſpaire might increaſe the glorie of the miracle. For God vſeth to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:7788:301"/> and gouerne his works ſo, that he maketh ſome ſhew of difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, by reaſon of many lets which fall out. By this meanes he ſharpneth our ſenſes vnto greater attentiueneſſe, that we may at length learn that though all the worlde ſtriue againſt him, yet will hee haue the victorie. This is the reaſon why he had leiffer draw Paul and his companions to the ſhore after that the ſhippe was loſt, than bring the ſhippe whole to land.</p>
               <p n="42">42 <hi>The counſell of the ſoldiars.</hi> This was too horrible vnthankfulneſſe. Though the ſoldiars might thanke Paule twiſe or thriſe for their liues, yet are they minded to kill him, for whoſe ſake they ought to haue ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the reſt. Hee had ſaued them euen as an Angel of God: hee had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen them wholſome counſell: hee had refreſhed them in the ſame day when they were paſt hope: and nowe they ſticke not to ſeeke to deſtroy him, by whom they were ſo often and ſo many wayes deliuered. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if it ſo fall out that we bee ill rewarded for our good deeds, there is no cauſe why the vnthankfulneſſe of men ſhoulde trouble vs, which is a diſeaſe too common. But they are not onely vnthankfull to Paule who was the miniſter of their life, but alſo their filthie misbeliefe and forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of the goodneſſe of God doth bewray it ſelfe. They had of late receiued that oracle, that their ſoules were giuen to Paul: and now ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they will be ſaued after he is dead, what other thing goe they about but to reſiſt God, that they may ſaue themſelues from death contrarie to his will? Therefore they haue nowe forgotten that grace whereof they taſted againſt their will in extreme diſpaire: neither doth it taſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny longer, after that they ſee the hauen nigh at hand. But it behooueth vs to conſider the wonderfull counſell of God as well in ſauing Paul as in fulfilling his promiſe: when as he bringeth thoſe men to land, who did what they could to make his promiſe of none effect. Thus doth his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe oftentimes ſtriue with the wickedneſſe of men. Yet hee doeth ſo pittie the wicked, that deferring their puniſhment vntill ſo fit opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, he doth not quite diſcharge them: yea the longer he tarrieth the more grieuouſly he puniſheth, &amp; ſo by that meanes he maketh amends for his long tarrying.</p>

               </q>
               <p n="1">1 That dolefull ſpectacle is deſcribed in the beginning of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when ſo many men being wet, and alſo all berayed with the ſome &amp; filth of the ſea, and ſtiffe with colde, did with much adoe crawle to the ſhore, for that was all one as if they had beene caſt vp by the ſea, to die ſome other death. After that, Luke declareth that they were courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly intertained of the Barbarians, that they kindled a fire that they might drie their cloathes, and refreſh their ioynts which were ſtiffe with colde, and at length that they were ſaued from the ſhowre. Therefore in that Paul commendeth theſe dueties, he ſheweth his thankfulneſſe: and ſo great liberalitie toward ſtrangers is for good cauſes aduaunced, whereof there be rare examples in the world. And though common na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth wring out of the barbarous Gentiles ſome affection of mercy in ſo great neceſſitie: yet vndoubtedly it was God which cauſed the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Melita to handle theſe men ſo courteouſly, that his promiſe might be ſure and certaine, which might ſeeme vnperfect, if the ſhipwracke had cauſed the loſſe of any mans life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Viper comming out of the heat.</hi> The very euent did proue that Paule was a true and vndoubted prophet of God. Nowe that God may make him famous as well by land as by ſea, hee ſealeth the former myracles with a newe myracle: and ſo hee ratifieth his Apoſtleſhippe among the men of Melita. And though there were not many which did profite thereby: yet the maieſtie of the Goſpell did ſhine euen among the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeuers: alſo this did greatly confirme the Oracles to the mariners, which they had not ſufficiently reuerenced. Neither did the viper come out of the ſtickes by chance: but the Lorde did direct her by his ſecreat counſell to bite Paul, becauſe he ſaw it would turne to the glorie of his Goſpel.</p>
               <p n="4">4 <hi>So ſoone as the Barbarians ſaw.</hi> This iudgement was common in all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, that Thoſe who were grieuouſly puniſhed, had grieuouſly offended. Neither was this perſwaſion conceiued of nothing: but it came rather from a true feeling of godlineſſe. For God, to the ende hee might make the world without excuſe, would haue this deepely rooted in the minds of all men, that calamitie and aduerſitie, and chiefely notable deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction were teſtimonies and ſignes of his wrath, and iuſt vengeance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſinnes. Therefore ſo often as wee call to minde any notable ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamitie, wee doe alſo remember that God is ſoare offended, ſeeing hee puniſheth ſo ſharpely. Neither did vngodlineſſe euer get the vpper hande ſo farre, but that all men did ſtill retaine this principle: that God, to the end hee may ſhowe himſelfe to be the iudge of the worlde, doeth notably puniſh the wicked. But heere crept in an errour almoſt alwaies, becauſe they condemned all thoſe of wickedneſſe, whom they ſaw roughly handeled. Though God doeth alwayes puniſhe mens ſinnes with aduerſitie: yet doth he not puniſh euery man according to
<pb n="585" facs="tcp:7788:302"/> his deſertes in this life, and ſometimes the puniſhmentes of the godlie are not ſo much puniſhments as tryals of their faith, and exerciſes of godlineſſe. Therfore thoſe men are deceiued, who make this a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall rule to iudge euery man according to his proſperitie or aduerſitie. This was the ſtate of the controuerſie between Iob and his friends:<note place="margin">Iab. 4.7.</note> they did affirme that that man was a reprobate and hated of God, whome God did puniſh, and he did alleage on the other ſide, that the godly are ſometimes humbled with the croſſe. Wherefore, leaſt we be deceiued in this point, we muſt beware of two things. The former is, that wee giue not raſh &amp; blind iudgement of things vnknown, according to the euenr alone: for becauſe God doth puniſh the good aſwell as the bad: yea it falleth out ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times that he ſpareth the reprobate, &amp; doth ſharplie pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh thoſe who are his: if we wil iudge aright, we muſt begin at another thing then at puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts: to wit, that we enquire after the life &amp; deeds, if any adulterer, if any blaſphemous perſon, if any periured man, or mur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>therer, if any filthie perſon, if any coſiner, if any blooddie beaſt be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. God doth point out his iudgement as it were with his finger. If we ſee no wickednes, nothing is better then to ſuſpend our iudgement co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning puniſhment The other caution is, that we wait for the end. For ſo ſoone as God beginneth to ſtrike, we doe not by and by ſee his drifte and purpoſe: but the vnlike end doth at length declare, that thoſe differ farre before God, who ſeeme in mens eyes both alike in the likelyhood of puniſhment. If any man obiect that it is not in vaine ſo often repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the lawe, that all priuate and publike miſeries are the ſcourges of God: I graunt in deede that that is true: but yet I denie that it doeth keepe God from ſparing whom he will for a time, though they be of all men the worſt, and from puniſhing thoſe more ſharplye, whoſe fault is meane. Neuertheleſſe it is not our duetie, to make that perpetuall which falleth out oftentimes. Wee ſee now wherein the men of Melite wer deceiued: to wit, becauſe hauing not ſcanned Pauls life, they iudge him to be a wicked man, only becauſe the viper doth bite him. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe they ſtay not the ende, but giue iudgemente raſhly. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe we muſt note that theſe are deteſtable monſters, who go about to plucke out of their heartes all feeling of Gods iudgement, which is ingraffed in vs all naturally, and which is alſo found in the Barbarians, and ſauage men. Whereas they think that Paul is rather giltie of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then of any other offence, they follow this reaſon, becauſe murther hath alwayes been moſt deteſtable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vengeance doth not ſuffer.</hi> They gather that he is a wicked man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe vengeance doth perſecute him though he haue eſcaped the Sea And they feined that the reuenging Goddeſſe did ſit by the ſeat of Iupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which they commonly called <hi>Dice:</hi> groſly, I graunt, as men ignorant of pure religion: and yet not without ſome tollerable ſignification, as if they had painted out God to be iudge of the world. But by theſe words the wrath of God is diſtinguiſhed from fortune: and ſo the iudgement of God is auouched againſt all blind chances. For the men of Melita take
<pb n="586" facs="tcp:7788:303" rendition="simple:additions"/> it to be a ſigne of the heauenly vengeance, in that though Paul be ſaued yet can he non be ſafe.</p>
               <p n="5">5 <hi>Shaking off the viper.</hi> The ſhaking off of the viper is a token of a quiet minde. For we ſee how greatly feare doth trouble and weaken me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: and yet you muſt not thinke that Paul was altogether void of feare. For faith doth not make vs blockiſh as brainſick men do imagine, when they be out of danger. But though faith doth not quite take away the feeling of euils, yet it doth temperate the ſame, leaſt the godly be more afraide then is meet: that they may alwayes be bold and haue a good hope. So though Paul vnderſtand that the viper was a noyſome beaſt, yet did he truſt to the promiſe which was made to him, and did not ſo feare her plaguie biting that it did trouble him: Becauſe hee was euen readie to die if need had been.</p>
               <p n="7">7 <hi>Changing their mindes they ſaid.</hi> This ſo wonderfull and ſodaine a chaunge, ought to haue inwardly touched the men of Melita, and to haue moued them to giue the glory to the mercy of god, as they did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to vengeance. But as mans reaſon is alwayes carried amiſſe vnto extremities, they make Paul at a ſodaine a God, whom they tooke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be a wicked murtherer. But if he could not choſe but be the one, it had been better for him to be counted a murtherer then a God. And ſurely Paul would rather haue wiſhed to be condemned not only of one crime, but alſo to haue ſuſteined all ſhame, and to haue beene thruſt downe into the deepe pit of hell, then to take to him ſelfe the glorie of God: which thing thoſe knewe full well who had hearde him preach a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt the ſtormes. Notwithſtanding it may be that being taught after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde, they did confeſſe that God was the authour of the myracle. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, let vs learne by this hiſtorie with patient and quiet minds to wait for the proſperous euent of things, which ſeeme at the firſt to tend toward the robbing of God of his honour. Which of vs would not haue been terrified with this ſpectacle, which did arme the wicked to ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with all manner of ſlaunderous ſpeeches the glory of the Goſpel? Yet we ſee how God did in good time preuent this inconuenience: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let vs not doubt but that after he hath ſuffered his to bee darkened with clowdes of ſlaunders, hee will ſend: remedie in his good time, and will turne their darkneſſe into light. In the meane ſeaſon let vs remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that we muſt beware of the iudgement of the fleſh. And becauſe men doe alwayes forget themſelues, let vs beg of God the ſpirit of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, that he may keepe vs alway in the right meane. Furthermore let vs learne by this how readie the worlde is to fall to ſuperſtition. Yea this wickednes is in a maner born with vs, to be deſirous to adorn crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures with that which we take from God,</p>
               <p>Wherefore no maruell if new errours haue come abroade in all ages, ſeeing euery one of vs is euen from his mothers wombe, expert in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenting Idols. But leaſt men excuſe themſelues therewithall, this hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorie doeth witneſſe, that this is the fountaine of ſuperſtitions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe men are vnthankefull to God, and doe giue his glory to ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

For the Grecians and other ſtrangers were not wont to borrow their names of the latines, vnleſſe they were men of ſmall reputation. And it may be that ſome of the noble men of Rome came then to ſee his poſſeſſions, and is called the chiefe man of the yle: not becauſe he dwelt there, but becauſe no man could compare with him in wealth and poſſeſſions. And it is ſcarce probable that al the whole multitude of Grecians was lodged there three dayes. I do rather thinke that when he entertained the Centurion, he did alſo honor Paul and his companions, bicauſe being admoniſhed by the myracle, hee did beleeue that he was a man beloued of God. Notwithſtanding howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it bee, his hoſpitalitie was not vnrewarded. For ſhortly after the Lord reſtored his father to health by the hand of Paul, who was indeed ſicke of a dangerous diſeaſe. And by this meanes he meant to teſtifie, how greatly that courteſie which is ſhewed to menne in miſerie and to ſtrangers, doth pleaſe him. Although thoſe who are holpen be vnmind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and vnthankefull for that benefite which they haue receiued, or they bee not able to recompence thoſe who haue done good to them: yet god himſelf wil abu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dantly reſtore to men whatſoeuer they haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed at his commandement: &amp; he hath ſomtimes appointed to thoſe which bee mercifull and giuen to hoſpitalitie, ſome of his ſeruauntes which bring with them a bleſſing. This was nowe great honour in that Publius did lodge Chriſt in the perſon of Paule. Notwithſtanding this was added as an ouerplus, in that Paul came furniſhed with the gifte of healing, that he might not only recompence his courteſie, but alſo giue more then he had receiued.</p>
               <p>Alſo wee knowe not whether he learned the firſt principles of faith, as myracles doe for the moſt parte winne the rude and vnbeleeuers vnto faith, Luke mentioneth the kinde of diſeaſe, that hee may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="586" facs="tcp:7788:304"/> ſet foorth the grace of God. For ſeeing it is an harde matter to cure a bloodie fluxe, eſpecially when the ague is ioyned therewith: the olde man was cured thus ſodainly only by the laying on of hands and praier, not without the manifeſt power of God.</p>
               <p n="8">8 <hi>And had laid his hands vpon him.</hi> Paul declareth by prayer, that hee himſelfe is not the authour of the myracle, but onely the miniſter, leaſt God be defrauded of his glory. He confirmeth this ſelfe ſame thing by the externall ſigne. For as we ſaw before in other places, the laying on of hands was nothing els but a ſolemne rite of offering and preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. Wherefore in that Paul doth offer the man to God with his owne handes, he profeſſed that he did humbly craue his life of him. By which example not only thoſe who haue excellent giftes of the Spirite giuen them, are admoniſhed to beware leaſt by extolling them ſelues, they darken the glory of God: but alſo wee are all taught in generall, that we muſt ſo thanke the miniſters of the grace of God, that the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry remaine to him alone. It is ſaid in deede that Paule healed the man which had the bloodie flixe: but it is plainely expreſſed by the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances which are added, that it was God which beſtowed this benefite, making him the miniſter thereof. Whereas Luke ſaith afterwarde that others which were ſicke in the yle were cured, he doth not extend it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all: but his meaning is that the power of God which appeared eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ynough, was proued by many teſtimonies, that the Apoſtleſhip of Paul might be thereby ratified. Neither need we doubt but that Paul ſought as well to cure their ſoules as their bodies. Yet Luke doeth not declare what good he did: ſaue only that the Barbarians gaue him and his fellowes victuall and neceſſarie thinges when they looſed from the hauen. In the meane ſeaſon wee muſt note, that though Paul myght haue withdrawen himſelfe and haue eſcaped many wayes, yet was the will of God to him in ſteed of voluntarie fetters: becauſe he was often cited by the heauenly oracle to appeare before the iudgement ſeate of Nero, to beare witneſſe of Chriſt. Againe, he knew that if he ſhould run away, he could no longer haue preached the goſpel, but ſhoulde haue lurked in ſome corner during his whole life.</p>
               <p n="11">11 <hi>In a ſhip of Alexandria.</hi> By theſe wordes Luke giueth vs to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that the former ſhippe was either drowned, or els ſo rent and beaten that it ſerued for no vſe afterwarde: whereby the greatneſſe of the ſhipwracke doeth the better appeare. And hee ſetteth downe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly that the badge of the ſhip of Alexandria wherin they were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to Rome, was Caſtor and Pollux, that we may know that Paul had not libertie graunted to ſayle with ſuch as were like to himſelfe: but was enforced to enter into a ſhip which was dedicated to two Idols. The old Poets did feigne that Caſtor and Pollux came of Iupiter and Leda: for which cauſe they are called in Greeke <hi>dio ſcouroi:</hi> which word Luke vſeth in this place: as if you ſhould ſay, Iupiters ſonnes. Againe, they ſaid that they are the ſigne in the Zodiacke called Gemini. There was alſo another ſuperſtition among the marriners, that thoſe firie exhalations which appeare in tempeſts, are the very ſame. Therefore in times paſt
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:7788:304" rendition="simple:additions"/> they were thought to be gods of the ſeas, and were therefore called vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: as at this day Nicholas and Clement, &amp; ſuch like. Yea as in poperie they retain the old errors changing the names only: ſo at this day they worſhip theſe exhalations vnder the name of Saint Hermes, or Saint Ermus. And becauſe if one exhalation appeare alone, it is a dolefull to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: but if two together (as Plinie writeth) then they foreſhewe a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous courſe. To the end the mariners of Alexa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dria might haue both Caſtor and Pollux to fauour them: they had both for the badge of their ſhip. Therefore as touching them, the ſhippe was polluted with wicked ſacriledge: but becauſe Paul did not make choiſe thereof of his owne accord, he is not polluted thereby. And ſurely ſeing an Idol is nothing, it cannot in fect the creatures of God, but that the faithfull may vſe them purely and lawfully. And we muſt needes thinke thus, that al thoſe blottes wherewith Satan doth goe about to ſtaine the creatures of god through his iuggling, are waſhed away by no other means but by a good and pure conſcience, whereas the wicked and vngodly doe defile thoſe thinges which are of themſelues pure, though they do but touch them. Finally, Paul was no more defiled by entring into this ſhip, then when he did behold the altars at Athens: becauſe being void of al ſuperſtition, he knew that all the rites of the Gentiles were meere illuſions. Againe, the men could not thinke that he did agree to that profane error. For if hee had bin to doe any worſhip to Caſtor and Pollux though it had bin only for faſhions ſhake, hee would rather haue died a thouſand deaths, then once haue yeelded.</p>
               <p>Therefore becauſe he needed not to feare any offence, hee entreth the ſhip without any more adoe: and vndoubtedly he did this heauilie and with inward ſorrow: becauſe he ſaw the honour which is due to god alone, giuen to vaine inuentions. Therefore this ought to be numbred among his exerciſes, in that he had thoſe to be his guides, who thought that they were gouerned of Idols, and had committed their ſhip to their tuition.</p>
               <p n="12">12 <hi>When we were come to Syracuſa.</hi> Luke proſecuteth the reſidue of the courſe of their ſayling, that they arriued firſt in Sicilia. And after that they fet a compaſſe by reaſon of the tempeſt and raging of the ſea, and ſailed ouer into Italie. And as that hauen whereof Luke ſpeaketh in this place, is the moſt famous hauen of all Sicilia: ſo is it farther from the coaſt of Italie then is that of Meſſana, ouer againſt which is Rhegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, whereof he maketh mention. And it is in the countrie of the Bruti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, as is Puteoli a citie of Campania.

Neither do I doubt but that the holy man would haue made him a faithfull promiſe that hee would alwayes returne in due time. But he was perſuaded of his vprightneſſe, ſo that he was not afraid that he would deceiue him.

And the zeale and godly care of the brethren appeareth therein, in that they inquire for Pauls com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, and goe out to meete him. For it was at that time not onely an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious thing to profeſſe the chriſtian faith, but it might alſo bring them in haſſarde of their life. Neither did a few men only put themſelues in priuate daunger: becauſe the enuie redounded to the whole Churche. But nothing is more deare to them then their duty wherein they could not bee negligent vnleſſe they woulde bee counted ſluggiſhe and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankefull. It had beene a cruell fact to neglect ſo great an Apoſtle of Ieſus Chriſte, eſpecially ſeeing hee laboured for the common ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>And now foraſmuch as he had written to them before, and had of his owne accord offered his ſeruice to them, it had been an vnſeemly thing not to repay to him brotherly good will and curteſie. Therefore the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren did by this their dutifulnes teſtifie their godlines toward Chriſt: &amp; Pauls deſire was more inflamed, bicauſe he ſaw frute prepared for his conſtancie. For though he wer indued with inuincible ſtrength, ſo that he did not depend vpon mans helpe: yet God who vſeth to ſtrengthen his by meanes of men, did miniſter to him new ſtrength by this means. Though he were afterward forſaken when he was in priſon, as he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth in a certaine place, yet did he not deſpair: but did fight no leſſe valiantly and manfully vnder Chriſtes banner, than if he had been gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with a great armie.

<pb n="591" facs="tcp:7788:305" rendition="simple:additions"/> would yeeld no ſmall frute. For ſo often as God ſheweth to his ſeruants any frute of their labour, he doth as it were pricke them forward with a goad, that they may proceed more couragiouſly in their worke.</p>
               <p n="16">16 <hi>The Centurion deliuered the priſoners.</hi> Luke doeth ſignifie that Paul had more libertie graunted him then the reſt: for this condition and eſtate was peculiar. For he was ſuffered to dwell in an houſe by him ſelfe, hauing one keeper with him, where as the reſt were ſhut vp in the common priſon. For the generall captaine knewe by Feſtus his reporte, that Paul was giltleſſe: and the Centurion, as it is likely, did faithfully rehearſe ſuch things as might ſerue to bring him into fauour. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding let vs know that God did gouerne from heauen the bondes of his ſeruant: not only that hee might eaſe him of his trouble, but that the faithfull might haue freer acceſſe vnto him. For he would not haue the treaſure of his faith ſhut vp in priſon, but hee woulde haue it laid open, that it might enrich many farre and wide. And yet Paule was not ſo at libertie, but that he did alwayes carry a chaine. Luke calleth the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall captaine <hi>Stratopedarches,</hi> who was appointed ouer the armie whiche kept the citie, as hiſtories make mention.</p>
               <p n="17">17 <hi>And after three dayes.</hi> Paule his humanitie was wonderfull, in that, though he had ſuffered ſuch cruell iniuries of his nation, he ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth notwithſtanding to appeaſe the Iewes which are at Rome, and hee excuſeth himſelfe to them, leaſt they hate his cauſe, becauſe they heare that the prieſtes doe hate him. He might well haue excuſed him ſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men, if he had paſſed ouer theſe Iewes and turned him ſelfe to the Gentiles. For though hee had continually in diuers places aſſayed to bring them to Chriſt, yet they were more and more netled and moued? and yet he had omitted nothing neither in Aſia, nor in Grecia, neither at Ieruſalem, which might mittigate their furie. Therefore all men would haue iuſtly pardoned him, if he had let thoſe alone, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had ſo often tried to be of deſperate pride. But becauſe he knew that his maſter was giuen of his father to be the miniſter of the Iewes, to fulfil the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, whereby God had adopted to himſelfe the ſeede of Abraham to be his people: he looketh vnto the calling of God and is neuer wearie. He ſawe that he muſt remaine at Rome ſeeing he had libertie graunted to teache, he would not that they ſhould be depriued of the frute of his labor. Secondly he would not haue them moued through hatred of his cauſe, to trouble the church: becauſe a ſmall occaſion might haue cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed great deſtruction. Therefore Paul meant to beware, leaſt according to their wonted madneſſe they ſhould ſet all on fire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I haue done nothing againſt the people.</hi> Theſe two thinges might haue made the Iewes hate him: either becauſe hee ſhould haue done hurt to the common wealth of his nation, as ſom runnagates did increaſe their bondage which was too cruell, through their treacherie: or becauſe he ſhould haue done ſomewhat againſt the worſhip of God: for though the Iewes wer growen out of kinde, &amp; religion was depraued and corrupted among them with many errours, yet the very name of the lawe, and
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:7788:306"/> the worſhip of the temple were greatly reuerenced. Furthermore, Paul denieth not but that he did freely omit thoſe ceremonies whereto the Iewes were ſuperſtitiouſly tied: yet he cleereth himſelfe of the crime of reuolting whereof he might be ſuſpected. Therefore vnderſtande thoſe ordinances of the fathers, whereby the children of Abraham and the diſciples of Moſes ought according to their faith to haue beene diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from the reſt of the Gentiles. And ſurely in that he did cleeue ſo holily to Chriſte, who is the ſoule and perfection of the lawe, hee is ſo farre from impairing the ordinances of the fathers, that none did bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter obſerue the ſame.</p>
               <p n="19">19 <hi>I was enforced to appeale.</hi> This appeale was full of hatred and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie for this cauſe, becauſe the authoritie and libertie of the Iewiſh nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on did ſeeme to be ſore oppreſt, who coulde haue been content to haue liued with their owne lawes. Secondly, becauſe his defence was ioyned with infamie &amp; loſſe of all the people. Therfore he anſwereth this obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alſo: becauſe he was enforced with the ſtubbornnes of his enemies to flie to this fortreſſe. For he is excuſed by neceſſitie, becauſe hee had no other way to eſcape death. And after that hee had excuſed that which was done alreadie, he promiſeth that he wil ſo handle his matter hereafter, that he will not labour againſt the Iewes.</p>
               <p n="20">20 <hi>For the hope of Iſrael.</hi> Wee muſt vnderſtande much more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe wordes, then Luke expreſſeth: as we gather out of the anſwer, where the Iewes ſpeak of the ſect: to wit, repeating his ſpeeche, which Luke omitteth. Therfore Paul entreated of Chriſt, that it migh plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie appeare that neither, the lawe nor the temple did profite the Iewes anye thing without him: becauſe the couenaunt of adoption is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in him, and the promiſe of ſaluation is in him confirmed. Neither did they doubt but that the reſtoring of the kingdome did depend vpon the comming of the Meſſias: and euen at that time their miſerie and decay did increaſe the hope and deſire of him. Wherefore Paul ſaieth for good cauſes that he is bounde for the hope of Iſrael. Whereby we be alſo taught that no man doth hope aright, but hee which looketh vnto Chriſt and his ſpirituall kingdome: for when he placeth the hope of the godly in Chriſt, he excludeth all other hopes.</p>

For they did lord it no leſſe careleſly then proudly, ſo that no body did trouble them at home. Furthermore though the Iewes come not altogether rightly prepared to heare, yet they ſhewe ſome deſire to learne, when as they doe not refuſe to heare the defence of his doctrin, which is ſpoken againſt euery where. For many doe ſtop the way before themſelues with this preiudice, becauſe they cannot abide to hear that which is refuſed by common iudgement: but ſubſcribe to the opinion of other men to the condemning of doctrine which they know not. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe this is not without fault (as I ſaid) that they obect gain-ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to cauſe hatred, or to procure euill ſuſpition: as if it had not beene ſaid before by Iſaias, that god ſhould be a ſtone of offence to al the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. It is vncertaine whether vpon the day appointed Paule diſputed all the day, or they reaſoned one with another: ſaue only becauſe we may geſſe by the circumſtance of time, that Paul did not continue ſpeaking ſtill, For he could ſcarſe haue framed a ſpeech which could haue conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued from morning to night. Wherefore I doe not doubt but that after the Apoſtle had briefly expounded the ſumme of the goſpel, he graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted libertie to the hearers to propound queſtions, &amp; did make anſwere to the queſtions which wer obiected to him. But we muſt note the ſtate of the diſputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which Luke ſaith is double. For Paul taught firſt: after what ſort the kingdome of God was amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt them, and principally what manner chiefe felicitie and glory that was which was promiſed to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which the prophets doe ſo highly extoll. For ſeeing that many of them did dreame of a fraile eſtate of the kingdome of God in the world, &amp; did place the ſame falſly in idleneſſe, pleaſure, and in plentie of preſent good things, it was neceſſary that it ſhould be rightly defined, that they might know that the kingdome of God is ſpirituall: whoſe beginning is newneſſe of life, and the end thereof bleſſed immortalitie and the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly glory.</p>
               <p>Secondy Paule exhorted them to receiue Chriſte the authour of the promiſed felicitie, And againe this ſecond point had two members, for it could not be handled profitably and ſoundly, vnleſſe he did expound the office of the promiſed redeemer: ſecondly vnleſſe he did ſhewe that he is alreadie giuen, and that the ſonne of Mary is he in whom the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers hoped. It was in deed a common <hi>maxime</hi> among the Iewes that the Meſſias ſhould come and reſtore all things into perfect order. But Paul laboured another point, which was not ſo well knowen: that the Meſſias was promiſed, who ſhould with the ſacrifice of his death, make ſatisfaction for the ſinnes of the world, who ſhould reconcile GOD to men, who ſhould purchaſe eternal righteouſnes, who ſhould faſhion me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> after the image of God, being regenerate with his ſpirit, who ſhould fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally make his faithful ſeruants heires with him of eternally life.</p>
               <pb n="594" facs="tcp:7788:307"/>
               <p>And that all thoſe thinges were fulfilled in the perſon of Ieſus Chriſte crucified. He could not entreat of thoſe things, but he muſt needes call backe the Iewes from their groſſe and earthly inuentions into heauen, and alſo take away the ſtumbling blocke of the croſſe, ſeeing he taught that there was no other way or meanes whereby we are reconciled with God. And let vs note, that (as Luke doth teſtifie) Paul tooke all that which he ſpake of Chriſte out of the law and prophets. For true religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on differeth from all feigned relig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And now by this we ſee the agreement that is between the olde and the newe teſtaments to eſtabliſh the faith of Chriſt: ſecondly, that dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble profit of the ſcripture which the ſame Paul commendeth in another place: to wit, that it is ſufficient as well to inſtruct thoſe which are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to learne, as to refute the ſtubbornneſſe of thoſe which ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues againſt the truth.<note place="margin">2.

For behold whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Iewes come together to heare Paul, they thinke all one thing and ſpeake all one thing: they doe all profeſſe that they embrace the law of Moſes. So ſoone as they heare the doctrine of reconciliation, there ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth diſſentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſo that they are diuided. And yet for al this we muſt not think that the preaching of the Goſpel is the cauſe of diſcord: but that priuie diſpleſure which lurked before in their malicious minds, doth then breake out: and as the brightneſſe of the ſunne doth not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour things otherwiſe then they were: but doth plainely ſhew the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, which was none ſo long as it was dark. Therfore ſeeing God doth illuminate his elect peculiarly, and faith is not common to all men, let vs remember that it cannot be but that ſo ſoone as Chriſte commeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, there will be a diuiſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> among men. But the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> let vs cal to mind that which Simon foretold of him, that he ſhall be a ſigne which ſhall be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken againſt, that the thoughts of many hearts may be diſcloſed:<note place="margin">Luc. 2.34.35.</note> &amp; that vnbeleef which ſtriueth againſt God, is the mother of diſſention.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>After that Paul.</hi> At the firſt hee went about to allure them meeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and gently, now ſo ſoon as he eſpieth their obſtinacie, he inueigheth ſharply, &amp; doth ſeuerely denounce the iudgement of God: for the rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious muſt be handeled thus, whoſe pride cannot bee tamed with plaine doctrine. The ſame order muſt wee keep, wee muſt gently gouerne thoſe who are apt to be taught &amp; gentle: but we muſt cite the ſtubborne vnto Gods iudgement ſeat. Whereas hee bringeth in rather the holy Ghoſte ſpeaking, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the prophet, it maketh to the credite of the oracle. For ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God requireth that he alone bee heard, doctrine cannot otherwiſe be of authoritie, then if we know that it did proceed from him, and that it did not iſſue out of mans braine. Againe, hee declareth therewithall that the ſtubborneſſe of one age only, is not there noted, but that the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle of the ſpirite is extended vnto the time to come.</p>
               <p n="26">26 <hi>Go to this people.</hi> This is a notable place,<note place="margin">Mat. 13.14. Ioh. 12.40. Rom. 11.8. Mark. 4.12. Luk. 8.10.</note> becauſe it is cited ſixe times in the new Teſtament: but becauſe it is brought in els where to an other end, wee muſt marke for what purpoſe Paul applyeth it vnto the preſent cauſe. Namely, hee meant with this as with a mallet to beat in peeces the hardneſſe and frowardneſſe of the wicked: and to incourage the faithfull who were as yet weak and tender, leaſt the vnbeliefe of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhould trouble them.</p>
               <p>Therefore the ſum is, that that was fulfilled which was foretold by the
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:7788:308"/> prophet: &amp; that therfore there is no cauſe why the reprobate ſhould flatter themſelues, or that the faithfull ſhould be terrified as it wer with ſom new and vnwonted thing. And though it be certain that this blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe whereof the prophet ſpake, began in his time: yet Iohn ſheweth that it did properly appertaine vnto the kingdome of Chriſt. Therefore Paul doth fitly applie it vnto that contempt of the Goſpel which hee ſaw: as if he ſhould haue ſaid: this is the very ſame thing which the holy ghoſt foretold in times paſt by the mouth of Iſaias. And though this place be diuerſly applyed not only by the Euangeliſts, but alſo by Paule himſelfe, the ſhewe of contrarietie is eaſily put away and aunſweared. Matthew, Marke, and Luke ſay that this propheſie was fulfilled, when Chriſt ſpake by parables vnto the people, and did not reueale to them the myſteries of the kingdome of heauen. For then the vnfaithful hard the voice of God with their outward eares, but they did not profit ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. Iohn ſaith in a ſenſe not much vnlike to this, that the Iewes wer not brought to beleeue, no not with many myracles, ſo that this ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie of the prophet was fulfilled.<note place="margin">Ioh. 12.37.</note> Therefore theſe foure agree in this, that it came to paſſe by the iuſt iudgement of God that the reprobate in hearing ſhould not heare, and in ſeeing ſhould not ſee. Nowe Paul calleth to minde that which the prophete did teſtifie concerning the Iewes,<note place="margin">Rom. 11.5.7.</note> leaſt any man wonder at their blindneſſe. Furthermore, in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle to the Romanes, hee mounteth higher, ſhewing that this is the cauſe of blindneſſe, becauſe God doth giue the light of faith only to the remnant whom he hath choſen freely. And ſurely it is certaine that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the reprobate reiect the doctrine of ſaluation, this commeth to paſſe through their owne malice, and that therefore they them ſelues are to be blamed. But this next cauſe doth not let but that the ſecrete electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of god may diſtinguiſh between me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: that thoſe may beleue who are ordeined to life, and that the other may remaine blockiſh. <hi>I</hi> will not ſtand long about the wordes of the prophet, becauſe I haue expounded the ſame elswhere. Neither did Paul curiouſly recite the woords which are in the prophet: but did rather apply his woordes vnto his purpoſe. Therefore he imputeth that making blinde, which the prophet attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to the ſecrete iudgement of God to their malice. For the prophet is commaunded to ſtop the eyes of his hearers: and Paul in this place accuſeth the vnbeleeuing of his time, becauſe they ſhut their own eyes. Though he ſetteth downe both thinges diſtinctly, that God is the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of their blindneſſe, and that yet notwithſtanding they ſhut their owne eyes and become blinde of their owne accorde: as theſe two thinges doe very well agree together, as we ſaide els where. In the laſt memember where it is ſaid, Leaſt they ſee with their eies, or heare with their eares, or vnderſtand with their hearte: God ſheweth howe cleare his doctrine is: to wit, that it is ſufficient to lighten all the ſenſes, vnleſſe men doe maliciouſly darken them ſelues: as Paul alſo teacheth in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other place, that his Goſpel is plaine ſo that none can be blinde in the light thereof,<note place="margin">

               <p>
                  <hi>Leaſt they be conuerted and I heale them.</hi> By this we gather that the word of God is not ſet before all men that they may returne to ſoundneſſe of minde: but that the externall voice ſoundeth in the eares of manie without the effectual working of the Spirit, only that they may be made inexcuſable. And here the pride of fleſh doeth raſhly murmure againſt God: as we ſee many obiect, that men are called in vaine, yea abſurdlie, vnleſſe it be in their power to obey: for though we ſee no reaſon why god appeareth to the blinde, and ſpeaketh to the deafe: yet his will alone which is the rule of all righteouſneſſe, ought to bee to vs in ſteed of a thouſand reaſons. In the concluſion wee muſt note the wholſome effect of the word of God: namely the conuerſion of men: which is not onelie the beginning of health: but alſo a certaine reſurrection from death to life.</p>
               <p n="28">28 <hi>Therefore be it.</hi> Leaſt the Iewes may afterward accuſe him of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolting, becauſe hee forſaketh the holy ſtock of Abraham and goeth to the prophane Gentiles: he denounceth that which the Prophets did ſo often teſtifie, that The ſaluation whereof they were the proper, at leaſt the principall heires, ſhould be tranſlated vnto ſtrangers. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding whereas he ſaith that ſaluation was ſent to the Gentiles: he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, in the ſecond place: to wit, after that the Iewes had reiected it, as we haue ſaid before more at large. Therefore the ſenſe is, that there is no cauſe why the Iewes ſhould complaine,<note place="margin">Sup. 13.46.</note> if the Gentiles be admitted into the void poſſeſſion after that they haue forſaken it. Neither doth he make faith common to all the Gentiles in generall, when hee ſaieth that they ſhall heare. For he had ful well tried, that euen many of the Gentiles did wickedly reſiſt God: but he ſetteth ſo many of the Gentiles as beleeued, againſt the vnbeleeuing Iewes,<note place="margin">Deut. 32.21</note> that he may prouoke them vnto iealouſie: as it is in the ſong of Moſes. In the meane ſeaſon he ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth that the doctrine which they refuſe ſhall profit others.</p>
               <p n="29">29 <hi>Hauing much reaſoning.</hi> No doubt the wicked were more netled becauſe he cited the Propheſie againſt them: for they are ſo farre from waxing meeke when they are reproued, that they are more inflamed with fury. This is the reaſon why they reaſoned when they were gone out from Paul, bicauſe the more part would not be quiet. But ſeing there was ſuch diſputing: it appeareth that ſome did ſo embrace thoſe things which Paul had ſpoken, that they doubted not to defend and ſtoutly to auouch that which they beleeued. But it is in vaine for any man to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect thereupon, that the Goſpell of Chriſt is the ſeede of contention, which commeth vndoubtedly from mans pride and waywardneſſe: and aſſuredly if we will haue peace with God, wee muſt ſtriue againſt thoſe which contemne him.</p>
               <p n="30">30 <hi>He receiued al.</hi> The Apoſtle ſhewed an excellent example of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie, in that hee offered himſelfe ſo willingly to all thoſe which were deſirous to heare him. Surely hee was not ignorant what great hatred he did purchaſe: and that this was his beſt way, if by holding his peace hee might appeaſe the hatred of his aduerſaries. For a man being deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to prouide for himſelfe alone, woulde not haue done thus: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:7788:309"/> he remembred that he was no leſſe the ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Chriſt &amp; a prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of the Goſpell when he was in priſon, then if he had bin at libertie, he thoght it was not lawfull for him to withdraw himſelfe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any which was readie to learn, leaſt he ſhould foreſlow the occaſion which was offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him by God, and therefore he did more regarde the holie calling of God then his owne life. And that we may knowe that he did incurre daunger willingly, Luke doth ſhortly after expreſſely commend his bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: as if he ſhuld ſay that ſetting al feare aſide he did faithfully obey the commandement of God, neither was he terrified with any daunger, but did proceed to take paines with whomſoeuer he met.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Preaching the kingdom of God.</hi> He doth not ſeperate the kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e of God and thoſe thinges which belong to Chriſt as diuers things, but doth ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther adde the ſecond thing by way of expoſition, that we may know that the kingdome of God is grounded and contayned in the knowledge of the rede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ption purchaſed by Chriſt. Therfore paul taught, that men are ſtrangers &amp; forrayners fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the kingdom of God vntil hauing their ſins done away they be reconciled to God, &amp; renewed into holines of life by the ſpirit: and that the kingdome of God is then erected and doth then floriſh among them, when Chriſt the mediatour doth ioyne them to the father, hauing both their ſinnes freely forgiuen them, and being alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate vnto righteouſnes, that beginning the heauenly life vpon earth they may alwayes haue a longing deſire to come to heauen, where they ſhall fullie and perfectly enioy glorie. Alſo Luke ſetteth foorth a ſingular benifit of God in that Paul had ſo great libertie graunted him. For that came not to paſſe through the winking and diſſimulation of thoſe who could hinder it, ſeeing they did deteſt religion: but becauſe the Lord did ſhut their eyes.<note place="margin">2.
